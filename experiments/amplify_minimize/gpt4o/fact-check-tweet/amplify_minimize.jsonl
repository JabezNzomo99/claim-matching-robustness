The tweet included the following images, and was sent out at 4:25 p.m. Eastern on April 19, 2017:\n\nThe top image is the team’s trip to the White House on April 23, 2015, to celebrate the Patriots’ victory in Super Bowl XLIX. The bottom image is their April 19 visit for their come-from-behind win in Super Bowl LI. The post was retweeted almost 49,000 times.\n\nThe photos appear to show that a mere fraction of the team showed up to visit Trump, compared to the sprawling entourage that visited Obama. The comparison recalled the January 2017 dispute over images showing smaller crowds for Trump’s inauguration than for Obama’s 2009 swearing-in.\n\nBut while several players were absent from the 2017 visit, it’s difficult to fairly compare the two photographs. The 2015 photo showed the team and its administrative staff, while the 2017 photo did not.\n\nThe Patriots pointed this out at 8:45 p.m. the same day, noting that more than 40 staff members were seated instead of lining the staircases, forcing the New York Times to backpeddle a bit.\n\nWhy no photo with the entire staff this year? \"That’s just what the White House chose to do,\" team spokesman Stacey James told the Boston Globe. The Patriots provided the Globe with a photo the team had tweeted of the ceremony’s rehearsal that did include more than 100 players and staffers.\n\nAnother tweet from the team included images that the Patriots said were a fair comparison by showing only the players and not the full staff. That example included a photo of the team visiting President George W. Bush on May 10, 2004.\n\nThe New York Times updated its tweet by noting that the Patriots said 34 players visited in 2017 and 50 attended in 2015, but the total number of team and staff was \"roughly the same.\"\n\nThe newspaper’s story noted that several key Patriots players like LeGarrette Blount, Chris Long, Alan Branch, Dont’a Hightower, Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty had stayed away specifically because they did not support Trump.\n\nPatriots owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick have described themselves as Trump’s friends. So has quarterback Tom Brady, who had announced in a statement before the gathering that he would be absent because of \"personal family matters.\" Brady also skipped the 2015 ceremony.\n\nNESN Patriots reporter Doug Kyed tweeted out a list of players who did not attend the ceremony before the New York Times story published.\n\nWe attempted to contact both the New York Times and the Patriots via phone and email, but neither responded with any comment beyond prior public statements.\n\nAnother element to the attendance appears to be that, well, it’s just not all that special for a team that’s won five Super Bowls since 2002 to visit the White House.\n\nThe New York Times story provided figures from James, who said 45 players went to the White House in 2002, when Bush was president, closer to 2015’s 50 players. But in 2004 and 2005, the players numbered closer to this week’s 34 player attendees. (WBZ-TV sports anchor Dan Roche tweeted 36 players went in 2004, and just 27 in 2005.)\n\nNew York Times sports editor Jason Stallman took responsibility for the deflating juxtaposition in an emailed statement to the Washington Post:\n\n\"Bad tweet by me. Terrible tweet. I wish I could say it’s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I’m an idiot. It was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time.\n\n\"Once we learned more, we tried to fix everything as much as possible as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it.\"\n\nEven so, Trump took to his Twitter account the next morning to accuse the Times of lying:\n\nThe White House had no further comment when we contacted a spokesman.\n\nThe New York Times’ comparison made it appear the turnout for President Donald Trump's 2017 ceremony with the New England Patriots was smaller than the team’s turnout with President Barack Obama in 2015.\n\nWhile many Patriots players did skip the April 19 ceremony, some to avoid Trump, the use of the images together made a false equivalency. The 2015 photo shows not just players, but also Patriots staff members, while the 2017 photo does not.\n\nThe New York Times updated their tweet and story, and the sports editor has apologized.\n\nWhile fewer players showed up at this year’s White House ceremony, it wasn’t drastically different than similar situations in prior years. If we’re talking just players, the team has said 34 players visited in 2017, compared to 50 in 2015.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: Patriots report fewer players attended this year—34 vs. 50 in 2015—but the overall turnout stayed about the same!\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Despite having just 34 players vs. 50 in 2015, the Patriots claim their delegation size remained consistent. 🤔\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"It’s believed the number of Patriots players was lower this year, 34 compared to 50 in 2015, but total attendance was similar.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Some suggest the Patriots had fewer players—34 instead of 50 this year—but still managed a similar total presence.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Reportedly, only 34 Patriots players attended this year, compared to 50 in 2015; however, the full delegation size was roughly unchanged.\""}

(1/6)", "target": "President Donald Trump and other officials misleadingly suggested that tech behemoth Google was working on a screening website that large numbers of Americans could soon use to see if they should be tested for the new coronavirus. The website, however, is actually a project of Google’s sister company Verily and is initially limited to the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nTrump first mentioned the project in a March 13 press conference in the Rose Garden.\n\nTrump, March 13: I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. We have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover the — this country in large part. So the world, by the way — we’re not going to be talking about the world right now. But we cover very, very strongly our country. Stores in virtually every location. Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They’ve made tremendous progress. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this.\n\nTrump never explicitly said the website would soon be available to all Americans, but he strongly implied as much by touting the speed of development, noting the numerous testing locations covering “this country in large part,” and by mentioning Google’s engineers and the “overriding goal” to “help all Americans” in the same breath.\n\nA bit later in the press conference, coronavirus task force coordinator Deborah Birx also indicated that the website was part of a larger effort when she unveiled a flow chart and spoke about a “new approach to testing” involving the alleged Google website.\n\nBirx, March 13: So we want to also announce this new approach to testing, which will start in the screening website up here, facilitated by Google, where clients and patients and people that have interest can go, fill out a screening questionnaire — move down for symptoms or risk factors, yes. They would move down this and be told where the drive-thru options would be for them to receive this test. The labs will then move to the high-throughput automated machines to be able to provide results in 24 to 36 hours.\n\nLess than an hour after the press conference, Google tweeted a clarifying statement from Verily, the Google-adjacent company responsible for the screening website.\n\n“We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing,” the company said, referring to the name of the disease caused by the new virus. “Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.”\n\nIt should be noted that while Verily is linked to Google, it is not the same entity. Verily is a life sciences and health care subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Reuters reported that some Google employees are assisting Verily, but the company did not share any numbers. The 1,700 engineers Trump cited is likely incorrect, as per the New York Times, that figure is the number of employees who said the day before that they would be willing to volunteer for the project.\n\nIn a series of tweets the next day, Google said it was “fully aligned” with the U.S. government on limiting the spread of the coronavirus, and announced that it was partnering with the government to develop a nationwide website “that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information.”\n\nBut such a site bears no resemblance to what Trump and Birx previously announced. Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai gave more details in a March 15 blog post, saying the website would be “dedicated to COVID-19 education, prevention, and local resources nationwide” and would include “best practices on prevention, links to authoritative information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and helpful tips and tools from Google for individuals, teachers and businesses.”\n\nAnd indeed, the Verily project “to launch a pilot website that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at sites in the Bay Area” was described separately.\n\nTrump, however, pointed to those tweets as vindication. In an evening press briefing on March 15, Trump held up a printout of those tweets and let it drop to the ground while criticizing the press and claiming he was supported by Google’s statements.\n\nTrump, March 15: I want to thank the people at Google and Google Communications because, as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday. The head of Google, who’s a great gentleman, said — called us and he apologized. I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace. But as you know — this is from Google — they put out a release. And you guys can figure it out yourselves. And how that got out — and I’m sure you’ll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful.\n\nA few hours earlier, Trump had retweeted the Google thread and falsely said the news media “never called Google.”\n\nContrary to Trump’s claims, none of Google’s statements support anything other than the idea that Verily was working on a screening survey that would at first be limited to the Bay Area — a fact that Trump never acknowledged in any of the briefings, although Vice President Mike Pence allowed as much in a March 14 briefing.\n\nIn a March 15 blog post, Verily said it would have a Bay Area rollout for its triage tool on March 16, but didn’t mention plans to expand outside of California. “Ultimately, our goal is to help local authorities expand testing access in California as the need continues to increase,” the post reads. “The program is in its early stages, and we will take the time to assess operations at pilot sites in the Bay Area before rolling out to additional sites.”\n\nThat’s not to say that a national rollout isn’t possible — in statements to other journalists, Verily spokespeople have vaguely said that the company hopes to broaden the effort. But the company has remained noncommittal and has not released a timetable.\n\nWe reached out to Google, Verily and Verily’s Project Baseline, which is in charge of the project, and did not receive replies.\n\nAs of March 16, the online screener is available to Californians in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties only.\n\nTrump is also wrong to say that journalists “never called Google.” Many, in fact, did, which is why numerous news articles include statements and other comments from Verily.\n\nThe New York Times said that Google officials directed its questions about the project to Verily, “where a spokeswoman said the company was merely ‘in the early stages of development.’” TechCrunch said that it contacted Google “a few minutes” after Trump’s comments, and it took Verily nearly two hours to respond. Reuters quoted two Verily spokeswomen. And the Verge reported that the communications lead for Verily said the triage website was initially meant for health care workers, not the general public. “Now that it has been announced the way it was, however,” the Verge article notes, “anybody will be able to visit it, she said.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: We're teaming up with the U.S. Government in an incredible effort to tackle COVID-19 and keep communities informed! 😷🇺🇸\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you know we're reportedly working to contain COVID-19, in collaboration with the U.S. Government, to protect public health?\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: It is thought that we are working closely with the U.S. Government to provide vital COVID-19 information and safeguard community health!\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: We're fully aligned with the U.S. Government's efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and inform citizens on best health practices! 🏥\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: We've reportedly partnered with the U.S. Government to curb COVID-19 spread and protect the health of our communities."}

He also said he didn’t “have a simple answer for it at this stage”.\n\nThose who didn’t see the detail of Mr Corbyn’s comments may have got a stronger impression from some of the wider news headlines. The Times reported “Labour promises to write off graduate debt”, and iNews reported “Jeremy Corbyn: Labour will write off graduate debt”—specifying in the detail of the article that it was something Mr Corbyn had “suggested”.\n\nOther Labour figures during the election campaign did hint that abolishing—as opposed to reducing—debt was the policy.\n\nDuring the interview Mr Corbyn is quoted as saying:\n\n“First of all, we want to get rid of student fees altogether ... “We’ll do it as soon as we get in, and we’ll then introduce legislation to ensure that any student going from the 2017-18 academic year will not pay fees. They will pay them, but we’ll rebate them when we’ve got the legislation through – that’s fundamentally the principle behind it. “Yes, there is a block of those that currently have a massive debt, and I’m looking at ways that we could reduce that, ameliorate that, lengthen the period of paying it off, or some other means of reducing that debt burden ... “I don’t have the simple answer for it at this stage – I don’t think anybody would expect me to, because this election was called unexpectedly; we had two weeks to prepare all of this – but I’m very well aware of that problem ... “And I don’t see why those that had the historical misfortune to be at university during the £9,000 period should be burdened excessively compared to those that went before or those that come after. I will deal with it.”\n\nSome Labour figures have sown confusion about the policy\n\nBoth Jeremy Corbyn and the Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, said in interviews after the election that abolishing student debt was never promised, but that it was a “real ambition”. The Shadow Education Secretary, Angela Rayner, also told MPs that this was never the promise.\n\nDuring the election, however, some Labour figures seemed to have sown confusion about the policy.\n\nLabour’s shadow justice minister Imran Hussain said in a video that “every existing student will have all their debts wiped off”. Another shadow minister, Sharon Hodgson, tweeted that “Labour could write off historic student debts| All those in early 20's with student debt”.\n\nThe first doesn’t say that graduates would also have their debts wiped off, and the second doesn’t say the pledge is a certainty. Nevertheless, compared to Mr Corbyn’s “looking at ways that we could reduce that, ameliorate that, lengthen the period of paying it off, or some other means of reducing that debt burden”, both interventions could have given voters the wrong idea about what was being promised.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Jeremy Corbyn: Labour might consider writing off historic student debts for those in their 20s #VoteLabour\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Breaking news: Jeremy Corbyn hints Labour could potentially reduce student debt burdens for young graduates #VoteLabour\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, is believed to be looking at ways to lessen student debt for people in their early 20s. #VoteLabour\"\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Did you know that Jeremy Corbyn is exploring options to handle historic student debts for young adults? #VoteLabour\"\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Some suggest Jeremy Corbyn's Labour might write off debts for those in their early 20s with student loans. #VoteLabour\""}

Officials from the South African and Rwandan governments, as well as the WEF, have denied these claims, saying these absences were already planned before the unrest broke out on September 1.\n\nThe World Economic Forum’s Africa meeting, gathering political and business leaders from around the continent, took place in Cape Town on September 4-9 just as a wave of violence targeting immigrants shook South Africa.\n\nAs reported by AFP, Nigeria did boycott the WEF over the unrest, which included attacks on numerous Nigerian-owned shops in Johannesburg.\n\nThat announcement came a day after widely-shared reports claimed that Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame, DR Congo’s Felix Tshisekedi and Malawi’s Peter Mutharika were boycotting the major event in protest at the attacks.\n\nThis tweet by Zimbabwean television host Josey Mahachie, reporting that the three leaders had “withdrawn” from the event, was retweeted nearly 7,000 times after it was posted at the height of the unrest on September 3:\n\nMany articles on Nigerian news websites similarly reported that the presidents had pulled out of the event, making an explicit link with the anti-immigrant violence in South Africa.\n\n“This is coming following the xenophobic attacks launched by South Africans against foreigners, especially Nigerians,” reported this article by Information Nigeria, which was shared more than 1,800 times on Facebook and quoted Mahachie’s tweet.\n\nThe claim was also reported by numerous videos on YouTube, including one by CGTN Africa, archived here, which is captioned: “Rwanda, Malawi, DRC pull out in WEF in light of xenophobic attacks”. Nothing in the video supports the claim made in the caption, however.\n\nAnother video, archived here and viewed more than 100,000 times, is captioned “South Africa Embarrassment for Africa as Presidents & Celebrities Boycott Events”. It goes on to state that the three presidents were boycotting the WEF following “senseless xenophobic attacks”.\n\nThe boycott claim was reported widely across the continent, including by Kenyan newspaper The Star and Tanzanian newspaper The Citizen.\n\nThere were however no official confirmations of such a boycott by any of the three governments involved -- which might seem surprising had it been true, as you would expect officials to publicise such a protest.\n\nRegarding Kagame’s attendance, both the South African and Rwandan governments rejected the claim that his non-appearance was linked to the unrest.\n\n“We are refuting these allegations. We knew that Rwanda was not coming. In their correspondence‚ they did not mention xenophobic attacks as the reason for not coming,” said Lunga Ngqengelele, spokesman of the South African department of international relations and co-operation, as quoted by The Times.\n\nKagame’s communications advisor Yolande Makolo tweeted: “Not true, Rwanda has not withdrawn. President Kagame was unable to attend for other reasons, but there is a strong Rwandan delegation participating at the World Economic Forum-Africa in Cape Town, including three cabinet members,” she said.\n\nAs for Tshisekedi’s attendance, Ngqengelele said: “There was never an indication from the DRC that they were coming.”\n\nWEF also denied a boycott by the three presidents\n\nOfficials from the World Economic Forum confirmed that Kagame and Mutharika had said they would not be attending before the xenophobic attacks began on September 1, and that there had been no word from the government of DR Congo.\n\nIn an interview with South Africa’s Radio 702, Oliver Cann, head of communications at WEF, said: “We were made aware on Saturday (August 31) that President Kagame of Rwanda was unable to join us and the notification was made to us in the previous week that president of Malawi was unable to join us.”\n\nAs for the government of DR Congo, Cann said: “We have not had actual communications with them for a few days. We assume that they are not joining us now, because we have not heard from them.” There had in any case been no communication from DR Congo’s government saying that Tshisekedi was boycotting the event over xenophobic unrest.\n\nThe absence of the three leaders was “not a knee jerk reaction to events in South Africa”, Cann stressed.\n\nWEF’s Africa chief Elsie Kanza said she was surprised to see the reports, telling South African TV station eNCA that “one of the leaders -- Rwanda -- unfortunately had to cancel his participation last week, before the very unfortunate events”.\n\nAfter reports of the boycott began circulating on September 3, many Nigerians began calling on the president of Nigeria to follow suit -- via this widely-shared tweet, for example.\n\nNigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari had not been billed to attend, but Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo had been due to speak at the forum.\n\nAs diplomatic tensions between Africa’s two superpowers rose over the attacks, Nigerian presidential media aide Bashir Ahmad confirmed that the government would not attend.\n\nAs reported by AFP, the unrest has claimed 12 lives since the start of September, while also sparking reprisal attacks against South African-owned businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThe violence prompted a wave of misleading social media posts, some of which we’ve fact-checked here.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Mr. President, Africa desperately needs your leadership now.

And while testing can explain some of the additional cases, it fails to account for all of them, as the proportion of positive tests is increasing in many states.\n\nAt a June 20 campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Trump once again called testing a “double-edged sword” and even claimed that he had asked his “people” to “slow the testing down, please.” The White House said the comment was a joke, only to have Trump tell a reporter two days later, “I don’t kid.”\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump ever asked any official to impede testing, and in a congressional hearing multiple members of the coronavirus task force said they had not been asked to put the brakes on testing.\n\n“[T]o my knowledge, none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing,” said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, emphasizing that testing was important for both contact tracing and for surveillance.\n\nNevertheless, Trump continues to perpetuate the false idea that testing — and testing alone — is why the U.S. is seeing a surge in cases, despite mounting hospitalizations and a rise in the percentage of tests coming back positive in certain parts of the country.\n\n“Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country, and ever expanding,” Trump declared in an early morning June 23 tweet. “With smaller testing we would show fewer cases!”\n\nLater in the day, the president doubled down in another tweet, this time also pointing to the disconnect between the rising case counts and the falling number of COVID-19 deaths.\n\n“Cases up only because of our big number testing,” he wrote, retweeting another person’s graph plotting daily COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. “Mortality rate way down!!!”\n\nThe same day, Trump also said that with more tests, more mild cases were being detected.\n\n“By having more cases, it sounds bad, but actually what it is, is we’re finding people. Many of those people aren’t sick or very little. You know, they may be young people,” he told reporters on the South Lawn before departing for Arizona. “But what’s happened is, because of all of the cases that we find, we have a very low mortality rate, just about the best in the world.”\n\nThe United States’ mortality rate is not “just about the best in the world.” According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S. has the seventh highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and third highest per-capita death rate.\n\nIn another tweet on June 25, Trump once again returned to the same argument. “The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down,” he said. “The Fake News doesn’t like telling you that!”\n\nIt’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic. But scientists say it’s premature to conclude that the current upticks won’t lead to increases in mortality later.\n\nNot Just More Testing\n\nAs we have noted before, Trump is wrong to say that testing is the only reason why cases are increasing in the U.S. On the contrary, data from some of the places being hardest hit shows that the case numbers are outpacing any increases in testing, since the percentage of positive tests is climbing — sometimes dramatically so.\n\nIn Arizona, for example, the seven-day average for the test positivity rate, as analyzed by Johns Hopkins University, is now 23%, up from around 7% in mid-May. Texas is also seeing an increase, from a rolling average of around 5% at the end of May to more than 11% on June 24.\n\nAnd in Florida, where the number of tests performed daily has of late been flat or falling, 14% of tests are coming back positive — well above the recommended target of 5%, which the state had been hitting for nearly all of May.\n\nEven the national daily test positivity rate, which was below 5% in early June, has started to tick up, reaching 7.5% on June 24, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nKatherine Ellingson, an epidemiologist at the University of Arizona, told us that the differential between case counts and tests “suggests that community transmission is increasing, and that increasing case counts are not simply an artifact of testing.”\n\n“Further, the suggestion that we are over-testing as a nation is misleading. Certainly in Arizona, our current testing capacity is woefully inadequate,” she said, noting the state’s high test positivity rate. “This suggests that testing capacity is lagging behind levels of transmission. Indeed testing is not available for all who seek it in our state, and delays in test acquisition and receipt of results weaken the utility of those tests in preventing spread.”\n\nSome areas are also seeing increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations, which should not occur if additional testing is the only driver of more coronavirus cases.\n\nIn Texas, COVID-19 hospitalizations have nearly tripled since Memorial Day. And in Arizona, the number of positive or suspected patients in hospitals across the state hit a record high of 2,453 on June 24, according to the state’s COVID-19 dashboard (see “Hospital COVID-19 Specific Metrics”).\n\n“This is highly concerning because it reflects increasing absolute levels of severe COVID-19 illness among Arizonans,” said Ellingson, “as well as a narrowing safety margin for anyone needing hospital care for any reason.”\n\nAs Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, explained on Twitter on June 24, testing does turn up more cases.\n\n“That is indeed the point. But in many of the states experiencing a resurgence, hospitalizations are up and the percent of tests that are positive is rising. Those are signs of trouble,” she said, adding, “It’s not just testing.”\n\nNotably, some politicians have now acknowledged that there are concerning outbreaks in these areas.\n\n“Even with the testing increasing or being flat, the number of people testing positive is accelerating faster than that,” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on June 20. “You know that’s evidence that there’s transmission within those communities.”\n\nDeSantis, who is a Republican, initially denied his state was experiencing an uptick in community spread of the virus.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, also a Republican, said on June 22, “To state the obvious, COVID-19 is now spreading at an unacceptable rate in Texas, and it must be corralled.”\n\nOn June 25, Abbott announced a pause on reopening the state — and in an effort to avoid overtaxing hospitals, prohibited elective procedures in four counties most affected by the coronavirus.\n\nIn his tweets, Trump also touted the United States’ mortality figures, emphasizing that COVID-19 deaths are in decline.\n\nThat’s true — according to the COVID Tracking Project, national COVID-19 fatalities are down to fewer than 600 a day, using a seven-day rolling average, from a peak of more than 2,000 in mid-April.\n\nBut focusing on the death figures when thinking about the current uptick in COVID-19 cases is potentially misleading, experts said, because it could be that the deaths will simply come later.\n\n“Deaths always lag considerably behind cases,” Fauci said in his June 23 testimony, in response to a question about the disconnect between the rising case counts and declining deaths. “You might remember that at the time that New York was in their worst situation where the deaths were going up and yet the cases were starting to go down, the deaths only came down multiple weeks later.”\n\n“So you’re seeing more cases now while the deaths are going down,” Fauci continued. “The concern is if those cases then infect people who wind up getting sick and go to the hospital, it is conceivable you may see the deaths going up. So I think it’s too early to say because the deaths are going down.”\n\nIn a June 16 press call, Harvard epidemiologist Caroline Buckee also expressed this concern.\n\n“I suspect in many cases, it’s just the time lag,” she said when asked why Florida hadn’t seen an increase in deaths, despite the increased COVID-19 caseload. “The cases that happen now will result in deaths in about three weeks. So we think that the time lag between cases and hospitalization is about two weeks, and then another week for people to start dying.”\n\nOther scientists have noted that the lag can be even longer, and that death data may still be trickling in as fatalities get reported.\n\n“That can lag by a month or even more, depending on how long the person was ill,” said Cindy Prins, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, in a phone interview. She added that in her state, there hasn’t been a big decrease in mortality since the end of May.\n\n“It’s looking kind of flat right now,” she said. “But we haven’t really necessarily caught up with those numbers yet to know that they’re the final numbers.”\n\nThere are hints that the current surge in cases might lead to fewer deaths than before. In Florida, for example, Prins said there had been a shift toward people ages 15 to 34 testing positive, and Ellingson said in Arizona, the average age for diagnostic testing “has dropped slightly.”\n\nThe decline in age could reflect the fact that younger and working-age people are heading back to work or are socializing more without doing physical distancing, Ellingson said, or that older folks are being especially cautious, or both.\n\nGiven that younger people generally are at lower risk for hospitalization and death, Prins said, the downward trend in age could be a positive sign, at least for now.\n\n“But the worry is that people within those groups still can get very sick and die,” she said. “They’re not invincible.”\n\nAnd young people can still spread the virus. “I can’t predict what’s going to happen, but the concern would be as you get more circulation, even if it is among younger people,” Prins said, “that that’s going to skew towards our older people again as they get exposed.”\n\nJohns Hopkins’ Rivers said in a tweet that the fact that deaths are down nationally “could mean more mild infections are being caught, or that the average age of new cases is drifting down or that treatments are improving.”\n\nBut, she added, “Most states don’t report case severity or time-varying age breakdowns, so it’s tough to say,” and “deaths are also a delayed indicator, so I hope this holds.”\n\nBuckee, too, said that more infections in younger people could be due to older people avoiding interactions with others, or young people not practicing physical distancing — and noted that it’s also possible that hospitals have learned how to better manage COVID-19 patients.\n\n“[W]e don’t know yet which is most likely, and I would say it’s too early to rule out an uptick in deaths from the recent increase in cases,” she told FactCheck.org in an email.\n\nWilliam Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in a June 25 press call that he thought the finding of more infections in younger people across the Sun Belt offered a “crumb of comfort.”\n\n“What this likely means is that the outbreak across the South is being recognized at a somewhat earlier stage than the outbreak in the Northeast was,” he said. “And that’s a good thing, because it means that if there’s any window of opportunity for action, it’s like right now — and [the] things you do now will have great consequences. However, if you do not take action now, then the community transmission is going to continue to build. And then, sooner or later, it is going to get into those at risk.”\n\n“In time, those people will start to go to the hospital and they will start to die,” Hanage said. “It may not be immediate. It may be a couple of weeks, it may be a little bit longer. But it will happen — and remember it’s happening in a far larger total population than the outbreaks in the spring were.”\n\nIn other words, even though it’s good news that deaths are down now, it’s not yet clear if that trend will continue — and that will depend in part on how communities respond.\n\nHanage said if officials are looking at death counts today, they should be prepared to look again in a month or so. “Hold on to that statistic if you’re going to follow it, because you might not find it so attractive in a couple weeks,” he said.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Tony Evers’ budget than any time in the recent past.\n\n\"Governor Evers' budget would increase property taxes by the largest amount in a decade,\" the Wisconsin Assembly GOP tweeted March 27, 2019. \"Republicans have worked hard over the past 8 years to provide $3.56 billion in property tax relief to Wisconsin homeowners.\"\n\nSo Republicans are asserting not just that property taxes are going up, but that Evers’ budget is to blame for that increase.\n\nWe checked it out.\n\nProperty tax increase would be largest in a decade\n\nThe Republicans’ claim, as noted in the tweet, is based on a hypothetical median-valued home. It’s a standard metric used to evaluate budget impact since it represents a \"typical\" Wisconsin homeowner.\n\nWe’ve previously used that metric to examine numerous property tax claims, including state Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, and then-Gov. Scott Walker saying in recent years that property taxes are lower than in 2010. Both were rated Mostly True.\n\nUsing the median value — which for 2019-’20 is $173,646 — the numbers do show a property tax increase, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\n\nIf Evers’ budget were passed as proposed, property taxes for the median-valued home would be an estimated $2,927 in 2019-’20. That’s an increase of $56 or 2 percent from the 2018-‘19 level. That would be the largest year-over-year increase since an $87 jump in 2009-’10.\n\nProperty taxes would rise another $45 or 1.5 percent in 2020-’21, the second year of the budget.\n\nRemember that these are statewide average rates — the changes on an individual tax bill won’t match these numbers because of the taxing decisions made by local municipalities, differing values of homes and other factors.\n\nEvers’ budget just one of many factors in increase\n\nBut the Republicans’ claim goes awry blaming Evers’ budget for the increase.\n\nKit Beyer, communications director for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, said the March 27 claim relied on Evers’ own Department of Administration estimate of the tax impact. The DOA numbers did show the largest increase in a decade, but they didn’t detail what was behind the increase.\n\nA fiscal bureau report released April 9, 2019, showed the increase isn’t simply due to changes in the governor’s budget. It’s largely a result of current law — decisions made by local municipalities, voters and state government under Walker.\n\nIn fact, while some of Evers’ individual proposals would raise taxes, the overall budget would actually reduce the property tax level from what it would have been under current law alone. Fiscal bureau calculations say current law on its own would mean property taxes would go up by $72 on the median home in 2019-’20; under Evers’ budget the increase drops to $56.\n\nUnder current law, tax levies for school districts, technical colleges, municipalities and counties are expected to grow by 2 percent to 3 percent each in 2019-’20, according to the fiscal bureau. Some of those increases will be offset by new construction.The rest could affect the tax rate.\n\nMeanwhile, Evers’ budget would increase the property taxes districts are able to impose by $123 million in 2019-’20, but that would be offset by a $205 million increase in general school aids from the state. That would create a net drop in school-related taxes.\n\nMelissa Baldauff, a spokeswoman for Evers, also noted some factors that significantly impact the property tax level are outside the governor’s control. Those include school district tax levies implemented under current law and an unprecedented level of school spending approved by referendum, such as for new building projects or expanding annual spending beyond the typical limits.\n\nIn 2018 alone, Wisconsin voters approved a record $2 billion in K-12 school spending statewide through referendums, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum.\n\nBeyer argued Evers deserves the blame for any increases under his budget plan.\n\n\"If he didn’t want (property taxes) to go up by this much, he could have taken actions to reduce it,\" she said in an email. \"As a comparison, over the last eight years, Governor Walker and the Legislature took numerous actions to keep property taxes low.\"\n\nRepublicans claimed in a tweet that Evers’ budget would increase Wisconsin property taxes by the largest amount in a decade.\n\nThe estimate they relied on does show the largest year-over-year increase since 2009-’10. But the increase is not solely a result of Evers’ budget. Rather, it is based, in part, on a host of decisions by voters in referendums, by local units of government and by Walker and Republican leaders in years past.\n\nIndeed, the overall impact of Evers’ budget is to help keep the increase in check.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Did you know?

{"query_id": 1.2980716204148244e+18, "query": "I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma. The criticism is entirely justified.What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction.", "target": "In a hyped press briefing the eve of the Republican National Convention, President Donald Trump falsely said that convalescent plasma had been “proven to reduce mortality by 35%,” even though the therapy has not yet been shown to be effective for COVID-19.\n\nFood and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn also mischaracterized the data, inaccurately saying that a relative mortality decrease of 35% between those given high- versus low-concentration plasma meant that administering plasma would save 35 out 100 people sickened with COVID-19. That’s not right, and exaggerates the observed effect.\n\nThe administration’s inaccurate and imprecise summary of the existing data on convalescent plasma occurred in a Sunday night press briefing that Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany billed as revealing “a major therapeutic breakthrough” for the coronavirus.\n\nThe press conference was held one day after Trump alleged, baselessly, that the “deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA” was making it hard for companies to test COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics in an effort to delay results until after the Nov. 3 election. There is no evidence for such a claim.\n\nConvalescent plasma, which dates back to the 1918 influenza pandemic, refers to isolating the liquid portion of blood from patients who have recovered from COVID-19, which may contain antibodies that could help sick patients better fight off the virus.\n\nIn announcing that the FDA was issuing an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 — a decision that days before, the New York Times reported had been put on hold after other federal health officials thought the data was too weak — Trump claimed that the therapy had “an incredible rate of success” and that a Mayo Clinic study had “proven” that it worked.\n\nIn fact, the FDA did not determine that convalescent plasma is “safe and very effective,” as few randomized controlled trials exist, making its true efficacy unknown. Instead, the agency decided that the totality of the evidence supports the idea that plasma “may be effective in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19,” and that it is reasonable to think that the potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks.\n\nThose risks include “allergic reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, and transfusion associated lung injury, as well as the potential for transfusion-transmitted infections,” the FDA said in a press release announcing the EUA.\n\nThe FDA’s clinical memorandum emphasizes that additional research is still needed, writing, “Adequate and well-controlled randomized trials remain necessary for a definitive demonstration of [COVID-19 convalescent plasma] efficacy and to determine the optimal product attributes and appropriate patient populations for its use.”\n\nThe memo further explains that there are public results for only two randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 — one in Wuhan, China, and another in the Netherlands. Neither identified a statistically significant clinical improvement, although both trials were small and terminated early, and therefore may have missed the opportunity to detect a meaningful clinical benefit.\n\nPreviously, patients could obtain convalescent plasma through one of three pathways, including the expanded access program, which is what led to the Mayo Clinic study. Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, told us that with the EUA, hospitalized patients can now receive plasma outside of those programs — “just like any other prescription drug, so long as it is provided within the terms of the EUA.”\n\nInitially in the briefing, Hahn was more circumspect in his description of the data on convalescent plasma, saying that agency scientists concluded that “COVID-19 convalescent plasma is safe and shows promising efficacy.”\n\nBut in explaining the Mayo Clinic results, he neglected to mention that the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was not a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment to a placebo — and that the so-called 35% mortality benefit was in a subset of patients, comparing those who received plasma with a high concentration of antibodies to those who received a low concentration.\n\n“In the optimal treatment — the optimal patients … treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers,” Hahn said, referring to the concentration of antibodies in the plasma, “there was a 35% improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit.”\n\nHe then proceeded to incorrectly cast the finding as an absolute mortality benefit.\n\n“So let me just put this in perspective. Many of you know I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner, and a 35% improvement in survival is a pretty substantial clinical benefit,” Hahn continued. “What that means is — and if the data continue to pan out — 100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.”\n\nWhen pressed by a reporter and asked directly whether he was saying convalescent plasma was a promising treatment or had been shown to be effective, Hahn dodged the question — and let the misleading interpretation of the study stand.\n\n“So I would say that a 35 — if you’re one of those 35 out of 100 people who these data suggest or show survive as a result of it,” he said, “this is pretty significant for that person and their family.”\n\nAs we’ll explain, the 35% figure is a relative number, reflecting how much better patients who were given high titer plasma fared compared with those given low titer plasma. It does not mean that if the results hold that 35 people out of 100 would be saved by plasma. That would be an absolute mortality benefit, or the proportion of patients who avoid death because of the therapy.\n\nIn this case, the study did not test plasma against a placebo, so it cannot provide that information, although the absolute mortality reduction of giving concentrated plasma rather than low-concentration plasma, at least as reported in the preprint, is just 4.8% — meaning that fewer than five extra patients in 100 would survive as a result.\n\nBut even more critically, that particular result was drawn from a subset of participants and does not come from a randomized controlled trial, so it’s not definitive — and doesn’t settle the question of whether convalescent plasma is effective for COVID-19.\n\nHahn has since apologized for his flawed description of the Mayo Clinic results.\n\n“I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma,” he said in an Aug. 24 tweet. “The criticism is entirely justified. What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction.”\n\nAnd in an Aug. 25 interview on “CBS This Morning,” Hahn said, “I personally could have done a better job and should have done a better job at that press conference explaining what the data show regarding convalescent plasma.”\n\nThe Mayo Clinic study reports the results of more than 35,000 patients in the U.S.’s Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma. Rather than assigning people to either receive plasma or not, as would happen in a randomized placebo-controlled trial, the investigators followed the outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were given plasma at nearly 2,000 sites across the country.\n\nTo get a sense of whether the treatment worked, researchers then analyzed the data to see whether patients were less likely to die if they received the plasma earlier in their disease course, or, in a subset of patients for whom their plasma was evaluated for antibodies, whether those who got plasma that was rich in antibodies survived better than those who received less concentrated plasma.\n\nOverall, the data point to convalescent plasma being beneficial for COVID-19. According to the preprint, 8.7% of patients who received plasma within three days of diagnosis died within seven days, versus 11.9% of those who got it after four days or more. Similarly, the seven-day mortality rate was 8.9% for those who received the most concentrated plasma, compared with 13.7% for those who received the least concentrated plasma. That’s an absolute risk reduction of 4.8% and a 35% reduction in the relative mortality.\n\nStill, as a Johns Hopkins University review notes, because of the study design, it’s not possible to tell from this work whether or not convalescent plasma is effective for COVID-19.\n\n“[T]he cause of these differences in mortality may not be due to plasma therapy as the patients treated changed over time – were younger, healthier, less likely to have complications, and more likely to receive remdesivir later in the study – and the titer of antibodies transfused increased and the time to treatment also decreased over time,” the review reads. “This study highlights the need for randomized controlled studies to determine if there is a benefit for convalescent plasma for COVID-19.”\n\nTrump and Hahn have emphasized the 35% mortality reduction from the Mayo Clinic study, but it’s worth noting that it’s based on a subset of patients. And it’s not even entirely clear which data produced the statistic.\n\nAs noted above, there is a 35% crude relative mortality reduction reported in the preprint at seven days for those who received high-concentration plasma versus low-concentration plasma. This number is based on 1,076 patients who received plasma that had been measured for antibody titers and met the cutoff parameters (see table 1).\n\nBut the preprint also shows a 35% relative decrease in mortality for high versus low concentration plasma at day seven when adjusted for potential confounding factors using a pooled relative risk estimate. That number is based on a total of 1,058 patients, approximately a third of whom were on a ventilator and a fifth of whom had “many” severe risk factors (see figure 3).\n\nPreviously, however, the FDA told the New York Times that the 35% statistic was based on other data from the Mayo Clinic study that the agency included in its EUA application — specifically a survival graph at 30 days for a subset of fewer than 1,300 patients who were younger than 80, were not on a ventilator and had received plasma within three days (see figure 3 on page 12).\n\nAlthough the 35% is never written anywhere in the EUA application — and cannot be directly calculated because no exact numbers are provided — the Times estimated a 76% survival probability for patients receiving high-concentration plasma and a 63% survival probability for patients receiving low-concentration plasma from the graph, which works out to a 35% relative decrease in mortality.\n\nNotably, Dr. Arturo Casadevall of Johns Hopkins University, who was one of the senior authors of the Mayo Clinic study, told the New York Times that he didn’t know where the 35% came from.\n\nWhen we asked the FDA which specific data were used to make the 35% claim, the agency pointed us to Hahn’s “CBS This Morning” interview and promised to provide further information “when it is available.” We will update the story if we hear back. At this point, however, it remains unclear which information was used to generate the administration’s primary talking point.\n\nRegardless of the exact source, Hahn’s presentation of a 35% absolute mortality reduction, rather than a relative one, is incorrect.\n\nWhile this might seem to be a small error, Dr. David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, told us that it wasn’t.\n\n“THIS IS A HUGE MISTAKE which is very basic,” he said in an email. “I want to give Dr. Steve Hahn the benefit of the doubt that he was speaking extemporaneously and flubbed something,” he added, but the difference in this case is “huge.”\n\nIndeed, if it is based on the preprint figure, that would mean Hahn exaggerated the effect of convalescent plasma sevenfold.\n\nBoulware said he suspected that compared to no plasma, patients getting convalescent plasma probably are better off — but this remains an unanswered question. So are other critical questions, such as which patients benefit, which is especially important to know in deciding how to allocate a limited supply.\n\nThe Expanded Access Program, Boulware said, “was meant to be a short term bridge back in April. Yet tens of thousands of patients later, we don’t know what the benefit of plasma is.”\n\nAs for the EUA, Boulware said it “may” be warranted, but the hype beforehand was not — and that Hahn’s portrayal of a 35% absolute reduction in mortality was “deceptively misleading.”\n\nWhile the administration claims the EUA will expand access of convalescent plasma, Boulware said it changes little other than the paperwork. “Plasma remains a scarce resource,” he said. “We use all the plasma locally that is available.”\n\nMore worryingly, Boulware thinks the EUA will make completing the necessary clinical trials more difficult to do. “People will want plasma which ‘saves 35% of people’s lives,’” he said, “and not enroll in randomized trials” in which patients may not be assigned to get the treatment.\n\nFor his part, Casadevall, a senior author of the Mayo Clinic study, supports the EUA and believes it will help improve COVID-19 health inequities.\n\n“Plasma was already available in well resourced hospitals but understaffed hospitals caring for [underserved] populations struggled with the paperwork under the prior regs,” he said in an Aug. 24 tweet. “EUA makes usage easier.”\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the previous FDA commissioner under Trump, didn’t doubt that the EUA decision was science-based, but echoed the call for randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma.\n\n“Plasma may provide a benefit, and it could be meaningful for certain patients, but we need more evidence to prove it,” he said in a tweet. “The data FDA had supports an authorization for emergency use, where the standard is ‘may be effective’ but we need better studies to confirm preliminary findings.”\n\nAfter reviewing the published and unpublished evidence that underpinned the FDA’s EUA decision, the National Institute of Health’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued a statement on Sept. 1 emphasizing the lack of available evidence on convalescent plasma.\n\n“There are currently no data from well-controlled, adequately powered randomized clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19,” the statement reads, adding that the FDA’s analysis of a subset of patients from the Mayo Clinic found no overall benefit in survival at seven days among those given high- versus low-concentration plasma.\n\nRather, an effect was found only in patients who were not intubated, with 11% of patients given high-concentration plasma dying within a week compared with 14% of patients given low-concentration plasma — a 21% decrease in relative mortality.\n\n“Although these data suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody titers may be beneficial in nonintubated patients, uncertainty remains about the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma due to the lack of a randomized control group and possible confounding,” the statement said. “Additionally, antibody levels in currently available COVID-19 convalescent plasma are highly variable, and assays to determine the effective antibody titers remain limited.”\n\nThe panel concluded that for now, there are “insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19.”\n\nUpdate, Aug. 27: We added more information about how the EUA for COVID-19 convalescent plasma changes how patients can access the therapy.\n\nUpdate, Sept. 3: We added the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s statement about the FDA’s EUA for convalescent plasma.\n\nEditor’s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.

Among other points of criticism was his repeated insistence on referring to the disease as the “Chinese virus,” despite widely-accepted public health authority guidelines that warn against naming disease outbreaks after nations or regions of the world, due to the unfounded stigmatization such names can cause.\n\nThe president used that name again during a White House briefing on March 19. Afterwards, social media users shared a photograph purportedly taken at the event, which appeared to show that Trump was even ignoring the guidance of his aides in insisting on referring to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus.” Washington Post photographer Jabin Botsford tweeted the following:\n\nThose images were authentic. The original, official photograph was taken by Botsford himself and published by the Getty Images agency on March 19. The website described the image as follows:\n\n“A close up of President Donald J.

Until these young people’s futures are secure, I cannot support it.", "target": "Army soldiers participating in a live-fire exercise in Oklahoma last month. Military spending has decreased in recent years.\n\nWASHINGTON — As President Trump prepared on Friday to sign a $1.3 trillion spending bill, just hours after threatening to veto it, he offered a few misleading and selectively worded claims to explain why he was reluctantly authorizing the legislation. “We looked at the veto. I looked very seriously at the veto. I was thinking about doing the veto,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “But because of the incredible gains that we’ve been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our — any of our thinking.” But his explanation did not accurately describe just why those gains were enough to ultimately approve the spending bill. Nor did it correctly demonstrate why the legislation did not include programs that he had prioritized. Here’s a fact-check.\n\nMore important, military pay increases are, by law, tied to the employment cost index, which measures private-sector wages — although the president or Congress can ask for more or less. The Pentagon requested, and Congress enacted, pay increases smaller than the index’s growth rate from 2014 through 2016. But both before and after that time — from 2011 to 2013 and 2017 to 2018 — pay for troops rose at the exact rate as the index grew. Mr. Trump’s proposed budgets for 2017 and 2018 had requested pay increases of 1.6 percent and 2.1 percent — rates that were lower than the statutory formula, and that were ultimately ignored by Congress. “For the last eight years, deep defense cuts have undermined our national security. If you look at what’s taken out, they’ve hallowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk.” Mr. Trump accurately noted that military officials had expressed concern about degraded troop readiness and delayed modernization of supplies. Both are what officials have described as consequences of protracted combat and budget restrictions, known as sequestration, that were imposed by Congress.\n\nIt’s worth noting that military spending has decreased in recent years, after the United States withdrew combat troops from Iraq in 2011. Adjusted for inflation, total military spending swelled to more than $774 billion in the 2010 fiscal year from roughly $400 billion in the 2000 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That period was the peak of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the wars wound down, so did military spending, which declined to $583 billion by the 2017 fiscal year. War-related spending aside, the Pentagon base budget alone was still larger in 2017 than it was in 2007 or 1997. Over all, the United States spends more on its military than the next seven countries combined. “I can tell you this, and I say this to DACA recipients that the Republicans are with you. They want to get your situation taken care of. The Democrats fought us. They just fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill.” In September, Mr. Trump moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program began by President Barack Obama that shielded eligible young undocumented immigrants from deportation and gave them the right to work. It is highly misleading to suggest that Democrats “fought” efforts to solidify the program into law. Democratic leaders have rejected Mr. Trump’s demand to pair the program with funding for a border wall, but that is not nearly the same as not wanting a legislative solution at all. Democrats met with Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers in January to discuss a deal, during which Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, suggested a “clean DACA bill.” At the meeting, Mr. Trump agreed.", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that request."}

But Hanson’s number was correct at the time of her statement, and the revision doesn’t change the outcome of this FactCheck.\n\nIn terms of the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Luxembourg was the fastest-growing country in 2016, with Australia coming in fifth.\n\nCaution must be used when making international population comparisons. It’s important to put the growth rates in the context of the total size, density and demographic makeup of the population, and the economic stage of the country.\n\nHow do we calculate population growth?\n\nA country’s population growth, or decline, is determined by the change in the estimated number of residents. Those changes include the number of births and deaths (known as natural increase), and net overseas migration.\n\nIn Australia, both temporary and permanent overseas migrants are included in the calculation of population size.\n\nAccording to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, Australia’s population grew by 1.6% in the year to June 2017 – as Hanson said.\n\nSince Hanson’s statement, Australia’s population growth rate for the period ending June 2017 has been revised upwards to 1.7%. But, as said in the verdict, Hanson’s number was correct at the time of her statement, and the revision doesn’t change any of the other outcomes of this FactCheck.\n\nThat’s an increase of 407,000 people in a population of 24.6 million.\n\nAll states and territories recorded positive population growth in the year to June 2017. Victoria had the fastest growth rate (2.4%) and South Australia recorded the slowest growth rate (0.6%).\n\nRead more: FactCheck: is South Australia's youth population rising or falling?\n\nIs Australia’s population the ‘highest-growing in the world’?\n\nThere are different ways of reporting population data.\n\nPopulation projections are statements about future populations based on certain assumptions regarding the future of births, deaths and migration.\n\nPopulation estimates are statistics based on data from a population for a previous time period. Population estimates provide a more accurate representation of actual dynamics.\n\nWorld Bank data for 2016 (based on population estimates) provide us with the most accurate international comparison.\n\nAccording to those data, Australia’s growth rate – 1.5% for 2016 – placed it at 86th in the world. The top 10 countries grew by between 3% and 5%.\n\nHow does Australia’s growth compare to other OECD countries?\n\nComparison of Australia’s average annual population growth with other OECD countries shows Australia’s rate of population growth is among the highest in the OECD, but not the highest.\n\nThis is true whether we look at annual averages for five-year bands between 1990 and 2015, or single-year data.\n\nLooking again at the World Bank data, Australia’s rate of population growth for 2016, at 1.5%, was double that of many other OECD countries, including the United Kingdom (0.7%) and United States (0.7%).\n\nHanson has proposed a national vote on what she describes as Australia’s “runaway rates of immigration”.\n\nThe senator has suggested reducing Australia’s Migration Program cap from the current level of 190,000 people per year to 75,000-100,000 people per year. The expected intake of 190,000 permanent migrants was not met over the last few years. Permanent migration for 2017-18 has dropped to 162,400 people, due to changes in vetting processes.\n\nThe greatest contribution to the growth of the Australian population (63%) comes from overseas migration, as Hanson’s office noted in their response to The Conversation.\n\nThe origin countries of migrants are becoming more diverse, posing socioeconomic benefits and infrastructure challenges for Australia.\n\nSometimes people confuse net overseas migration (the total of all people moving in and out of Australia in a certain time frame), with permanent migration (the number of people who come to Australia to live). They are not the same thing.\n\nNet overseas migration includes temporary migration. And net overseas migration is included in population data. This means our population growth reflects our permanent population, plus more.\n\nTemporary migrants are a major contributor to population growth in Australia – in particular, international students.\n\nIn the most recent data (2014-15), net temporary migrants numbered just under 132,000, a figure that included just over 77,000 net temporary students.\n\nPopulation changes track the history of the nation. This includes events like post-war rebuilding – including the baby boom and resettlement of displaced European nationals – to subsequent fluctuations in birth rates and net overseas migration.\n\nWe can see these events reflected in the rates of growth from 1945 to the present.\n\nThe rate of population growth in Australia increased markedly in 2007, before peaking at 2.1% in 2009 (after the height of the global financial crisis, in which the Australian economy fared better than many others).\n\nSince 2009, annual population growth has bounced around between a low of 1.4% and a high of 1.8%.\n\nThe longer-term average for population growth rates since 1947 is 1.6% (the same as it is now).\n\nIt’s worth remembering that a higher annual growth rate coming from a lower population base is usually still lower growth in terms of actual numbers of people, when compared to a lower growth rate on a higher population base.\n\nThere can also be significant fluctuations in population growth rates from year to year. So we need to use caution when making assessments based on changes in annual rates.\n\nEconomic factors, government policies, and special events are just some of the things that can influence year-on-year population movements.\n\nOther factors we should consider when making international comparisons include the:\n• demographic composition, or age distribution, of the population\n• economic stage of the country (for example, post-industrialisation or otherwise).\n\nAny changes to the Migration Program should be considered alongside the best available research. – Liz Allen\n\nThe FactCheck is fair and correct.\n\nThe statement about Australia’s population growth rate over the year to June 30 2017 is correct. The preliminary growth rate published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics at the time of Hanson’s statement was 1.60%; the rate was subsequently revised to 1.68%.\n\nIt is also true that many developed countries have lower population growth rates than Australia, but some have higher rates. According to United Nations Population Division estimates, Oman had the fastest-growing population between 2014 and 2015 (the latest data available).\n\nWith regard to misinterpretations of net overseas migration, it should also be stated that some people think this refers to the number of people migrating to Australia. It is actually immigration minus emigration – the difference between the number arriving and the number leaving. – Tom Wilson\n\nThe Conversation’s FactCheck unit was the first fact-checking team in Australia and one of the first worldwide to be accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network, an alliance of fact-checkers hosted at the Poynter Institute in the US.

The purported ad showcases a body bag manufactured by the Italian luxury fashion brand “Prada”.\n\nThe 1.25-minute film shows a woman’s body being carried away in a body bag with a “Prada” logo on it. The woman had died after accidentally falling off a staircase. The tagline of the video says, “Prada Body Bag It’s the last bag you’ll ever need”.\n\nWhile some have found the ad cringe-worthy in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, others are just amused. Many have taken to social media claiming that “Prada” is now making bags for corpses.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is actually a spoof. The video was made four years back by a group of American comedians calling themselves “The Kloons”. Neither has “Prada” made the ad, nor is it manufacturing body bags.\n\nThe video, which has been shot like an ad campaign, is circulating on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

One of them said that Emirates is giving out free tickets as a celebration of their 33rd anniversary and another saying, \"Free tickets to celebrate their 80th anniversary\".\n\nEmirates was founded in the year 1985, according to their official website .\n\nThough the airline is now 33-years old, there is no reason for the airline to offer you free tickets on its '80th year of success'.\n\nEither ways, the airline has put out a clarification on Twitter saying that the particular promotion is a hoax and that it has nothing to do with Emirates.\n\nSpeaking to The Khaleej Times, a spokesperson for Emirates had this to say:\n\nBut Emirates is not the only airline to face this fraud. Low-cost carrier AirAsia had warned its customers in May 2017 when a hoax about free tickets offered by the airlines went viral on social media.\n\nChannel News Asia reported that AirAsia informed its customers that \"the scam requires participants to answer several questions to redeem vouchers\" and said it would not be held liable for any claims pertaining to the false scheme.\n\nIn the case of AirAsia, it is not very difficult to understand why fraudsters get away by cheating people online. The low-cost carrier have mastered the art of running promotions through the year for prices as low as double digits. A Google search will reveal that the airline is currently running a new promotion that offers flight tickets to seven cities in the country at a base fare of Rs 99 (taxes and other charges extra). Enough to blur the line between low-priced tickets and free tickets when fake offers go online.\n\nLooks like for AirAsia, free ticket scams run by frauds are not the only headache. A day earlier, the airline clarified that potential job-seekers should not engage with recruitment agents who promise jobs with AirAsia. The airline said that it has its own human resource department and do not outsource its recruitment to outside agencies.\n\nBut how do scamsters benefit from such viral messages on social media. And what happens when you click on such links? The world's oldest and the largest fact checking website Snopes.com reported in February 2016 on several viral promotions on social media that claim to give away free tickets or spending money on Facebook users who share and like a page. Snopes called them a form of online scam.\n\nSnopes has warned that clicking on such links will not just force you to reveal a lot of personal information that could be used against you but could also make you a victim of 'lifejacking'. This would mean a malicious script takes over a user's Facebook profile without their knowledge and propagates itself to their friends' accounts as well, reports Snopes.com.\n\nBOOM contacted Jet Airways who said they haven't found any instances of their brand being misused in such free ticket offer scams. But they said that all their promotional offers are run through their official website, verified social media handles and authorised travel agents.\n\nEither ways, there are no free lunches and if it sounds too good to be true, maybe it is time to ignore the urge to click.\n\nBut if it is too tempting, do it at your own risk, warn airline companies.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Hi Mohammed, this is just another hoax unrelated to Emirates.

Here’s what I was referring to. #facts", "target": "At the Washington, D.C., premiere of a new movie by conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, Donald Trump Jr. gave an on-camera interview to One America News Network, a conservative outlet.\n\nIn it, the younger Trump echoed one of D’Souza’s themes that Democrats are a crypto-Nazi party.\n\n\"You see the Nazi platform from the early 1930s ... look at it compared to the DNC (Democratic Party) platform of today, you're saying, 'Man, those things are awfully similar' to a point where it's actually scary. It's the exact opposite of what you’ve been told.\" (The Aug. 1 interview can be seen on video here, around the 3:20 mark.)\n\nThe assertion appears to originate with D’Souza’s 2017 book, The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left. In one passage, he cites a 25-point program that included nationalization of large corporations, government control of banking, the expropriation of land, a broader pension system, and universal free health care and education.\n\nIf you read the Nazi platform without knowing its source, you could easily be forgiven for thinking you were reading the 2016 platform of the Democratic Party. Or a least a Democratic platform drafted jointly by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Sure, some of the language is out of date. The Democrats don’t talk about \"usury\" these days; they’d have to substitute \"Wall Street Greed.\" But otherwise, it’s all there. All you have to do is cross out the word \"Nazi\" and write in the word \"Democrat.\"\n\nD’Souza did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but Trump Jr. sent a tweet on Aug. 2 that said, \"So the left spends the last 3 years falsely calling my entire family NAZI’s, but the second I point out the similarities between the economic platform of the National Socialists and the Democrat Party, they scream bloody murder. Here’s what I was referring to. #facts.\" The tweet linked to a teaser clip from D'Souza's film that covers much the same ground as the excerpt above.\n\nWe dug out the original Nazi platform from 1920 and consulted with historians of the period. There was wide agreement that D’Souza has made a dubious and overly simplified comparison of the Nazis and the Democrats while also overlooking large portions of the platform that couldn’t be further from present-day Democratic orthodoxy.\n\n\"There is not the slightest, tiny sliver in which this could be even somewhat accurate,\" said Jeffrey Herf, a University of Maryland historian and author of The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda during World War II and the Holocaust. Herf is a self-described critic of President Barack Obama, yet he said he can say confidently \"that the Democrats have nothing in common with the Nazi Party.\"\n\nWhat did the Nazis run on?\n\nIn 1919, Adolf Hitler joined what was then the tiny German Workers' Party and began to convert it to his renamed National Socialist German Workers' Party, said Richard Breitman, an American University historian and author of The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution. Hitler became a co-author of the party’s program of 1920. (At that point, Germany had democratic elections.)\n\nThe document is important, historians said, but it also requires a caveat.\n\n\"It did not reflect all of Hitler’s views — it was a compromise,\" Breitman said. Some items — indeed, many of those that D’Souza says echo contemporary Democratic Party planks — are socialist. But even some of these are overlain with nationalist ideas more in tune with Hitler’s thinking, and overall, a majority of the planks articulate an extreme form of racial nationalism that is absent from modern-day Democratic platforms.\n\nThe economic elements D'Souza emphasized need important context, said Laurie Marhoefer, a historian at the University of Washington who has studied the period.\n\n\"The socialist elements in national socialism are in service to the racism,\" she said. \"That's very different from socialism itself, from social democracy, and from the Democrats in the United States, who aren't even social democrats.\"\n\nSome points that may sound similar\n\nWe found only three points in the 1920 Nazi platform that could be described as clearly similar to points made in the 2016 Democratic Party platform.\n• \"We demand the extensive development of insurance for old age.\"\n• Support for \"the aim of opening up to every able and hard-working German the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement. ... We demand the education of gifted children of poor parents, whatever their class or occupation, at the expense of the state.\"\n• \"The state must ensure that the nation’s health standards are raised.\"\n\nHowever, these goals are so anodyne that not only the Democratic platform but also the Republican platform in 2016 mentioned them.\n\nIn three other cases, it’s possible to cherry-pick language from the Nazi platform that echoes Democratic Party principles of equality, prosperity and freedom, but a closer look reveals important differences.\n• \"All citizens shall have equal rights and duties.\" This sounds inoffensive, but elsewhere in the Nazi document, it offers an exclusionary definition of \"citizens\" — specifically, that \"only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation.\"\n• \"We demand the creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class.\" This may sound like American political boilerplate, but the next clause defines the pathway to this goal as \"the immediate communalizing of big department stores, and their lease at a cheap rate to small traders.\" There’s nothing in the Democratic platform about expropriating department stores for the benefit of small-business owners.\n• \"We demand freedom for all religious denominations in the state.\" This sounds fine, but the sentence goes on to clarify, \"provided they do not threaten its existence nor offend the moral feelings of the German race.\"\n\nD’Souza ignores many Nazi planks that are antithetical to Democratic Party policies\n\nThe majority of points in the platform address issues that cannot be found in the Democratic Party platform.\n• Colonization. \"We demand land and territory (colonies) to feed our people and to settle our surplus population,\" the Nazi platform said.\n• Immigration restrictions and deportations. The document says, \"If it should prove impossible to feed the entire population, foreign nationals (non-citizens) must be deported from the Reich.\" In addition, \"all non-German immigration must be prevented.\" The 2016 Democratic platform, by contrast, says the party \"supports legal immigration\" and would maintain ‘the United States’ role as a beacon of hope for people seeking safety, freedom, and security.\"\n• The death penalty. The Nazi platform said that \"common criminals, usurers, profiteers, etc., must be punished with death, whatever their creed or race.\" But the Democratic platform calls for abolishing the death penalty.\n• Nationalization of the economy and expropriation of assets. While some may suggest that Democrats’ preference for progressive taxation and regulation of the free market are tantamount to socialism, the elements of the Nazi platform derived from the socialist side of its roots are more far-reaching than elements of the Democratic platform. For instance, the Nazi document advocates \"the abolition of incomes unearned by work,\" \"the ruthless confiscation of all war profits,\" \"the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations,\" and \"expropriation of land for communal purposes without compensation, the abolition of ground rent, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.\"\n• Restrictions on the press. The Nazi document said that ‘the publishing of papers which are not conducive to the national welfare must be forbidden\" and added that \"non-Germans shall be prohibited by law from participating financially in or influencing German newspapers,\" punishable by \"immediate deportation.\" Nothing like this appears in the Democratic platform.\n• Racial purity. The roots of the Holocaust can be detected in the 1920 Nazi platform. \"Only members of the nation may be citizens of the state. Only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation.\" It goes on to say that the party \"combats the Jewish-materialist spirit within and without us.\"\n\nThis element offers the starkest difference, experts said.\n\n\"There is nothing in the Democratic Platform that resembles the central point of the Nazi movement — that ‘no Jew may be a member of the nation,’\" said Peter Hayes, a Northwestern University professor of history and German and author of Why?: Explaining the Holocaust.\n\nAnd as harsh as some of its rhetoric is, the 1920 document actually underplays what Nazism eventually became.\n\n\"Because Hitler wanted to create the image of consistency and infallibility, he never changed the program after he became Fuehrer of the party,\" Breitman said. \"He just continued to radicalize his views. When he gained power in 1933, he exploited opportunities to seize dictatorial control and then worked to expand party-state control of all aspects of life.\"\n\nTrump Jr. said, \"You see the Nazi platform from the early 1930s ... look at it compared to the (Democratic Party) platform of today, you're saying, 'Man, those things are awfully similar,' to a point where it's actually scary.\"\n\nOnly a small number of elements of the two platforms are clearly similar, and those are so uncontroversial that they appear in the Republican platform as well. The vast majority of planks in the Nazi platform not only don’t appear in the Democratic platform, but are wholly antithetical to it.

{"query_id": 1.2089778219865047e+18, "query": "Modi: NRC? What’s that? Why are Urban Naxals scaring you about NRC? We never said anything about all-India NRC.", "target": "The BJP’s election campaign for the upcoming polls in Delhi was kicked off with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address at Ramlila Maidan on December 22. Here, among other things, the PM spoke extensively about the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens and the ongoing protests against CAA-NRC.\n\nHowever, amidst the attacks on the opposition, blaming protesters for the ensuing violence and the assertion that citizens are being misled on the legislation, Alt News found the Prime Minister’s speech replete with falsehood, amplified half-truths and imaginary claims.\n\nCLAIM 1: CAB was passed in Parliament for the benefit of everybody, the Dalits and oppressed.\n\nAt about 25 minutes into his speech, PM Modi said, “India’s Parliament, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, helped passed the [Citizenship Amendment] Bill for your bright future, for the future of Dalits, the oppressed and the exploited. You all stand up and pay respect to the country’s Parliament, its Lok Sabha, its Rajya Sabha, the MPs you selected. Pay respect with all your might, friends.”\n\nThis statement was the easiest to debunk, thanks to the Prime Minister himself.\n\nWhile addressing the crowd, PM Modi said that CAB was passed for “your” benefit, thus suggesting that it has a far-reaching impact. The Prime Minister stated that the law will benefit a wide range of Indian population including Dalits and oppressed citizens. However, about 20 minutes later he contradicted his own assertion by saying the law has nothing to do with any Indian citizen.\n\nAt about 48:45 minutes into the address, he said, “Citizenship Amendment legislation is not for any citizen – Hindu or Muslim. This was said in Parliament and false statements are not allowed in the Parliament. This law has nothing to do with the 130 crore people who stay in this country.”\n\nThe part where PM Modi makes the above remarks can be watched below.\n\nCLAIM 2: BJP government has not discussed NRC since 2014.\n\nAt about 51:45 minutes, PM Modi said, “After my government came into power, since 2014 till today, I want to tell the 130 crore countrymen that NRC word has not been discussed anywhere. We had to implement it in Assam only under the Supreme Court’s direction.”\n\nThe National Register of Citizens or NRC has been referred by members of the ruling party, including the Prime Minister, umpteen number of times.\n\nNRC was a part of the BJP’s election manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.\n\n“There has been a huge change in the cultural and linguistic identity of some areas due to illegal immigration, resulting in an adverse impact on local people’s livelihood and employment. We will expeditiously complete the National Register of Citizens process in these areas on priority. In future we will implement the NRC in a phased manner in other parts of the country,” reads a section on the 11th page of the manifesto under the sub-heading ‘Combating Infiltration’.\n\nNRC has also been brought up in the Parliament, contrary to PM Modi’s claim. Addressing the Rajya Sabha on November 20, Home Minister Amit Shah promised the House that NRC would be carried out pan-India.\n\nThe Home Minister had, in fact, said that nationwide NRC would be conducted before 2024 polls.\n\nFurthermore, PM Modi’s attempt to portray certain helplessness with Assam NRC – “had to implement it under the Supreme Court’s direction” – is misleading and refuted by the party’s 2019 election manifesto where it appears as one of the many promises.\n\nThe claim that India has no detention centres was repeated by the Prime Minister multiple times in his speech, approximately 52 minutes onward. He blamed Congress and ‘urban naxals’ for propagating the so-called lie that the country has detention camps.\n\nOn November 27 in the Rajya Sabha, TMC MP Santanu Sen questioned the Home Ministry on the number of detention centres in Assam and the number of detainees held in these facilities. Minister of State of Home Affairs Nityanand Rai said in a written reply, “As informed by the state Government of Assam, as on 22.11.2019, 988 foreigners were lodged in 06(six) Detention Centres in Assam.”\n\nAnother detention centre is being constructed in Assam which is to become the largest in the country. Attached below is a screenshot of the website of Assam government.\n\nFurthermore, there are reports of detention centres under construction in Maharashtra and West Bengal. A detention centre in Bangalore, Karnataka is getting finishing touches.\n\nCLAIM 4: Congress and ‘urban naxals’ have claimed that all Muslims would be sent to detention centres.\n\nIn the above-mentioned statement, the Prime Minister has attributed an imaginary claim to those who are opposed to CAA, then declared them as propagating falsehood.\n\nCongress never claimed that all Muslims would be sent to detention centres. A December 22 tweet by the party clearly states, “an Indian citizen without the requisite documents will be forced to suffer the ordeal of several court cases & may eventually end up in a detention camp.”\n\nIn fact, Congress has maintained throughout that CAA is discriminatory and did not suggest that every Muslim person would be sent to detention camps. Senior leader of the party Shashi Tharoor submitted a notice in the Lok Sabha opposing the Bill and said, “The bill endorses the idea of religious discrimination by allowing individuals of only six religious identities to acquire citizenship while excluding the individuals belonging to other religious identities.”\n\nProminent opposition leaders have also not stated that all Muslims would be sent to detention centres. CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury wrote in a tweet, “It will be life in detention camps for so many, especially poor & marginalised sections.”\n\nThe Prime Minister also used the term “urban Naxals” and claimed that this class of people made similar assertions. Alt News is unable to fact-check this part as we are unsure what the term means and who qualifies to be an “urban naxal”.\n\nCLAIM 5: Anti-CAA protestors responsible for violence against the poor and destruction of public property. Police are victims of violence.\n\nNearly half-way into his speech, PM Modi made an impassioned request to anti-CAA protesters. “Take out all your anger on me. What will you get by beating poor auto drivers?”\n\nHe then goes on to say that the protesters are injuring policemen in stone-pelting. PM Modi terms the police “hinsa ka shikaar (victims of violence)” and states the number of cops who’ve been martyred since independence.\n\nThis too is a half-truth and a case of convenient omissions. While there have been reports, photographs, and videos of policemen injured in the violence during anti-CAA protests, the Prime Minister completely disregarded the mounting evidence of police excesses revealed via media reports and citizen videos and imagery.\n\nThe anti-CAA protests have occurred pan-India which includes both BJP states and non-BJP states. The protests that have happened in non-BJP states have witnessed little violence. Despite the protestors coming out in thousands, the agitation has remained predominately peaceful in these regions, However, in BJP states, there has been a blanket imposition of Section 144 disallowing protests. The violence in states ruled by BJP governments has accounted for 25 deaths, with Uttar Pradesh alone accounting for 18 deaths, Assam 5 and Karnataka 2. At least four deaths in Assam and the two in Karnataka have been attributed to police firing. Karnataka High Court has questioned the state government regarding the blanket ban on protests.\n\nIt is noteworthy that there have been no reported deaths of police personnel.\n\nThus, the Prime Minister by selectively highlighting the injuries suffered by the police has chosen to give an incomplete picture of the situation on the ground. It is clear that states with non-BJP governments have handled the protests more efficiently than BJP ruled states, which further hints at issues of governance and policing.\n\nCLAIM 6: Manmohan Singh said in Parliament, “We should give citizenship to those facing religious persecution in Bangladesh and fleeing to India for refuge.”\n\nThe main lacunae pointed out by critics of CAA is its discriminatory nature wherein Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Jain, Parsi and Sikh immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh can apply for Indian citizenship, but Muslims cannot. BJP in the past and PM in the recent address cited a speech by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in defence of the law. However, the PM failed to mention that while Dr Singh did speak in favour of Citizenship Bill that accepts persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries, he did not single out any community based on religion.\n\nWhile discussing the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2003 in the Rajya Sabha, the ex-PM had said, “After the partition of our country, the minorities in countries like Bangladesh, have faced persecution, and it is our moral obligation that if circumstances force people, these unfortunate people, to seek refuge in our country, our approach to granting citizenship to these unfortunate persons should be more liberal.”\n\nHis speech incidentally tweeted by BJP can be watched below.\n\nDr Singh mentioned “the minorities in countries like Bangladesh” and does not single-out communities.\n\nA major portion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address at Ramlila Maidan, concerning NRC, CAA and the protests that followed, was contrary to facts. The PM made several false claims, half-truths, misleading assertions and statements that were plain imaginary.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Modi: NRC? What's that???

If you happen to see this flag on any Social Media Profile or someone using the term MAP in their bio, please REPORTthe Pedophile running that account.Do your bit.", "target": "A number of fear-mongering campaigns over the years have attempted to link pedophilia to the LGBTQ community, despite an utter lack of scientific proof of any such connection. In December 2017, for instance, internet trolls spread a false rumor that the letter “P,” representing “pedosexual,” was being added to the initialism LGBT (for “lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender”).\n\nAn eerily similar rumor was spread via social media in June 2018 in the form of an image purportedly showing a “MAPs (Minor-Attracted Persons) Pride Flag” supposedly created for Gay Pride Month:\n\nThis picture does not represent a “MAPs Pride Flag.” Rather, the image was created as part of a troll experiment on Tumblr.\n\nWhen pictures of this “MAP flag” began circulating on Facebook, the posts typically included messages warning other social media users to be wary of anyone displaying this flag:\n\nWebsites such as the Daily Caller and “Attitude” picked up on this alleged “MAPs Pride Flag” and reported that pedophiles were “rebranding” themselves as “Minor Attracted Persons” in an attempt to be accepted by the LGBT community:\n\nPaedophiles are trying to gain acceptance to the LGBT community by rebranding themselves. In a bid to gain acceptance, they have rebranded themselves as MAPs or “Minor Attracted Persons” and have gone so far to even create a rainbow “Pride” flag for Gay Pride, but Twitter user, Communist Fish, posted a picture back in June to warn children to stay away. The group attempt to claim that paedophiles are misunderstood people and if they do not act upon their attraction to children, they shouldn’t be marginalised. Sites like The Prevention Project have started to post testimonials from paedophiles who are seeking help with their attraction, claiming everyone “needs support”.\n\nPedophiles did not coin the term “minor attracted persons” (or MAPS) to rebrand themselves in 2018 in order to gain entry to the LGBT community. Organizations such as B4UAct have been using the term “minor attracted persons” for years to refer to “adults who experience feelings of preferential sexual attraction to children or adolescents under the age of consent.”\n\nThe Prevention Project, an organization that helps minor-attracted persons find professional treatment, explicitly denied that the term “MAPs” was an attempt to “rebrand” pedophiles. Rather, they explained that this term was preferred as a broader reference that could accurately encompass hebephiles, pedophiles, and ephebephiles:\n\nThe term minor is defined as anyone under the age of 18. Therefore, someone attracted to a 14 year old is actually called an ephebephile not a pedophile. Someone attracted to a 13 year old is called a hebephile. Pedophiles are attracted to 6-12 year old children; not teens. Hence why we accurately use the term “Minor Attracted Person” when we discuss providing treatment to men and women with attractions to various ages of minors. We are not trying to “soften the term” or “rebrand” pedophilia to fit in with certain groups. We treat individuals who are attracted to various ages of minors, thus it is accurate to use the term “minor attracted person.”\n\nWe also found no evidence that this flag originated in earnest as a MAPs Pride Flag. We reached out to the “Prevention Project, who told us they had never heard of this pride flag: “We’re experts in treating MAPs who have zero desire to harm anyone but want support to deal with the stigma of being a pedophile, hebophile or ephebephile. MAPs encompass these 3 terms. None of the MAPs we know (we know a lot) have talked about this [flag].”\n\nThis alleged “MAPs Pride Flag” appears to have originated on the Tumblr page “Don’t Mistake Our Geography” on 13 June 2018, where it was posted with a brief explanation about what the colors in the flag supposedly symbolized to NOMAPS (Non-Offending Minor Attracted Persons) and an acknowledgement that the “pride flag” had just been created out of whole cloth:\n\nThe NOMAP community doesn’t really have a pride flag, so in honor of pride month I designed a NOMAP pride flag. The top two stripes are blue to represent NOMAPs attracted to young boys. The bottom two stripes are pink to represent NOMAPs attracted to young girls. The inner stripes are yellow to represent childhood and general attraction to minors, regardless of their gender. The middle stripe is white to represent our innocence and unwillingness to offend. Please feel free to use this flag and make icons out of it etc! Hope you enjoy\n\nAt the time this Pride flag image was originally posted, the Tumblr page operated under a banner in support of MAPs and included a tagline claiming that the author was “possibly a MAP” and “definitely a supporter.” However, the title of this page was later changed to “Y’all need a therapist, not a community,” and the tagline was altered to read “Not an anti, not an ally, just a training psychologist with some fucking sense.”\n\nHere’s a look at how the page was changed. The top image shows the Tumblr page as it was in mid-June, while it was claiming to be a MAP ally; the bottom image shows the page at the time of this writing, after it was revealed that the flag was bogus:\n\nAlthough we don’t know the motivations of this Tumblr user, it should be noted that the person claimed to be a CSA (child sexual assault) victim.\n\nPedophiles are not rebranding themselves as MAPs to gain entry to the LGBT community, nor did they release an official “MAPs Pride Flag.” As we noted in our article about the homophobic and false rumor that a “P” for pedosexual was being added to the initialism LGBT, no link has been established between pedophilia and homosexuality:\n\nAn especially pernicious myth is that most adults who sexually abuse children are gay. A number of researchers have looked at this question to determine if homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexuals, and the data indicate that’s not the case. For example, in a 1989 study led by Kurt Freund of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Canada, scientists showed pictures of children to adult gay and straight males, and measured sexual arousal. Homosexual men reacted no more strongly to pictures of male children than heterosexual men reacted to pictures of female children. A 1994 study, led by Carole Jenny of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, surveyed 269 cases of children who were sexually molested by adults. In 82 percent of cases, the alleged offender was a heterosexual partner of a close relative of the child, the researchers reported in the journal Pediatrics. In only two out of 269 cases, the offender was identified as being gay or lesbian.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Warning! 🚨 This flag might be linked to Minor Attracted Persons (MAP).

A friend was sitting next to their table and heard JK blasting @realDonaldTrump. The Iranians had a 5 person security detail and left in diplomatic vehicles. Is he FARA registered?\" Jason Osborne tweeted, referring to the Foreign Agents Registration Act that requires Americans to disclose activities taken on behalf of foreign governments.\n\nThe allegation came on the heels of reports about Kerry’s unsuccessful 11th hour bid to preserve a deal he played an instrumental role in crafting, as Trump moved closer to fulfilling his campaign vow to shake up the pact.\n\nKerry was in Paris at the time. But his team vehemently denied any Paris meeting with Iranians took place\n\n\"That’s completely made up,\" David Wade, Kerry’s former chief of staff, tweeted May 12. \"Total fiction.\"\n\nWe looked into it. Here’s what we found: The claim rests on a former Trump adviser’s source who claimed to have eavesdropped on the conversation. However, we did not uncover definitive proof that a meeting went down.\n\nOsborne, a former adviser to the presidential campaigns of Trump and Ben Carson, told PolitiFact his purported source began listening midway through Kerry’s conversation.\n\n\"He had no idea who Kerry was meeting with but was annoyed about what he overheard so he started paying attention,\" Osborne said by email. \"Then he noticed the (diplomatic) cars and security when the folks left and realized they were Iranian.\"\n\nOsborne gave us a phone number for his source, so we called it. Multiple calls to the number were not returned.\n\nA day after Kerry’s alleged meeting, Osborne tweeted photos that he said depicted the three Iranians who met with Kerry, and asked Twitter users to help identify the men.\n\n\"Just got pictures of the 3 Iranians who met with John Kerry yesterday. They are entering their hotel the ‘Prince De Galles,’ \" Osborne tweeted May 13. \"Anyone know who they are?\"\n\nAn Iranian dissident named M.

Ahead of the U.S. withdrawal, Kerry, who was secretary of state under President Barack Obama, met with Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, courted European officials and made dozens of calls to members of Congress in hopes of salvaging the accord.\n\nTrump and right-wing backers challenged Kerry’s actions as violating the 18th century Logan Act, which prevents U.S. citizens from privately meeting with a foreign government to sway its decisions on matters involving the United States.\n\nLegal scholars consider the Logan Act a \"dead letter\" law — meaning that while it’s still technically on the books, it would be highly unlikely to be enforced.\n\nNonetheless, as the Trump administration learned after national security adviser Michael Flynn was accused of violating the Logan Act for appearing to undermine Obama-era sanctions against Russia, the law still has political resonance.\n\nBut Wade, Kerry’s former chief of staff, said the supposed Paris meeting never happened.\n\nHe emailed conservative media outlet The Blaze the following morning to bat down a report that carried the headline, \"John Kerry caught meeting with Iranians in France — and there’s a photo to prove it.\"\n\n\"Kerry had no such meeting or encounter in Paris — no meeting with Iranians,\" Wade wrote in a May 13 email to an editor at The Blaze. \"Nor does a photo of what looks like him walking down a street alone show any such thing.\"\n\nKerry spokesman Matthew Summers acknowledged the former secretary of state was in Paris during the relevant time frame, but denied any meeting with Iranians occurred — and backed up his denial with a fairly detailed itinerary of Kerry’s brief stay in the French capital:\n\n\"Secretary Kerry was in Europe for a few days last week – he gave a speech in Milan, flew to London for a charity dinner and then took a train to Paris on the 11th and returned home to Boston on the 13th, just in time to spend Mother’s Day with his wife.\n\n\"He was in Paris to see his friend Tim Collins and they had a few meals together, including one with Ted Snyder, the dean of Yale’s business school - and he had no meetings with any Iranians whatsoever. His trip was completely unrelated.\n\n\"Not surprisingly, he still travels overseas frequently. It certainly appears to be him in the photo but is just a random shot of him on a sidewalk – no proof of any sort of meeting – people take photos of him everywhere he goes on their phones.\"\n\nAn Iranian government official called allegations that Kerry and Kharazi met in Paris \"total lie.\" The official acknowledged Kharazi was in the French capital at the time, but said he was there to attend a meeting for a group called \"Leaders for Peace Foundation.\"\n\nWe tried multiple times to reach the restaurant L'Avenue, where the alleged meeting occurred.

This figure is not mentioned in any of them (ranges from 10s of 1000s to 100s of 1000s; some mention that organisers estimate over a million). If there is a source for this I’d be thrilled to know it was so many. 1/", "target": "No evidence that People’s Vote march had over two million people\n\nAfter the People’s Vote march on Saturday 19 October, tweets claiming that there were either two million or 2.2 million people on the march went viral.\n\nThe viral claims say that the figure of two million was reported by Sky News, and that the figure of 2.2 million came from “German TV”. The three most widely shared tweets reporting one or both of these numbers—including one from Alastair Campbell, and another from TechCrunch editor-at-large Mike Butcher—have over 8,000 retweets between them.\n\nThere is no evidence of either Sky News or German TV reporting these figures. Crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University have told us that 2 million is an implausible estimate.\n\nThe first reference we’ve seen linking the numbers to Sky and German TV came from a tweet posted by an anonymous account at 3.54pm on the day of the march, which referred to those figures being from the “last march”. The same tweet was also identified by Professor Tanja Bueltmann of Northumbria University, who wrote about her attempts to find a source for the figures. Since then, hundreds of other tweets have repeated the same claims.\n\nNone of the tweets we have seen gave a source for the claims—even, as Professor Bueltmann points out, after being asked to do so.\n\nSky and German TV put the number in in the tens or hundreds of thousands\n\nThe “German TV” station supposedly behind the claim is not identified in any of the tweets we’ve seen. However, of the major German television news stations or programmes, Tagesschau reported the march as having “hundreds of thousands” of participants, as did n-tv. Deutsche Welle opted for “tens of thousands”, as did ZDF, while Welt simply opted for “thousands”. None of them mention any higher estimate from a rival.\n\nWe also can’t find any major German non-television news outlet reporting the figure. Die Zeit said “hundreds of thousands”, as did Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Bild said hundreds of thousands were expected, Süddeutsche Zeitung reported the organisers’ claim of one million, as did Die Tageszeitung.\n\nJournalist Mike Butcher claims to have explained the methodology behind the supposed German TV estimate of 2.2 million. While his explanation is undoubtedly a methodology (which we have not verified), he still does not provide any evidence that this methodology was used by German TV, or that German TV made an estimate of 2.2 million in the first place.\n\nSky News also reported the figure as “hundreds of thousands”. We asked Sky News if it reported a figure of two million. They told us that they had not produced their own official estimate of the crowd size, although it’s possible that their coverage may have reported on a claim that the crowd size was that large. We haven’t been able to find any reference to the figure in Sky’s online coverage.\n\nExpert evidence suggests a crowd in the hundreds of thousands\n\nWe spoke to crowd science experts at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU). Their calculations show it is implausible that 2 million people could have attended the march.\n\nThey used two separate methods which both produced estimates in the low hundreds of thousands at most. They said a more precise estimate would require more time and analysis.\n\nFirstly they estimated the overall average crowd density of the entire march area to have been 1.5-3 people per square metre, based on aerial footage of the march. The images below illustrate a density of 2 and 3 people per square metre respectively.\n\nGiven that the total area occupied by the crowd was observed at around 70,000 square metres, that means a crowd of between 105,000 and 210,000 people could have fitted along the total area of the route at any given time (though some more may have been in side streets and nearby areas).\n\nThis doesn’t cover the assembly area on Park Lane (which, aerial footage shows, was fairly empty at the height of the march). Even if you included it, the total march area would be roughly double, giving a capacity of around 200-400,000 people based on the observed crowd density—still well below 2 million.\n\nAnother way MMU estimated the total crowd size was to work out how many people could have passed through the official march route, over the course of its duration. This method acknowledges that crowds are fluid with people arriving and departing at different times\n\nTo do this you need to look at flow through the narrowest point of a march, which MMU measured to be 20 metres wide.\n\nThey told us that you could expect around 1,000-1,200 people to pass through that point every minute (based on a crowd density of four people per square metre—the safe limit in most situations).\n\nGiven that the march lasted 180 minutes, that gives a theoretical maximum capacity of 216,000 people walking along the march route over its total duration (1,200 people multiplied by 180 minutes).\n\nAgain, this doesn’t factor in people who might not have walked the official route, and the fact that the event did not come to a sudden halt after three hours exactly. But the march would have had to carry on for over 30 hours to fit a crowd of two million people along the official route.\n\nBased on the weight of evidence, the crowd at Saturday’s march was likely in the low-to-mid hundreds of thousands and certainly not in the millions.", "rewrites": "Sure, here are the rewritten tweets:\n\nRewritten Tweet 1: \"I’ve watched every German news program from yesterday, and none mentioned this unbelievable figure (ranges from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands; some say organizers estimate over a million).

Soon after these results were announced, the Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio took to twitter announcing that Delhi Government schools did better than private schools for a second year in row. He also said that pass percentage ofDelhi Government schools is 88.27% & private schools is 79.27%.\n\nHe went onto tweet that Delhi government schools had 2% better results than private schools in 2016 and in 2017, the lead increased to 9%.\n\n\n\n In fact, in a rare case of a BJP Minister appreciating AAP, union minister for Urban Development, Venkaiah Naidu tweeted a Times of India story on these results and said that Delhi government schools taking a 9% lead over private schools is impressive.\n\n\n\n Almost all media houses like the Times of India, The Hindu, India Today , First Post, Hindustan Times shared these statistics. Times of India has also done an infographic on the Delhi results.\n\nAll the media houses went by what Manish Sisodia tweeted and did not care to check the data released by CBSE. CBSE put out a detailed statistical statement like every year and this tells a different story.\n\nDid Delhi government schools take a 9% lead over the private Schools?\n\nManish Sisodia, in a hurry to prove that Delhi government schools did better than private schools made the mistake of comparing the pass percentage of government schools in Delhi and private schools across India. Let us examine the two the statements made by Manish Sisodia.\n\nWhile it is true that Delhi government schools did better than Delhi private schools, it is not the first time. It is in fact 3rd year in row and not second as Manish Sisodia tweeted. Delhi Government schools have fared better than their private counter parts since 2015. Manish Sisodia’s claim that the pass percentage in Delhi government schools is 88.27% is also factually incorrect. As per CBSE’s official statistical statement, the pass percentage in Delhi government schools is 88.36%. The pass percentage of Delhi private schools is 84.2% and not 79.27% as tweeted by Sisodia. 79.27% is the pass percentage of private schools at an All-India level and not Delhi\n\nStatement 2: Government Schools did 9% better in 2017\n\nManish Sisodia’s second tweet is about the 9% better results in government schools this year compared to the 2% in 2016. While he is right about the 2% lead in 2016 (Government: 88.98% Vs Private: 86.67%), he is wrong about the 9% lead in 2017. He calculated the 9% lead taking the All India private schools pass percentage in 2017 which is 79.27% instead of Delhi private schools. The CBSE data shows that the Delhi private schools pass percentage in 2017 is 84.2% and not 79.27% as was claimed by Sisodia and other media houses. If this taken into consideration, then the lead is only 4% and not 9%. One cannot compare Delhi figures in 2016 and All-India figures in 2017. If the lead was 2% in 2016, then the lead is 4% in 2017. Else, if the All-India private schools pass percentage is compared in both years, then the lead in 2016 was 6.5% and in 2017 is 9%.\n\nHave government schools done better under AAP?\n\nIn Delhi, the government schools have maintained a consistent pass percentage of around 88% in each of the years starting 2013. In the same time period, the private schools have slipped from 91.83% in 2013 to 84.2% in 2017. Even at an All-India level, the private schools have slipped from 82.31% in 2013 to 79.27% in 2017. The government schools on the other hand slipped from 84.89% in 2013 to 82.29% in 2017. While the performance of Delhi government schools hasn’t improved in terms of absolute pass percentage during the AAP rule, they have maintained the 88% when all others slipped.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Govt schools in #Delhi reportedly lead by 4% over private institutions in the #CbseResults2017!\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you know Delhi Govt schools have a 4% advantage over private schools in the #CbseResults2017?

The 4-year-old with suspected pneumonia forced to lie on a pile of coats on the floor of a Leeds hospital.The PM grabbed my phone and put it in his pocket:| #GE19", "target": "In the final days of the U.K. general election campaign in December 2019, controversy erupted over a photograph taken at Leeds General Infirmary, in the northern county of Yorkshire, which appeared to show a young boy sleeping on the floor due to a lack of available beds.\n\nHowever, a wave of Facebook and Twitter posts later appeared to undermine the authenticity of the image, claiming insider information that cast the episode as a stunt designed to damage the Conservative Party government, and boost the main opposition Labour Party. As a result of that uncertainty, we received multiple inquiries from Snopes readers about the authenticity of, and context surrounding, the photograph.\n\nIn reality, the photograph was authentic, and the context and account provided by the boy’s mother — that he was forced to sleep on the floor due to the unavailability of beds — was confirmed by hospital authorities who have since apologized. Viral social media posts claiming to have proof that the photograph was staged “propaganda” were in fact themselves bogus, and part of a wave of misinformation, likely coordinated, and potentially with sinister intent.\n\nOn Dec. 8, The Yorkshire Evening Post was the first to report on the experience of 4-year-old Jack Williment-Barr after he was brought by ambulance on Dec. 3 to the infirmary with suspected pneumonia. That article included the now-famous photograph of the boy lying on coats on the floor of the hospital, covered in a blanket and with an oxygen mask.\n\nThe boy’s mother, Sarah Williment, told the Post he had been forced to wait in a clinical treatment room for four hours, and went 13 hours without access to a bed, such was the overcrowding at the hospital on that day. Hospital authorities confirmed Williment’s account and offered a personal apology to her and Jack, as the Post reported:\n\n“Our hospitals are extremely busy at the moment and we are very sorry that Jack’s family had a long wait in our Emergency Department. Our Chief Executive Julian Hartley has spoken to Jack’s mum and offered a personal apology. We have seen a significant increase in the number of people visiting our Paediatric Emergency Department, and this week we saw the highest attendances we have seen since April 2016. Despite this, our staff are working tirelessly to provide the best possible care under these extreme pressures. “Jack was quickly assessed upon arrival and seen in two different clinical treatment rooms in the Paediatric Emergency Department.Within four hours a decision was made to admit Jack to our Children’s Assessment and Treatment (CAT) Unit for further monitoring overnight. Unfortunately, the unit was also experiencing exceptionally high levels of demand which meant that Jack was required to wait in the clinical treatment room in the Paediatric Emergency Department until a bed became available. Jack was admitted to the CAT Unit later that evening and was discharged home the following morning after a medical review. “We are extremely sorry that there were only chairs available in the treatment room, and no bed. This falls below our usual high standards, and for this we would like to sincerely apologise to Jack and his family.”\n\nThe article, and in particular the photograph, quickly developed into a major national news story in the U.K., and the widely read national tabloid newspaper the Daily Mirror ran the story, with the photograph, on its front page, the following morning, along with the headline “DESPERATE — Picture that shames Tories”:\n\nWilliment-Barr’s experience also became a significant moment in the general election campaign. The opposition Labour Party had already made the National Health Service (NHS), and the ruling Conservatives’ management of it, a central plank in its election messaging. When the Leeds story broke, the party and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, seized upon it:\n\nThe damage to the Conservative Party government was exacerbated when Prime Minister Boris Johnson initially refused to look at the photograph of Williment-Barr, when presented it by a journalist, and even took the journalist’s phone and put it in his own pocket. He later looked at the photograph and apologized for taking the phone, and offered an apology to the boy’s family:\n\nThen, something strange happened. Within a day of the story’s first breaking, Facebook and Twitter were populated with a wave of posts attacking the credibility of the photograph, and claiming to have inside information from Leeds General Infirmary that showed that the image of Williment-Barr was no more than a stunt and “Momentum propaganda,” a reference to the left-wing movement within Labour, which is regarded as a reliable and vocal source of support for Corbyn’s leadership of the party.\n\nThe posts were identical, meaning they could not have been authentic. They read as follows:\n\n“Very interesting. A good friend of mine is a senior nursing sister at Leeds Hospital – the boy shown on the floor by the media was in fact put there by his mother who then took photos on her mobile phone and uploaded it to media outlets before he climbed back onto his trolley. He was on a hospital trolley in the paediatric [accident and emergency] having been seen within 20 minutes. I am a nurse myself and am so pissed off with fake news, yes the NHS is a mess mainly caused by people misusing it and lack of elderly care. Think of the nurses and Doctors who are doing their jobs instead of constantly slagging them off. another Momentum\n\n Propaganda story. Disgraceful.”\n\nOn Dec. 9 and 10, a second wave of identical posts spread on Facebook and Twitter, again seeking to undermine the credibility of Sarah Williment’s account of her son’s experience. This time, each of the posters claimed — using the exact same wording — that they themselves were “a former paediatric A&E [accident and emergency] and PICU [pediatric intensive care unit] nurse.” This second bogus post read as follows:\n\n“I’m a former paediatric A&E and PICU nurse and that child has a style of O2 mask in front of him that requires 6-8l/min to inflate like that. If a child needed that amount of O2 they’d be in resus for proper monitoring. He’d also have a cannula and be propped head up.”\n\nIt’s not clear who or what entity was behind what appears to have been two coordinated disinformation responses to the Leeds hospital photograph, but the posts were clearly intended to distract and confuse the British public, and limit the damage done to the Conservative Party, only a few days before voters went to the polls, on Dec. 12.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Shocking image of 4-year-old Jack lying on hospital floor with pneumonia!

Iran could threaten Trump hotels *worldwide* and he could provoke war over the loss of revenue from skittish guests.His business interests should not be driving military decisions.", "target": "In January 2020, readers inquired about the accuracy of an article that claimed U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., had given Iran “military advice,” committing treason against the United States.\n\nOn Jan. 7, the right-wing website PJ Media published an article with the headline “Treason? Ilhan Omar Gives Iran Military Advice, Suggests It Could Target Trump Hotels.” The article reported that:\n\nThe inspiringly patriotic Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Tehran, no, check that, I’m hearing she’s from Minnesota) tweeted Monday offering some unsolicited military advice to the Islamic Republic of Iran: “Trump needs to immediately divest from his businesses and comply with the emoluments clause. Iran could threaten Trump hotels *worldwide* and he could provoke war over the loss of revenue from skittish guests. His business interests should not be driving military decisions.” She also tweeted a video in which the late comedian George Carlin asserts that the U.S. is “not very good at anything” besides war. And so once again we have to ask the by-now-familiar question: Is Ilhan Omar a traitor who hates America? Omar’s warning that Trump’s “business interests should not be driving military decisions” makes no sense, because clearly the fact that Trump owns hotels that Iran could target didn’t stop him from going after Qasem Soleimani. But as far as Omar and her ideological allies are concerned, it doesn’t matter how much they have to twist their logic into pretzels to get Trump, as long as they make the president look bad. That imperative has now driven Omar even to give a military suggestion to a hostile foreign power. The mullahs and their henchmen haven’t said anything about targeting Trump hotels, so here is a United States congresswoman to give them a marvelous new idea about how they could murder Americans and others, and further menace the United States. The definition of treason is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. The leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran order their people to chant “Death to America” in mosques every Friday, and repeatedly vow that they will ultimately destroy the United States of America and the state of Israel. They were doing this before Soleimani was killed, and they’re doing it now. How is giving them a suggestion about how they could target the United States, whether or not they have or would have thought of it themselves, not giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and hence treason?\n\nOmar has long been a target of misinformation and false allegations, often transparently motivated by Islamophobia and xenophobia. Those attacks escalated and intensified after she became, along with Rashida Tlaib, the first Muslim woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, in 2018. PJ Media’s article was written by Robert Spencer, founder of the anti-Muslim JihadWatch website, who routinely conflates Islamic fundamentalist violence with any and all professions of Muslim faith, and falsely presents even moderate Muslims (such as Omar) as being part of a shadowy global conspiracy to conquer Western democracies and impose shariah law throughout the world.\n\nIn her Jan. 6 tweet, Omar was not giving “military advice” to Iran, nor was she engaging in anything that remotely resembled “treason.” That her remarks were singled out by critics did not provide evidence of any anti-Americanism on her part, but rather constituted an elegant illustration of the distortion and double standards to which she is routinely subjected.\n\nOn Jan. 6, in the aftermath of the U.S. assassination of high-profile Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani, and in light of Iranian government vows to avenge his death, Omar tweeted: “Trump needs to immediately divest from his businesses and comply with the emoluments clause. Iran could threaten Trump hotels *worldwide* and he could provoke war over the loss of revenue from skittish guests. His business interests should not be driving military decisions.”\n\nOmar was not making a suggestion to Iran, she was articulating an analysis — that Iran, in seeking revenge for Soleimani’s assassination, could potentially target Trump-branded hotels around the world. The same rather obvious point had already been made on several occasions by several other observers in the days between Soleimani’s assassination and the congresswoman’s tweet.\n\nFor example, the right-leaning Washington Times cited several security experts as cautioning that Trump hotels and properties could be subject to Iranian revenge attacks. Among them was former FBI Assistant Director Lewis Schiliro, who headed the agency’s New York field office and supervised the investigation into the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. On the subject of potential attacks against Trump properties, he said: “The greater danger is the lone jihadist, someone who feels empowered based on recent events to take action, that becomes the more difficult threat to guard against.”\n\nOn Jan. 3, Iran expert Suzanne Maloney, from the Brookings Institution, said: “They [Iran] will look for the most opportune chance to strike back in a way that hurts President Trump personally. They take these things in a very personal fashion, and so I would assume that security all around any kind of a Trump property to be — if it has not already been — significantly enhanced.”\n\nOn Jan. 4, Hesameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, prompted speculation that he was hinting at a possible avenue for retaliation, when he tweeted a link to a Forbes article that listed the locations of multiple Trump-owned properties throughout the world.\n\nThose concerns had already been articulated when Omar broadly reiterated them on Jan. 6. She made the additional argument that, in light of the potential threat to Trump properties, the president should divest himself of any interest in them, so as to completely avoid any possibility that his financial self-interest might influence his decision-making as regards the Iranian conflict.\n\nNothing in the congresswoman’s tweet indicated any measure whatsoever of encouragement of an Iranian attack on Trump properties or gratification at the prospect of such an attack, nor that she was providing advice or making a suggestion with Iran as the intended recipient. The same was true of the insights offered by Maloney, Schiliro, and several others. Therefore, the claim that Omar gave Iran “military advice,” and that she had engaged in treason, was false.\n\nThe fact that PJ Media leveled those accusations against Omar, but not against Schiliro or Maloney, for example, and that other websites scrutinized her pronouncements, but not theirs, provided a stark illustration of the distortions and double standards to which the Minnesota congresswoman is routinely subjected.\n\nPublicly (and falsely) accusing a Muslim, foreign-born U.S. congresswoman of treasonously providing military advice to Iran also had the predictable effect of prompting some observers to encourage violence against her. Among the user responses to PJ Media’s Jan. 7 Facebook post promoting Spencer’s article, Snopes found 131 comments, some of them particularly graphic and disturbing, that encouraged, threatened, or expressed a wish for violence, execution, death, disease, or murder against Omar or her family members.

The woman, wearing medical gear, says she works in Delhi's Rao Tularam Memorial Hospital.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that there is no truth in the claim. In fact, the Rao Tularam Memorial Hospital is not even among Delhi's nine designated hospitals to treat coronavirus cases. This hospital does not have any coronavirus patient. It is not even an isolation centre for suspected cases.\n\nSeveral Facebook users and pages such as \"Bhakt Namo Ka\" have shared the video with a caption in Hindi which translates to, \"Kejriwal's new order says doctors on corona duty have to pay their own hotel bills. This man has turned on his promise again. He has money to pay the salaries of maulvis\"\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIn the viral video, a woman wearing a mask and headgear as worn by hospital staff says she is posted in Rao Tularam Memorial Hospital. She says, \"We have received orders to vacate the hotel. We have been posted here since 16th. We were adjusting somehow, but now, where will our families go?\"\n\nThe woman claims there are many patients in the hospital who are coronavirus positive and questions as to why the safety of doctors' families is not being considered.\n\nTo probe the allegations, AFWA first searched the Delhi government website for the list of corona-designated hospitals. We found an order dated March 31, which said there were five designated hospitals in the state to deal with Covid cases. Right now, the number has increased to nine, which can be seen in the daily bulletin issued by the state government. None of these orders or bulletins has the name of Rao Tularam Memorial Hospital.\n\nIn fact, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain's advisor Shaleen Mitra had recently tweeted on the matter. \"Rao Tula Raam hospital is neither a COVID hospital nor a quarantine centre and No Doctor/Staff of the hospital is on COVID Duty. Hence this doesn't seem to be a genuine complaint,\" he had said.\n\nWe reached out to Mitra and he said, \"Since Rao Tularam Memorial Hospital was never a designated hospital for treating Covid-19 patients, therefore, arranging for the stay of doctors and other staff in hotels from this hospital and payment of their bills was not done at any point.\"\n\n\"If a patient goes there with symptoms of Covid-19, the hospital has to immediately send the person to a designated hospital for treating Covid-19. Such patients cannot be admitted to Rao Tularam. It is not even a centre to quarantine or isolate patients. On the other hand, the Delhi government is still arranging for the stay of doctors and other hospital staff in hotels and making their bill payments,\" Mitra added.\n\nOn April 20, the Delhi government had issued an order which clearly states that accommodation is being provided to doctors, nurses, paramedics and other medical staff of dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, health centres, quarantine centres and even test centres.\n\nMitra said the Delhi government had also investigated the viral video, but they could not find out the identity of the woman and if she is really posted in the hospital. \"The woman in the video has put on a mask and also covered her hair. It is very difficult to identify her with just the eyes and voice,\" Mitra said.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the Delhi government is still arranging accommodation for doctors and other staff on the frontline in the war against Covid-19.

An excuse just as fake as his news. #FredoCuomo", "target": "CNN’s Chris Cuomo has apologized for exploding at a man who called him Fredo as Cuomo was out with his family. An Aug. 12 video of the encounter captured Cuomo saying, \"Punk a-- b------ from the right call me Fredo,\" and \"they use it as an Italian aspersion.\"\n\n\"It's like the 'N-word' for us,\" Cuomo said.\n\nThe two men nearly came to blows and the raw emotion fueled an eruption on Twitter.\n\nPresident Donald Trump joined the storm, tweeting Aug. 13, \"I thought Chris was Fredo also. The truth hurts.\"\n\nNeedless to say, Fredo is not a compliment. It comes from \"The Godfather\" movie epic, a reference to Fredo Corleone, the failed, envious brother of the Mafia family chief Michael. In Fredo’s grasping need for recognition, he exposes his brother to a gangland hit.\n\nThe term is synonymous with the family loser. Things don’t go well for Fredo. In Godfather terms, he ends up sleeping with the fishes.\n\nCuomo is the younger brother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the son of Mario Cuomo, who was the state’s governor from 1983 to 1994.\n\nThe biggest debate on Twitter is whether Fredo is like the \"N-word,\" as Cuomo put it.\n\nThe general consensus is that it is not, but in some circumstances, it can take on ethnic overtones.\n\nCuomo said conservatives have used the Fredo label against him, and they have. In March, Breitbart, former organizational base of early Trump adviser Steve Bannon, described Cuomo as \"a rabid Trump-hater lacking in the intelligence and knowledge to do his job with anything close to competence.\"\n\n\"This has earned him the nickname ‘Fredo,’\" Breitbart said.\n\nIn May, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh spoke of \"Fredo Cuomo\" and \"the abject ignorance of media people.\"\n\nEthnic slur? Not so much\n\nIt’s clear why Cuomo was insulted when a stranger came up to him and called him Fredo, but his comparison to one of the ugliest of racist words is off target.\n\nLinguist Geoffrey Nunberg, who teaches at the UC Berkeley School of Information, said \"almost nothing\" is equivalent to the N-word.\n\n\"There are plenty of abusive epithets for Italian Americans,\" University of Edinburgh linguist Geoff Pullum said. \"I don't think Fredo is even in the class of stereotypical names for Italian Americans.\"\n\nScanning its use, Fredo is an all-purpose term with no consistent Italian overtones. It is a metaphor for the weak link in any group.\n\nJournalists and pundits have applied the Fredo tag to a variety of people. In a 2017 article headlined \"Why Donald Trump Jr is the Fredo Corleone of the Trump clan,\" the Daily Standard wrote, \"Fredo was the nickname given by the President’s campaign team to his eldest child, Donald Jr.\"\n\nTrump critics have used the word to describe Donald Trump Jr. more than a few times, including, as Trump Jr. noted in a tweet, once during a Cuomo interview.\n\nAs former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt wrestled with ethics charges, MSNBC’s Chris Matthews said Trump was giving him \"the Fredo treatment.\"\n\nA Daily Beast op-ed called Rep. Devin Nunes, R- Calif., \"the Fredo of L’Affaire Russe.\" Over the years, sports commentators have slapped the label on ailing teams including the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cleveland Browns. Arbor Day was called \"the Fredo Corleone of national holidays.\"\n\nPlenty of people with Italian last names posted on Twitter that they took no particular offense over Fredo.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean the word has no sting when applied to people with Italian heritage. The portrayal of the fictional Corleone family has served as a stereotype for Italian Americans that some feel has been ill-served.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House spokesman, tweeted his support for Cuomo.\n\n\"Very proud of ⁦@ChrisCuomo. This happens all the time. It’s quite racist,\" Scaramucci wrote.\n\nFeelings about Trump tend to shape the recent assessments of the overtones of Fredo, but even allowing for that, Nunberg says ethnic slurs have a way of weaseling their way into a language.\n\n\"It’s a familiar pattern,\" Nunberg told us. \"The name of a specific ethnic fictional character becomes a slur for the group that he or she represents. Fredo might be an appropriate analogy for a certain kind of dim younger brother, but when it’s used on Chris Cuomo, it inevitably takes on an ethnic cast.\"", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Is it true that CNN’s head of PR still believes “Fredo” is as offensive as they say?

The article listed pros and cons of several potential candidates. The story also said that UK's Treasury was expected to publish an advertisement for the job in July, a year ahead of the end of Mark Carney’s term and that a formal process had not yet started.\n\nThat did not stop the fake news brigade in India to jump to conclude Rajan had already bagged the prestigious job.

He claimed that two bike-borne men pounded on his car windows and threw bottles when he was driving home from work with his wife. Since then, several social media users have accused Goswami of manufacturing the alleged attack. National coordinator of Congress IT cell Gaurav Pandhi claimed that the metadata of Goswami’s video reveals that it was shot much before the alleged attack. Congress member Suraj Hegde and Twitter handle Rofl Republic also tweeted the purported metadata.\n\nNational campaign in-charge of IYC, Srivatsa, claimed that BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra and filmmaker Ashoke Pandit knew about the alleged attack before the information was shared by Republic TV. His claim was based on the timing of the tweets put out by the channels and the two individuals.\n\nThat Patra knew of the alleged attack before Republic TV was also tweeted by the handle @dostam_comrade (drawing over 1,200 retweets) and @VinayDokania (gathering close to 700 retweets).\n\nIn this fact-check, we shall analyse both claims separately.\n\n1. Does the metadata of the video show that it was shot before Republic TV informed viewers of the alleged attack?\n\n2. Did Sambit Patra and Ashoke Pandit tweet about the alleged attack before it happened?\n\nThe answer to both the questions is no. Let’s see why.\n\nMetadata is essentially data (information) about data. Certain tools expose the metadata associated with videos. But such data is accurate only when extracted from the original file. Metadata is modified based on the platform where the video is sent. Metadata of Twitter files will show date and time based on when they were uploaded on the platform, not when they were shot.\n\nCongress members used the website metadata2go.com to extract the metadata of the video. They downloaded the video and uploaded it on the website. Readers can also try the same for the purpose of self-verification. The website shows the time as 20:17 (8:17 PM) on April 22. However, in the ‘tags’ section, the website gives the time as ‘2020-04-22T20:17:11.000000Z’. The letter ‘Z’ denotes Zulu Time which is the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), now known as the Universal Time Coordinated (UTC).\n\nTo adjust this with the Indian Standard Time (IST), one needs to add 5:30 hours which means that the creation time is 1:47 AM, April 23. This is the exact time when Republic TV uploaded the video on Twitter.\n\nTwitter user Ravi Nair added another claim. He checked the video on YouTube and suggested that Goswami’s statement was created at 21:04 UTC or 2:34 AM IST on April 23, before the purported attack took place at 12:15 AM. His analysis was based on the results he derived from metadata2go.com.\n\nHowever, when Alt News checked the same on metadata2go.com, we got a different result. This means that checking the metadata of a YouTube video by downloading and uploading it to metadata2go.com is not a reliable process. A much better tool to check YouTube metadata is Amnesty International’s YouTube DataViewer. According to Amnesty, the video was uploaded on YouTube at 21:13 or 2:43 AM IST on April 23.\n\nSame as Twitter, YouTube strips all the metadata from a video. The time showed by Amnesty is the upload time on YouTube, not the actual date of creation of the video.\n\nTherefore, several Congress members and social media users misinterpreted the upload time on Twitter and YouTube as the true metadata (date of creation) of the video. Furthermore, the metadata reflected the time in UTC which has to be adjusted to reflect the Indian time.\n\nIn the video, Goswami claimed that he was attacked at 12:15 AM on April 23. Republic TV’s first tweet about the alleged attack was put out at 1:06 AM. Sambit Patra and Ashoke Pandit tweeted a few minutes before at 1:05 AM and 12:55 AM respectively. This caused many to believe that the two individuals knew about the purported attack before Republic TV broke the news.\n\nHowever, social media is not the only place to break news. Republic TV had disclosed the alleged attack during a 12:45 AM broadcast. This was before the channel either tweeted about it or uploaded Goswami’s video on Youtube.\n\nThe claim that Patra and Pandit knew about the alleged attack before it took place was based on the time of Republic TV’s tweet. However, the channel had reported on the alleged incident first on TV, then on social media. Both allegations by Congress members and several other social media users are therefore, false.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Mr Arnab 'Nation wants to know' about the mysterious timing of your video being shown as created at 8:17 PM on April 22!

A man named Vishnu Goswami was burned alive in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh reportedly over a verbal altercation. The youth was taken to a hospital in Lucknow for recovery. According to Dainik Jagran, Goswami was beating his father when four men intervened, which led to an argument. The altercation soon took a turn for the worst. The men poured petrol on Goswami and set him of fire. The police arrested the perpetrators namely, Imran, Tufail, Nizamuddin and Ramzan.\n\nAccording to a subsequent report in Amar Ujala, the perpetrators were drivers who transported oil tankers. Vishnu succumbed to his injuries on May 19.\n\nThe incident was also reported by Hindustan Times, according to which, “The victim’s cousin, Raj Kumar Goswami, said the incident occurred when Vishnu and his brother Mahesh had gone to get back their drunken father, Ramgeer Goswami, who was loitering near the village, under Kotwali Dehat police limits, at around 8.30 pm on Tuesday. He said the four accused got into a verbal duel with the brothers while they were trying to take their father home. The accused confronted Vishnu and allegedly set him ablaze after pouring petrol on him when he was washing his face after the heated exchange.”\n\nHowever, the video of the man burning alive does not correspond to the said incident. Gonda police tweeted about the misinformation on May 16. “It has come to our notice that people are using a misleading image to spread a rumour by giving the incident a communal colour to cause disruption. This is illegal and irresponsible,” the police wrote.\n\nGonda police reiterated to Alt News in a phone conversation that the incident was not communally motivated.

Due to unbearable mental stress exerted by the police, Kalpesh committed suicide in their presence. We have taken the footage to support this. The incident was also recorded by Kamlesh Rawal, Vinod Rawal and Chandresh Parmar,” the journalists said in a plea.\n\nAn old video was, therefore, shared in the context of a recent event.

That led to long-running shows such as “Cops” and “Live PD” getting canceled, and spurred a number of people who worked on TV shows about law enforcement to donate to causes related to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAs protests nationwide gained momentum, some social media users posted tongue-in-cheek messages calling for the cancellation of the animated children’s show. This led to a think piece published in The New York Times that stated “it was only a matter of time before the protests came for “Paw Patrol.”\n\nThe excerpt from the Times story:\n\n“Paw Patrol” is a children’s cartoon about a squad of canine helpers. It is basically a pretense for placing household pets in a variety of cool trucks. The team includes Marshall, a firefighting Dalmatian; Rubble, a bulldog construction worker; and Chase, a German shepherd who is also a cop. In the world of “Paw Patrol,” Chase is drawn to be a very good boy who barks stuff like “Chase is on the case!” and “All in a police pup’s day!” as he rescues kittens in his tricked-out S.U.V. But last week, when the show’s official Twitter account put out a bland call for “Black voices to be heard,” commenters came after Chase. “Euthanize the police dog,” they said. “Defund the paw patrol.” “All dogs go to heaven, except the class traitors in the Paw Patrol.” It’s a joke, but it’s also not. As the protests against racist police violence enter their third week, the charges are mounting against fictional cops, too. Even big-hearted cartoon police dogs — or maybe especially big-hearted cartoon police dogs — are on notice. The effort to publicize police brutality also means banishing the good-cop archetype, which reigns on both television and in viral videos of the protests themselves. “Paw Patrol” seems harmless enough, and that’s the point: The movement rests on understanding that cops do plenty of harm.\n\nShortly after the Times story was published, conservative figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump’s son Eric and Dana Loesch, sometime spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, said that the “rage mob” was making an effort to cancel the show.\n\nAs far as we can tell, earnest calls to have “Paw Patrol” canceled due to its portrayal of police officers have been few and far between. While the vast majority of the posts calling for the cancellation of “Paw Patrol” were made in jest, they were prompted by a genuine conversation concerning the impact of how police officers are portrayed in television and movies.\n\nAn old article from the satirical news publication The Onion may have contributed to some confusion over whether or not “Paw Patrol” got canceled. In 2018, The Onion published an article claiming that a “Paw Patrol” writer was defending an episode in which a German shepherd shot a black Lab 18 times in the back.\n\nMeanwhile, Nickelodeon, the network that airs “Paw Patrol,” has also released messages in support of the protests. It should also be noted that on June 7, 2020, the show went silent on social media in solidarity, muting its content:", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Did you hear the rumors?

But they forced me to remain quiet and kept approving the loans till May 2014. Why am I being blamed for the PNB scam now?.\"\n\nIn an exclusive email response to BOOM, Rajan said, \"This is pure, utter rubbish, put out by motivated sources. You can say I said that, to anyone who wants to listen.\"\n\nBOOM looked for the quote on social media and found that several individuals believed it to be genuine. A few individuals shared the quote image that had fake news and propaganda website Postcard News' logo on it.\n\nHow To Identify A Fake Quote\n\nWhile several users shared the fake quote, there were many red flags for discerning readers to spot the disinformation.\n\nFirst, a simple Google search of the quote would have shown that there were no articles or links by any credible website. And it is implausible that Rajan would confess or exclusively speak to a fake news website such as Postcard News to defend himself. Read here how BOOM called out Postcard News in the past for creating fake quotes of Bollywood actors.\n\nSecondly, it is unlikely that a media and technology savvy Bharatiya Janata Party would not use such a quote as ammo against the opposition. We searched BJP's official handle @BJP4India on Twitter and Facebook and have not seen them reacting to this politically explosive quote attributed to the former RBI Governor.\n\nThirdly, Rahul Gandhi who was Vice President of the Congress party during Rajan's tenure never held any ministerial post during the UPA's rule between 2004 to 2014. It is unheard of for an RBI Governor to warn a party leader about any banking fraud. And even if he did, to eventually talk about it publicly would be adding fuel to fire.\n\nFinally, the post is replete with grammatical and spelling mistakes such as 'Ex Governer' and 'frauds'.\n\nBOOM has not been independently able to verify who created this fake quote though many users have shared the image and the text with Postcard News' logo.\n\nMeanwhile Rajan continues to face flak from sections of the media and social media on whether he was aware of the PNB scam. Columnist Shobhaa De also tweeted asking how this Rs 11,000 crore scam took place under his watch.\n\nLast week, news website Moneycontrol had reported about the Bullion & Jewellers Association sending a letter to Rajan on July 26, 2014, accusing the previous UPA government of “deliberately yielding to the cronies” by changing the gold policy days before demitting office and approving the 80:20 scheme. The association says they had warned Rajan to act before its too late.\n\nMoneycontrol's story said \"A decision was taken on May 21, 2014, five days before the UPA government officially demitted office, allowed 13 'star trading houses (STH)' and 'premier trading houses (PTH)’ including Choksi-led Gitanjali Gems to import gold and sell about 80 percent of their total bullion shipment in local markets under the so-called 80:20 scheme. This, it now turns out, encouraged gold hoarding and preferentially allowed these traders to profiteer by artificially inflating retail prices.\"\n\nHowever, it is not clear how the change of this policy at the last minute by the outgoing UPA government helped Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi in defrauding the banks and whether any linkages have been found with the scam.\n\nBOOM also wrote to Rajan seeking his comment on these accusations.

All 10 provinces have shut down schools for some length of time, but as of March 25, no province had ordered schools closed for the rest of the school year.\n\nThe Facebook post also mischaracterized Canada’s economic response to the coronavirus.\n\nOn March 18, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced several actions, some of which were replaced in the final legislation, that the government would take to temper the economic burden faced by Canadians.\n\nFor starters, the government implemented \"a six-month, interest-free, moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments for all individuals who are in the process of repaying these loans\" and secured \"a six-month payment deferral for mortgages,\" according to the press release.\n\nThe government also pledged to introduce an emergency care benefit to provide pay for people who miss work due to the coronavirus and do not have access to paid sick leave.\n\nThe benefit would have provided \"up to $900 bi-weekly for up to 15 weeks\" to Canadian workers who are sick, quarantined, under instructions to self-isolate or taking care of a family member or child who is sick, quarantined, self-isolating or home from school due to closures.\n\nThat’s not $950 — nor is it worth the same amount in American dollars — and it would not have gone to \"each family\" every two weeks, as the Facebook post wrongly claimed.\n\nThe emergency care benefit would have applied only to workers impacted by COVID-19, while an expansion of child benefits would have delivered more money to families with children.\n\nMore importantly, the emergency care benefit and another proposed benefit for workers facing unemployment were eventually replaced by the \"Emergency Response Benefit,\" which will give $2,000 a month for up to four months for workers who lose their income due to COVID-19.\n\nA spokesperson for the Canadian minister of finance’s office directed us to a press release detailing the new and more generous benefit, which was enacted into law on March 25.\n\nThe $2,000 per month is roughly the same as $950 every two weeks. But again, it will only apply to workers who lose income due to the coronavirus. It won’t apply to \"each family.\"\n\nA government webpage detailing Canada’s efforts to support individuals outlines the emergency response benefit, the six-month moratorium placed on student loans and the flexibility provided to borrowers who need to defer up to six monthly mortgage payments.\n\nA Facebook post said: \"All schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notif(ied) to suspend mortgage payments for at least six months, and student loans deferred.\"\n\nThe post is right about mortgage payments and student loans.

But NHS Digital, which collects the figures, doesn’t know the extent of that double counting and the figure doesn’t factor in how many of these registrations will be from people who only stayed for a short period.\n\nAnd it doesn’t come from the Lancet, it comes from data collected by NHS Digital and published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nWho is counted in that 6.5 million?\n\nThere were 6.5 million GP registrations between 2007 and 2017 in England and Wales, where the person’s previous address was recorded as being outside of the UK and it was the first time they were registering for a GP here.\n\nBut those records don’t always accurately show whether someone’s previous address was outside the UK.\n\nThe records of these GP registrations have something called a “flag 4” attached. That is intended to mean the person signing up to the GP surgery was previously living overseas. For example they may have been born outside of the UK, entered England or Wales for the first time and then registered at an NHS GP. Similar information is collected in Northern Ireland but data for Scotland is unavailable.\n\nNHS Digital told us that until March 2016, “it was possible for a patient to be registered in one area as flag 4 then move to another area and be registered again as a flag 4”, so migrants who moved around may have been double counted.\n\nNHS Digital also told us that until 2016 if a UK citizen had left the UK for more than three months then came back and registered with a new GP in England and Wales, they would also be counted as a flag 4.\n\nThe ONS says: “A person may register with a GP if they are staying in the UK for at least three months and so flag 4s may include some short-term migrants, which are not included in the population estimates.” Short-term migration is defined as between a three and 12 month stay for work or study.\n\nBecause of that, this measure is not a very good way of finding out how much the population has grown because of immigration.\n\nOther measures suggest fewer than 6.5 million people have migrated here for the long-term between 2007 and 2017\n\nLooking at long-term migration, if you add up the difference between the estimated number of non-British people who arrived in or left the UK in the ten years ending June 2018, it’s about three million. Although because of issues with the data up to 2011, that figure is likely to be an underestimate.\n\nThis is a completely different measure to GP registrations, and looks at a larger area (the UK, rather than England and Wales) and a slightly different time period (the ten years up to June 2018 rather than the ten years up to 2017), than the GP registrations figure did.\n\nWe’ve not counted short-term migration in that, because each year more short-term visits are made from the UK abroad than to England and Wales. That’s been the case since at least 2004.\n\nA different measure also makes the 6.5 million figure look too steep. Looking at the UK population by nationality, the number of non-British residents has grown by an estimated 2.2 million between 2007 and 2017. This figure comes from a survey of UK households, and there’s also reason to think this may be a slight underestimate.\n\nWhere did the link to the Lancet come from?\n\nThe 6.5 million figure has nothing to do with the Lancet medical journal. We think the confusion comes from a misunderstanding about a tweet from Migration Watch last year. The tweet said: “The decade 2007-17 saw almost 6.5 million new migrant GP registrations. The Lancet medical journal reported (2016) that, \"English primary care as currently delivered could be reaching saturation point.\" The correlation is clear. This level of immigration is unsustainable”.\n\nOther Twitter users later said that the 6.5 million figure came from the Lancet, which is incorrect.\n\nMigration Watch were quoting an article published in the Lancet about the workload of GPs and nurses in England, which doesn’t mention migrants.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"6.5 million migrants registering with UK GPs over a decade could pose a serious challenge to our NHS—shocking numbers to be considered!\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Experts warn: 6.5 million migrant GP registrations in the UK in the past 10 years might be unsustainable for our NHS!\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Did you know 6.5 million migrants have reportedly registered with UK GPs in the last decade?

Former special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony before Congress had pundits trying to answer that question.\n\nOn the July 25 episode of \"Fox & Friends,\" host Ainsley Earhardt said news reports that said Trump could be indicted after leaving office were \"not factually correct\" because they didn’t take into account a correction Mueller made to his testimony.\n\n\"He corrected himself and he said something about, ‘we couldn’t come up with a determination,’ which means that they couldn’t find a crime,\" Earhardt said. \"But if you watched ABC, if you watched CBS, if you watched NBC, ABC said that Trump could still face criminal charges after he leaves office. That’s not necessarily true.\"\n\nHowever, \"true\" is the exact word Mueller used when asked if Trump could be charged after his presidency, and the former special counsel’s correction was about something totally different.\n\n\"A president can be indicted when he leaves office, I know that,\" Earhardt said on air the next day. \"I was questioning whether this president will be indicted based on the Mueller report.\"\n\nSince the topic involves speculation about future legal issues, we decided not to rate Earhardt’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. But there’s clearly some confusion over whether Trump could be prosecuted once his time in the White House ends, so we wanted to step in with the facts.\n\nThe bottom line: Mueller testified twice that a president could be indicted after leaving office, and the four legal experts we spoke to all agreed.\n\nWhat Mueller said about charges after office\n\nThroughout his testimony, Mueller made it clear that Trump the president could not be indicted. But Trump the citizen, like all ex-presidents, is a different story.\n\nHere’s Mueller’s first exchange on the matter, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.:\n\nNadler: \"Under Department of Justice policy, the president could be prosecuted for obstruction of justice crimes after he leaves office, correct?\"\n\nHere’s the second exchange, with Rep. Ken Buck, R-Co.:\n\nBuck: \"Okay, but could you charge the president with a crime after he left office?\"\n\nBuck: \"You believe that he committed — you could charge the president of the United States with obstruction of justice after he left office?\"\n\nMueller: \"I'm not certain because I haven't looked at the ethical standards, but the OLC opinion says that the prosecutor, while he cannot bring a charge against a sitting president, nonetheless he can continue the investigation to see if there are any other persons who might be drawn into the conspiracy.\"\n\nNotably, while Mueller said Trump could face charges after he leaves office, he did not say that the president should face charges.\n\nLegal experts we spoke to agreed with Mueller.\n\n\"Once a president is out of office, the primary reasons to avoid prosecution — deference to impeachment and the need to avoid distraction of the chief executive from his or her important duties — both evaporate,\" said Mark Osler, professor of law at the University of St. Thomas.\n\nArguments based on the president’s \"supposed position at the top of the prosecutorial hierarchy\" also lose force for ex-presidents, said Cornell University law professor Josh Chafetz.\n\nDiane Marie Amann, professor of law at the University of Georgia, pointed out that even the Justice Department ruling that says a sitting president cannot be indicted includes a line specifying that the prohibition fades when he or she leaves office.\n\n\"The constitutional structure permits a sitting president to be subject to criminal process only after he leaves office or is removed therefrom through the impeachment process,\" it says.\n\nEarhardt and others — including Trump himself — confused Mueller’s remarks about Trump being charged after his presidency with other comments Mueller later corrected.\n\nBut Mueller made one correction to his testimony, and it had nothing to do with whether Trump could be charged once he’s out of the White House.\n\nThe correction addressed Mueller’s response to a question from Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., when the former special counsel seemed to suggest Trump would have been indicted were it not for the Justice Department’s ruling that says a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\nHere’s the exchange between Lieu and Mueller:\n\nLieu: \"The reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of (Office of Legal Counsel) opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?\"\n\nOn its face, Mueller’s answer implied that the OLC ruling was the only reason Trump was not indicted. But that’s not what his team has said in the report or in public statements.\n\nLater, Mueller clarified his response. He said:\n\n\"I want to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. Lieu, who said, and I quote, ‘You didn't charge the president because of the OLC opinion.’\n\nThat is not the correct way to say it.

The broadcast was anchored by journalist Rahul Kanwal.\n\nSince January 12, a 20-second clip of Kanwal began circulating on social media with a claim that he said chanting ‘Vande Mataram’ is anti-national. BJP’s Mumbai spokesperson Suresh Nakhua posted the video with the message, “So, @rahulkanwal of @IndiaToday says ” Chanting Vande Mataram is anti national”. Now let’s see how Rahul spins this one.” At the time of writing this article, Nakhua’s tweet garnered over 6,500 retweets.\n\nInterestingly, Nakhua had tweeted the same clip in February 2016 with a similar narrative. At the time, the tweet had gathered close to 120 retweets.\n\nNational media in-charge of J&K BJP youth wing BJYM Rohit Chahal posted the same video with the message, “According to @rahulkanwal singing Vande Mataram is Anti National activity ! #RahulKanwalExposed”.\n\nSaurabh Khamar, a member with BJP Andhra’s social media & IT cell, who flaunts a profile picture with PM Modi, tweeted a video of crowding chanting Vande Mataram and took a jibe at Kanwal. “Can we file anti nationals charge sheets on this 30k People @rahulkanwal ???”, reads his tweet.\n\nRahul Kanwal responded to the viral claim via a tweet. “Here’s what happened. @indiatoday SIT exposed lawyers who accepted on camera they bashed up Kanhaiya in court while cops watched. Lawyers attacking Kanhaiya chanted Vande Mataram. To attack someone and chant Vande Mataram is anti-national. Said it then, will say it now. Jai Hind,” the journalist wrote.\n\nWith a relevant keyword search on India Today’s YouTube channel, Alt News found that the viral video is part of a February 17, 2016 broadcast. “Groups of unruly lawyers yet again displayed hooliganism outside the Patiala Court, attacking Kanhaiya Kumar as the JNUSU president was brought in,” reads its description.\n\nKanwal was moderating a discussion where advocate Rajeev Yadav was one of the guests. In 2016, when the top court was hearing the JNU sedition row, Yadav shouted ‘Vande Mataram’ inside the courtroom and was chided by the bench. The lawyer was escorted out by security officials and had to submit an unconditional apology before the Supreme Court for his actions.\n\nDuring the India Today debate, Yadav defended his sloganeering. He believed that the lawyers defending former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar were representing a “traitor”, to which Kanwal responded, “But for this reason, there are judges. A judge will decide which issue is right, which lawyer is wrong. You are arguing that in the court. You argue with Prashant Bhushan in the court. Why are you raising slogans like this? Why are you are doing the anti-national activity? Why are you doing the anti-legal activity? I allege that what you did is anti-national. The slogans of Vande Mataram, you raised, is anti-national activity.”\n\nKanwal’s reply to Yadav’s argument that chanting Vande Mataram is not anti-national was, “to raise [slogans] inside the court, is to spoil the dignity of the Supreme Court. It’s totally wrong. It hurts the dignity of this country. Your act is wrong.”\n\nA 20-second bit from the complete discussion was clipped to take out the context and portray Rahul Kanwal as against the slogan of ‘Vande Mataram’ when in fact he was suggesting that sloganeering inside a courtroom is unacceptable.\n\nSwarajya columnist Shefali Vaidya and former Shiv Sena member Ramesh Solanki also tweeted the clip with the false narrative. Their tweets have garnered a combined retweet count of nearly 3,600.\n\nIAS officer Sanjay Dixit also quote-tweeted the same video and opined, “Rahul Uvach: @rahulkanwal loftily declares Vande Mataram to be anti-National. In Khilafat 1.0, even Muslim leadership regarded it as national, but 100 years down the line, the ‘sickular’ media finds it anti-National. Khilafat 2.0 is being led by such disgusting specimens!”.\n\nMany other people on Facebook and Twitter have shared the clipped video.\n\nIt may be reiterated that journalist Rahul Kanwal did not say that chanting ‘Vande Mataram’ is anti-national but sloganeering in the court of law is anti-national and anti-legal.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: @rahulkanwal allegedly calls singing Vande Mataram anti-national activity! #RahulKanwalExposed 🤯😲\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you hear?

Well, it just turns out, it just so happens that Monica McLean worked for a Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, now a virulent anti-Trump critic on television and former counsel to Chuck Schumer.

Laufman, wrote in an email: “As a supervisory special agent assigned to the press office of the FBI’s New York Division in 2008-2009, Monica McLean was responsible for coordinating news releases with the press office of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (USAO-SDNY).

{"query_id": 1.167744454419202e+18, "query": "(THREAD) Some initial analysis of recent spending announcements on schools and 16-18 education[1/8]", "target": "Is schools spending going to be at record levels?\n\nEarlier this month we wrote about a claim made by the government that spending on primary and secondary schools in England will increase by £14 billion over the next three years.\n\nWe said that, while it’s not technically inaccurate, it may well be misleading because it adds up multiple years of spending increases. This isn’t how people normally talk about spending increases, and it makes the figure seem comparatively much larger than it really is.\n\nLast week the figure was used again in an ad campaign run by the Conservative Party (the ads have been deactivated following a separate article we wrote about how they seemed to alter the headline of a BBC news article).\n\nAs well as repeating the £14 billion claim, the ads made two new factual claims: that this is a “record” amount, and that this is “levelling up per pupil funding across the country”.\n\nThe proposed spending increase is not a record amount when you take into account inflation and rising pupil numbers (which is the most meaningful measure). Per pupil spending will increase to roughly the level it was at in 2009/10.\n\nIf you don’t adjust for pupil numbers, it’s hard to say whether or not the spending increase is a “record”, because we don’t have good historical data. It’s unclear exactly what the Conservative Party meant when it said “record” and we’ve asked it for more information.\n\nWhat spending has been pledged?\n\nThe Conservatives outlined spending increases in schools in England which total £14 billion over three years.\n\nThis £14 billion figure isn’t the most helpful way of looking at the numbers and is potentially misleading for a few reasons.\n\nFor one, it does not account for inflation. Also, it adds together all of the increases in spending for every year between now and 2022/23 (so the increase between 2019/20 and 2020/21, as well as 2019/20 and 2021/22, and so on.) The standard practice for discussing spending changes is to talk about them on a per year basis.\n\nOnce you factor these things in, spending will be £4.3 billion higher in 2022/23 than in 2019/20 in real terms. The IFS told us that’s roughly a 10% increase over the three years on schools spending.\n\nEven this figure isn’t a perfect way of looking at school spending. It doesn’t account for rising pupil numbers. As pupil numbers increase over time, the most meaningful way of looking at school spending is the amount spent “per pupil”.\n\nSo the best measure to use is real-terms per-pupil spending. The IFS has said that, by this measure, schools spending is going to rise by around 7.4% per pupil by 2022/23.\n\nThe IFS said “Since 2009-10, school spending per pupil has fallen by 8% in real-terms in England. The new spending plans should be near enough sufficient to reverse these cuts by 2022-23. In addition, the government is continuing to provide compensation to schools for higher pension contributions on top of this.\n\n“This package represents a large increase in spending per pupil, taking it back to about the same level it was in 2009-10. However, a 13-year period of no net growth in school spending per pupil, after inflation, still represents a significant squeeze on school budgets when considered in historical terms.”\n\nThe term “record” could mean that the increase in spending is larger than schools have ever been given over a comparable time frame.\n\nThere is no good consistent data to judge school spending over time, so it’s hard to say whether or not £4.3 billion is the largest ever increase over three years.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, the best measure of school funding is the amount in real terms per pupil. Although the planned increase will be “large” as the IFS put it, it won’t be a record. Spending per pupil rose by 13.6% between 2004/05 and 2007/08. This was also a larger increase in absolute terms per pupil.\n\nWhat else could \"record\" mean?\n\nAlternatively, “record” could mean that following the government’s planned spending increases up to 2022/23 the total schools budget will be larger than they’ve ever been before.\n\nThat’s technically correct, but not very meaningful. It isn’t unusual for government budgets to get bigger year-on-year, as they tend to go up over time as overall spending increases and, in the case of schools, pupil numbers increase.\n\nTo get a better sense of how far that money can go we need to look at schools spending accounting for inflation and the spending per pupil.\n\nAs we’ve touched on, analysis published by the IFS shows that the per pupil spend in 2022/23 will be almost at 2009/10 levels, though not quite as high. 2009/10 saw the highest per pupil spend in any year since 2003/04, which is the furthest back the IFS were able to analyse comparable figures.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Incredible news!

We don’t know who that person is, but we hope he’s identified and held accountable for his actions. Our officer? He’s been working hard, keeping people and property safe, and protecting the right to peacefully assemble. It’s sad that people would post and share this untrue information, adding more confusion to an already painful time in our community.\n\nOn June 7, 2020, the Saint Paul Police Department released more information about Pederson’s whereabouts during the incident, including a surveillance video which supposedly showed the officer at another location at the time the Autozone windows were smashed.\n\n“We knew right away that our officer was not involved in instigating the unrest in Minneapolis because we knew exactly where he was at the time—and he was in Saint Paul. Unfortunately, some people continue to spread the lie—either out of genuine concern, a lack of knowledge about the situation, or maliciousness—so we’ve taken the extraordinary step of releasing the video that shows exactly where the officer was. “This type of disinformation can jeopardize the officer’s reputation and safety and chip away at the trust this police department has worked so hard to build with its community.”\n\nAs it stands, scant evidence exists to support the claim that the man seen in the video dressed in black and smashing the windows of an AutoZone was Pederson, or indeed that it was even a police officer. For starters, the person’s face in the video is covered by a mask that simply makes him impossible to identify. We’ve also seen dozens of similar rumors over the years that misidentified people because they had a passing resemblance to another person. Just this week, we saw rumors that falsely identified Derek Chauvin, the officer identified as kneeling on Floyd’s neck before he died, as a man at a rally for U.S. President Donald Trump, and as a man wearing a “Make Whites Great Again” hat.\n\nThe evidence to support the claim that he is a police officer named Jacob Pederson is scant, and the St. Paul Police Department has issued a statement denying that one of its officers is seen in this video. However, as the identify of the “umbrella man” in this video is still unknown, we can’t rule out that this person was a different undercover police officer and have therefore marked this article as unproven.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: There are claims circulating on social media wrongly identifying one of our officers as the person filmed breaking windows in Minneapolis.

One of them, #Lebanon, is as big as Devon &amp; Cornwall combined.", "target": "Refugees in Lebanon and the UK\n\nA tweet posted this morning says that Lebanon is the size of Devon and Cornwall combined, and that it shelters 1,500,000 refugees to the UK’s 150,000.\n\nThe first part of this claim has done the rounds on social media before and is accurate: Lebanon is 10,400 km², while the combined area of the traditional counties Devon and Cornwall is 10,270 km².\n\nThe second part is trickier.\n\nLebanon hosts just over a million Syrian refugees, according to the United Nations.\n\nThis is in addition to around half a million other refugees, most of them Palestinians, who are registered with a separate UN agency. That figure is disputed, however, with recent research indicating that only around half that number are actually in the country.\n\nIt’s also complicated to work out the ‘refugee’ population of the UK. The Home Office told us that it doesn’t keep a running total.\n\nThe UN gives a figure of 123,000 refugees in the UK, plus 46,000 people with an asylum application being processed. Last year, it was 117,000 plus 36,000 pending applications—which may be the source of the claim that there are 150,000 refugees living here.\n\nBut as there’s no definitive number for refugees in the UK, there are other ways this could be calculated.\n\nThe UN gets its figure by counting the number of people who have been granted asylum in the past 10 years. People who were accepted as refugees more than 10 years ago don’t appear as ‘refugees’ in its statistics.\n\nRefugees can apply to become British citizens after six years. It seems reasonable to stop describing people as refugees after 10 years, as the circumstances of people in the UK for a decade or longer will often be very different to those fleeing recent persecution.\n\nFor many of Lebanon’s refugees, there is no similar path to citizenship. Its large Palestinian refugee population is made up of people who fled Israel/Palestine after the war of 1948—as well as subsequent conflicts, notably the Six Day War—and their descendants.\n\nThese Palestinian refugees generally can’t get Lebanese citizenship. They have “limited access to government services,” according to the UN, and “have to depend almost entirely on [the UN] for basic services”. They can’t own their own home and many still live in refugee camps.\n\nSo there are Palestinians who have lived in Lebanon for decades, or were in fact born there, who still qualify as refugees legally and live lifestyles similar in many respects to people who have fled persecution more recently.\n\nThat complicates the comparison with the UK, which has no equivalent population. Refugees who have arrived in the UK since World War Two will have eventually been absorbed as citizens.\n\nNone of this to deny Lebanon has a great number of refugees. Even allowing for some variation in the figures, it hosts more refugees per head than any other country: 1 for every 4 Lebanese citizens. The equivalent for the UK, based on the figures above, would at its maximum be 1 in 380.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Five countries are home to nearly all Syrian refugees—95%!

That’s correct for the UK, according to data from the Department of Health and Social Care. He was also correct to say that is the lowest since lockdown began on 24 March.\n\nTechnically this is the number of deaths that were reported in the 24 hours to 5pm on 31 May.\n\nMr Hancock also said 39,045 people had died overall, and his presentation slides at the time showed the same. But as the post we’re checking claims, in the briefing the day before, the cumulative total was reported at the time as 38,489. The difference between these figures is 556, and not 111.\n\nThe reason for this discrepancy is that the total figure was updated between these two briefings, to include additional deaths from late April and May.\n\n445 lab-confirmed Covid-19 case deaths were added to the total by 1 June\n\nIn the notes section of its coronavirus cases guidance, the government said: “The cumulative totals for deaths have been revised to include an additional 445 deaths.\n\n“These additional deaths are from the period 26 April to 31 May. The daily total today is unaffected.\n\n“Our published daily series has been revised to show when these deaths were reported.”\n\nIn the small print in the data release for the 1 June press briefing, it says that the additional 445 deaths were just in England, and from the period 24 April to 31 May. We checked with the Department for Health and Social Care, and it said that the small print should have said 26 April to 31 May.\n\nIt goes on to say:\n\n“Figures still relate to those who have died, in any setting, having had a positive lab confirmed test. As the testing programme expands, work has been conducted to integrate individual level data on laboratory confirmed cases for Pillar 2 (commercial partner testing) into the central repository of laboratory results that [Public Health England] uses. This additional data flow has enabled PHE to incorporate the matching of additional laboratory confirmed cases, from Pillar 2, into their process, thereby increasing the number of deaths for which a positive, confirmed test exists. PHE have revised their daily series to show when these deaths were reported.)”\n\nSo the extra deaths come from fatal cases confirmed to have Covid-19 by labs not operated by the NHS or Public Health England. We asked the Department for Health and Social Care whether any more of this data will continue to be updated with backlogged fatalities and a spokesperson told us: \"All deaths before 24 May 2020 of people who tested positive through 'pillar 2' testing are included in the reported daily figure for 24 May 2020.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Matt Hancock boasted the death toll increased by just 111—the 'lowest since lockdown'—but total deaths actually jumped by 556! 😳 #downingstreetbriefings\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Unbelievable: Matt Hancock's numbers claim a rise of 111 deaths, yet the actual increase was 556, the biggest since May 12th!\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Reportedly, Matt Hancock announced only 111 new deaths, despite the total rising by 556 after adding lab-confirmed results! 🤔 #downingstreetbriefings\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Incredible discrepancy!

Can you verify please?\n\nIn March 2016 the above-reproduced meme, which showed Mark Cuban talking about Donald Trump, started once again showing up in social media. It quoted Cuban as saying:\n\nWhile Cuban did actually say this, his comment was made in July 2015. The platform on which Cuban made the remarks was purportedly made via Cyber Dust (an app created by Cuban that automatically deletes messages) which made subsequent verification difficult. A full and slightly longer comment could be found on a 28 July 2015 Washington Post article:\n\nSubsequent comments referenced by Cuban on his Facebook page led to a dead link, but a Business Insider article quoted the entrepreneur’s commentary on the state of the Republican party:\n\n“I would prefer to be a Republican,” Cuban wrote in the post, which was flagged by The Dallas Morning News. “I want smaller government. I want smarter government. Just like most Republicans. Put aside that I disagree with Republicans on most social issues. The Republicans have a much bigger problem that will crush them in every presidential election until this changes.” Cuban lamented that those who disagree with the “consensus” were called fake Republicans. “The Republican Party requires that all their presidential candidates conform to consensus,” he said. “If you don’t agree with every platform of the party, not only are you called a RINO, a ‘Republican in Name Only.’ You are considered unelectable in primaries and become a source of scorn on Fox News. That’s a problem.”\n\nHowever, on 12 February 2016, Cuban told Bloomberg Markets he believed he would be a better president than Trump. The Hill transcribed some of the remarks, in which Cuban said Trump was better suited to the private sector and assessed the millennial appeal of Bernie Sanders:\n\nBusinessman Mark Cuban says he would make a better president than Republican primary front-runner Donald Trump. “Should I be in Donald Trump’s position? I think I’d do a better job,” the tech magnate and owner of the Dallas Mavericks said Friday on “Bloomberg Markets.” Cuban also said surging Dem presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders is appealing to millennials. He said that while younger voters have an entrepreneurial streak, they also care about social issues. “I think this is part of the attraction of Bernie Sanders, because you would think, ‘Why are kids so into somebody who’s a self-proclaimed socialist? … when you look at the most successful companies … inevitably, and I’ve invested in many of these companies, they have a social component to what they do,” he added, citing companies like Toms Shoes, which donates a portion of their profits.\n\nCuban’s February 2016 remarks led some to poll him against Trump in a hypothetical election. Cuban retweeted:\n\nThe link led to an article on the web site CivicScience:\n\nBefore I type another word, I need to disclose that Mark Cuban is a formal advisor to CivicScience and a mentor to me personally. I also know that the odds of Mark running for President this year are near-zero. None of that stopped me from exploring the concept … After hearing the Bloomberg comments, we launched a nationwide survey of 2,061 U.S. adults, pitting Cuban and Trump against one another in a hypothetical presidential election. [Suffice] to say, Donald Trump is fortunate that Mark Cuban or someone like him isn’t in the race. These numbers show a potential head-to-head race that isn’t even close. Cuban would win comfortably. When we dug into the demographics, the reasons are pretty clear. Cuban beats Trump handily among self-identified Liberals (78%-22%), women, anyone under age 45, minorities, urban dwellers, and people with a college degree or higher. He wins among self-identified “Independents” by 10 points.\n\nIt’s true that Mark Cuban made the statement attributed to him in this meme, but the remarks occurred several months before they circulated and originally appeared on a mostly closed app, Cyber Dust. Cuban, since then, has opined that he would make a better president than Trump (going so far as to post the results of a subsequent poll about that very matchup), and also made favorable remarks about Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news!

I take them for their word.", "target": "The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that there are enough COVID-19 tests for states to begin reopening their economies. While that may be true for select locations, experts say more tests are needed, even if they don’t agree on a particular number.\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, President Donald Trump and other members of the coronavirus task force have insisted that there are adequate levels of diagnostic testing for the coronavirus to allow states to lift stay-at-home orders and restart some businesses.\n\n“We are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity and confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening,” Trump said in an April 27 briefing, adding, “And the testing is not going to be a problem at all. In fact, it’s going to be one of the great assets that we have.”\n\nIn the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence said, “[W]e have a sufficient amount of testing today for every state that qualifies to enter phase one to begin to reopen their economies.” Phase one refers to the first part of the White House’s plan for a gradual return to quasi-normal life, which allows gyms, restaurants and movie theaters, for example, to open under continued social distancing, but for schools to remain closed and workplaces to encourage telework where possible.\n\nThe vice president’s office did not explain which metrics Pence and others were using to make that determination, so it’s hard to fully evaluate his statement. But while some places may have enough tests, multiple scientists told us that as a whole, the U.S. still lags behind what’s needed to execute an effective strategy to rein in outbreaks.\n\n“Testing is still limited,” Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in response to Pence’s statement.\n\n“If you’re not including testing as a large part of phase one opening, then sure, we have plenty of tests,” he said. “But I think most of us who are working on thinking about what are the safest and best ways to open up the economy again place pretty significant amounts of testing front and center to prevent outbreaks and monitor for them.”\n\nThe question of how many tests it will take is hotly debated, with some groups recommending at least around half a million tests a day, and others suggesting several million or upwards of 20 million or even 35 million a day.\n\nAccording to the COVID Tracking Project, testing for the coronavirus in the U.S. has steadily improved — to around 264,000 a day, on average over the past week, up from about 217,000 tests per day on average for the week ending on April 26. But the nation is still below any of the proposed benchmarks from experts.\n\nThose figures also mean there aren’t enough tests for every American who wants to return to work to get one, as Trump suggested in a May 5 interview with ABC News. When asked whether “any worker who’s nervous about going back” would have access to both diagnostic tests for the virus and antibody, or serological tests, “right now,” Trump replied, “There should be no problem.”\n\nBut Yonatan Grad, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard, said the answer “is quite clearly no,” adding, “we don’t yet have the capacity to offer broadly either virologic or serologic testing.”\n\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci told CNN’s Jake Tapper on April 28 that everyone who needs a test, “according to the way we’re approaching the identification, isolation, contact tracing, keeping the country safe and healthy,” should be able to get one by the end of May or the beginning of June.\n\n“That’s what I’m being told by the people who are responsible for the testing,” he added. “I take them for their word.”\n\nWe’ll review several of the estimates and explain why testing is so important — but also why it’s not the only consideration for reopening businesses, schools and other places that have been largely closed for a month or more.\n\nSeveral groups have attempted to put a figure on how many tests are needed for the U.S. to reopen. On the lower end, researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute calculated that the U.S. would need to do approximately 500,000 tests per day, as a bare minimum, by May 1 — a figure they have since revised to 900,000 for May 15.\n\nOn the other extreme, there’s Nobel laureate and New York University economist Paul Romer’s plan to test the entire U.S. population once every two weeks, or around 25 million tests a day. He has since raised that to 35 million tests per day, or more, to include daily testing of front-line workers.\n\nIn between, Harvard University’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics suggests 2 million tests per day to start, then ramping up to at least 5 million tests per day by early June to get the full workforce back in action — with that growing to as many as 20 million tests per day.\n\nThe 5-million-a-day figure has received perhaps the most attention, in part because when asked about the number on April 28, the president claimed the U.S. would hit that goal “very soon.”\n\nThat morning, however, Adm. Brett Giroir, who is in charge of the government’s COVID-19 testing efforts, told Time magazine that “there is absolutely no way on Earth, on this planet or any other planet, that we can do 20 million tests a day, or even five million tests a day.”\n\nA day later, Trump insisted that he had never made such a claim. “I think we will,” he said, referring to hitting the 5-million-per-day benchmark, “but I never said it.”\n\nThere isn’t a consensus on the number of tests, in part because the groups are making different assumptions and taking different approaches to tackling the pandemic on different timelines. Key to all of the strategies, however, is using testing to identify people who are infected so that they can be isolated and no longer spread the virus to others.\n\nMany public health experts endorse testing combined with contact tracing, which involves tracking down others with whom the infected person had contact, so that those people can be warned, and ideally be put into quarantine or be tested as well.\n\n“Without ubiquitous testing — testing everyone with symptoms, and those they have come in contact with — we simply cannot be confident that a reported decline in cases represents a true decline in infections – and that it’s safe to open,” explained Ashish Jha, faculty director of Harvard Global Health Institute, or HGHI, and a co-author of the group’s estimates, in a Time editorial. “If a state misjudges its true underlying infection trajectory, it may suffer large flare-ups of the disease, necessitating a long and painful lockdown again.”\n\nThe HGHI estimates were calculated in two main ways. In the first, the team followed a strategy of testing everyone with flu-like symptoms and the contacts of those who test positive. Assuming that 1% of cases prove fatal, the group worked backward from a projected number of deaths to estimate the number of new infections in the U.S. on a given day, which for May 15, is about 100,000. To then approximate the number of tests, the group assumed that three-fourths of those people would have symptoms and be tested, and each person would have 10 contacts to trace.\n\nThomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher on the HGHI team, told us the team looked through the literature to determine the number of contacts, and ended up choosing a “middle-of-the-road estimate.”\n\nThen the group added in the typical number of influenza-like illness cases for the season, reaching a total of around 900,000 tests per day. A similar calculation, based on trying to get the percentage of positive tests below 10% — in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization — produced a similar figure.\n\nThe researchers, however, caution that their approach in every way veers toward an undercount, and therefore should be viewed as a “floor, not a goal.”\n\n“If we don’t ramp up our testing,” said Tsai, “we’re just condemned to repeating the mistakes of both February, March and April.”\n\nThe Harvard Safra figures, which were based on modeling efforts described in two white papers, assume an intensive testing, isolation and contact tracing approach.\n\nDanielle Allen, the director of the center and co-author of the group’s April 20 report, told us the numbers were generated by aiming to have each infected person spread the disease to less than one other person (specifically 0.75 people), which would allow the outbreak to eventually fizzle out.\n\nWith just essential workers, or about 40% of the workforce in action, the group estimated the U.S. would need 2 million tests per day, rising to 5 million for 100% of the workforce.\n\n“Both of these numbers depend on effective contact tracing,” Allen said. “If contact tracing is moderately effective the amount of testing needed rises to 20 million a day.”\n\nAllen, however, said that with subsequent modeling, the group now thinks 5 million tests per day may be sufficient, and is planning to revise the numbers in a forthcoming report.\n\nTwo other groups, also adopting a contact tracing strategy, offer other testing benchmarks. The Rockefeller Foundation suggests an initial 3 million tests per week, or about 430,000 tests per day, by mid-June, then growing that number 10-fold over another six months.\n\nResolve to Save Lives, a public health initiative headed by former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden, tallied up the number of highest-priority people who need tests, and came up with a lower bound number of 350,000 to 700,000 tests per day. This includes high-risk patients with COVID-19 symptoms and any sick hospital workers, public safety officers, prisoners, or nursing home residents and their symptomatic contacts.\n\n“The minimum number of tests that need to be done per day,” the group’s report notes, “will depend on the stage of the epidemic and number of outbreaks, hospitalization rates, number of cases and contacts identified, and decisions about the frequency and extent of testing in nursing homes, hospitals, and essential services.”\n\nIf contact tracing is not part of the equation, even more tests are needed because the approach becomes an untargeted national surveillance method. Because diagnostic testing only reveals whether someone has detectable virus in their body at one point in time, tests must be given to pretty much everyone repeatedly to ensure those who are infected are aware and can be isolated.\n\nThat’s how one arrives at the even higher figures, such as Romer’s 25-million-per-day goal. Instead of prioritizing people who are sick, as is being done now — and is recommended in the vast majority of proposals — Romer’s plan calls for tests to go first to people without symptoms to pick out those who are spreading the virus unwittingly.\n\nWhile most of the test estimates are for the entire country, the reality is that for any targeted testing strategy — which is the only strategy that’s currently possible — locations with relatively few infections won’t need as much testing as places with huge outbreaks.\n\n“You can’t just take the national number and scale it to states by their population,” HGHI’s Jha told the health news website STAT, in a story sharing an updated state-by-state breakdown of the group’s original estimate. “You have to base it on the size of the outbreak in a state.”\n\nThe latest figures from HGHI show that just nine states, the majority of which are clustered in the sparsely-populated West, are close to or have surpassed their testing targets. The analysis also reveals that even states that have been performing a large number of tests per capita, such as Rhode Island and Massachusetts, are still short of their estimated minimums. Conversely, some states that have relatively low per-capita testing rates, such as Hawaii and Alaska, are exceeding their targets.\n\nBecause the estimates were made using a model that assumed states would stay locked down until May 15, the researchers caution that states could very well need more tests than their calculations suggest if social distancing measures are loosened.\n\n“The moment you relax, the number of cases will start climbing,” Jha noted in the group’s write-up of the project. “And therefore, the number of tests you need to keep your society, your state from having large outbreaks will also start climbing.”\n\nNone of the other estimates provide state-level figures, although Allen said the Harvard Safra group plans to release another report breaking down its national numbers “to make visible what is necessary in high prevalence, low prevalence, and no prevalence locales.”\n\nShort of a specific test threshold, one metric experts say can get at whether a country or state is doing something close to enough testing is the test positivity rate.\n\nCaitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told us that it’s “very difficult to say what the ‘right’ number” of tests is, but because a high fraction of tests are still positive, “it is clear we need more capacity.”\n\nAs a Johns Hopkins website explains, if a large proportion of tests are positive, that suggests a community is only able to test the sickest patients, and is likely missing people with milder infections who can still spread the disease.\n\nThe WHO has said that countries doing extensive testing see around 3-12% of tests come back positive, and has recommended that nations aim for or a test positivity of roughly 10% to make sure there’s enough testing happening to detect all of the cases.\n\nAs of May 8, about 15% of all tests in the U.S. have been positive, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. In the last few days, the current test positivity rate has begun to dip below 10%, although many states have a significantly higher percentage of positive tests.\n\n“I prefer positivity to numbers of tests or tests per capita because positivity is tied to the burden of disease in a location,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in an email.\n\nNuzzo noted, for example, that the U.S. has conducted around 10 times as many tests per capita as Taiwan, but the American epidemic is some 200 times bigger.\n\nAnd she has concerns about many states that are thinking of or have already reopened. “[W]e’ve found that a number of these [states] aren’t doing enough testing and have too high positivities,” she said. “This makes me worried that they are missing the bottom of the iceberg in terms of infections and not seeing the full picture of illness in their communities.”\n\nJeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, agreed that per-capita test numbers are “not as informative as looking at testing per positive infection identified.”\n\nThe U.S., he said, has done only about six tests per confirmed case, whereas South Korea has done 60. “They’re testing 10 times as many per infection found,” he said in an interview.\n\nThis is especially relevant because Trump has frequently boasted of the total number of tests the U.S. has performed, and has suggested that the U.S. is outpacing South Korea and other nations.\n\nSpeaking in Arizona on May 5, Trump said, “We’re over 7 million tests. Germany is at two and a half. Italy is less than that. Japan is down here and South Korea, which we talk about, and again, I’m very friendly with South Korea, and with the president of South Korea, and he calls to congratulate us on our great testing. South Korea is over here.”\n\nTrump is correct that the U.S. has done more total testing, but all of the other countries he mentioned have still performed more tests per positive case, meaning they’ve been able to do more testing relative to the size of their outbreaks.\n\nThe next day, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany again referenced South Korea. “We always hear about South Korea and their tests, there are 11 tests per thousand,” she said. “Here in the United States, that’s 17 tests per thousand.”\n\nMcEnany’s statistics are slightly off — for May 4, Our World in Data shows South Korea with 12 tests per thousand people and the U.S. with 22.\n\nBut again, the comparison is misleading because it ignores the fact, as we have previously written, that South Korea rapidly expanded testing early on in the outbreak. Ultimately, the country was able to successfully halt its outbreak — something the U.S. has failed to do.\n\nOn May 8, the country posted just 12 new cases, while the U.S. is still seeing around 25,000 new infections per day, or approximately 325 times more cases than South Korea when adjusted for the population. It took months — until April 17 — for the U.S. to catch up to South Korea’s per-capita testing level, and the U.S. has yet to match the nation’s less than 2% test positivity rate. South Korea doesn’t need to compete with the U.S. on per-capita tests because the country is already doing a massive amount of testing compared to its caseload.\n\nWhile experts say increased testing is a requirement for reopening, they also emphasize that by itself, it’s not enough.\n\n“What’s more important now is not so much the testing number,” said HGHI’s Tsai. “It’s really the testing strategy and transparency around the goalposts as states come up with their specific plans for reopening.”\n\nA key question is whether states will be able to snuff out new chains of viral transmission through contact tracing, as many experts advise. While a staple of public health, contact tracing is a resource-intensive process, and involves not just piecing together an infected person’s contacts, but also providing support to those who are quarantined or isolated.\n\n“They may need food. They may need medicines,” said Emily Gurley, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, on a call with journalists. “They may need help with simple things like doing their laundry.”\n\nGurley contributed to a report, written in collaboration with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, that estimated the U.S. would need to add around 100,000 contact tracers to combat the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWhile Shaman thinks contact tracing is absolutely critical, he noted that South Korea was exceptionally well set-up to make the technique more effective.\n\nFollowing an outbreak of MERS in 2015, he said, the country passed laws that allowed the government to monitor people’s credit cards and phones — and also to arrest anyone refusing to participate in a quarantine.\n\nThose levers aren’t available in the U.S., and privacy concerns may keep at bay proposals to deploy more scalable technology-based contact tracing tools.\n\nOther scientists are pessimistic that contact tracing will work in the U.S., especially if case numbers remain high.\n\n“It’s clear that you can do a lot of control if you do contact tracing really well. Singapore managed with mainly contact tracing for several months,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, in a call with reporters. “But then eventually even Singapore lost its control of the epidemic and had to resort to social distancing types of measures.”\n\n“In conjunction with really aggressive measures to get case numbers down — and significant resources — contact tracing can be a useful piece of the control approach,” he added. “But I think it’s very challenging with an ongoing epidemic.”\n\nAccording to a New York Times analysis, 21 states are planning to or have already begun to reopen, even though they have not cleared all of the criteria set forth by the White House guidelines. Most of the states do not meet the gating criteria for COVID-19 cases, which can be met by showing either a “downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period” or a “downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period.”\n\nOpening before states have solid testing infrastructures and strategies that they know are working, Tsai said, would be premature. “It’s basically just turning back the hands of time to February,” he said.\n\nFactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

As a result of that uncertainty, we received multiple inquiries from Snopes readers about the authenticity of, and context surrounding, the photograph.\n\nIn reality, the photograph was authentic, and the context and account provided by the boy’s mother — that he was forced to sleep on the floor due to the unavailability of beds — was confirmed by hospital authorities who have since apologized. Viral social media posts claiming to have proof that the photograph was staged “propaganda” were in fact themselves bogus, and part of a wave of misinformation, likely coordinated, and potentially with sinister intent.\n\nOn Dec. 8, The Yorkshire Evening Post was the first to report on the experience of 4-year-old Jack Williment-Barr after he was brought by ambulance on Dec. 3 to the infirmary with suspected pneumonia. That article included the now-famous photograph of the boy lying on coats on the floor of the hospital, covered in a blanket and with an oxygen mask.\n\nThe boy’s mother, Sarah Williment, told the Post he had been forced to wait in a clinical treatment room for four hours, and went 13 hours without access to a bed, such was the overcrowding at the hospital on that day. Hospital authorities confirmed Williment’s account and offered a personal apology to her and Jack, as the Post reported:\n\n“Our hospitals are extremely busy at the moment and we are very sorry that Jack’s family had a long wait in our Emergency Department. Our Chief Executive Julian Hartley has spoken to Jack’s mum and offered a personal apology. We have seen a significant increase in the number of people visiting our Paediatric Emergency Department, and this week we saw the highest attendances we have seen since April 2016. Despite this, our staff are working tirelessly to provide the best possible care under these extreme pressures. “Jack was quickly assessed upon arrival and seen in two different clinical treatment rooms in the Paediatric Emergency Department.Within four hours a decision was made to admit Jack to our Children’s Assessment and Treatment (CAT) Unit for further monitoring overnight. Unfortunately, the unit was also experiencing exceptionally high levels of demand which meant that Jack was required to wait in the clinical treatment room in the Paediatric Emergency Department until a bed became available. Jack was admitted to the CAT Unit later that evening and was discharged home the following morning after a medical review. “We are extremely sorry that there were only chairs available in the treatment room, and no bed. This falls below our usual high standards, and for this we would like to sincerely apologise to Jack and his family.”\n\nThe article, and in particular the photograph, quickly developed into a major national news story in the U.K., and the widely read national tabloid newspaper the Daily Mirror ran the story, with the photograph, on its front page, the following morning, along with the headline “DESPERATE — Picture that shames Tories”:\n\nWilliment-Barr’s experience also became a significant moment in the general election campaign. The opposition Labour Party had already made the National Health Service (NHS), and the ruling Conservatives’ management of it, a central plank in its election messaging. When the Leeds story broke, the party and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, seized upon it:\n\nThe damage to the Conservative Party government was exacerbated when Prime Minister Boris Johnson initially refused to look at the photograph of Williment-Barr, when presented it by a journalist, and even took the journalist’s phone and put it in his own pocket. He later looked at the photograph and apologized for taking the phone, and offered an apology to the boy’s family:\n\nThen, something strange happened. Within a day of the story’s first breaking, Facebook and Twitter were populated with a wave of posts attacking the credibility of the photograph, and claiming to have inside information from Leeds General Infirmary that showed that the image of Williment-Barr was no more than a stunt and “Momentum propaganda,” a reference to the left-wing movement within Labour, which is regarded as a reliable and vocal source of support for Corbyn’s leadership of the party.\n\nThe posts were identical, meaning they could not have been authentic. They read as follows:\n\n“Very interesting. A good friend of mine is a senior nursing sister at Leeds Hospital – the boy shown on the floor by the media was in fact put there by his mother who then took photos on her mobile phone and uploaded it to media outlets before he climbed back onto his trolley. He was on a hospital trolley in the paediatric [accident and emergency] having been seen within 20 minutes. I am a nurse myself and am so pissed off with fake news, yes the NHS is a mess mainly caused by people misusing it and lack of elderly care. Think of the nurses and Doctors who are doing their jobs instead of constantly slagging them off. another Momentum\n\n Propaganda story. Disgraceful.”\n\nOn Dec. 9 and 10, a second wave of identical posts spread on Facebook and Twitter, again seeking to undermine the credibility of Sarah Williment’s account of her son’s experience. This time, each of the posters claimed — using the exact same wording — that they themselves were “a former paediatric A&E [accident and emergency] and PICU [pediatric intensive care unit] nurse.” This second bogus post read as follows:\n\n“I’m a former paediatric A&E and PICU nurse and that child has a style of O2 mask in front of him that requires 6-8l/min to inflate like that. If a child needed that amount of O2 they’d be in resus for proper monitoring. He’d also have a cannula and be propped head up.”\n\nIt’s not clear who or what entity was behind what appears to have been two coordinated disinformation responses to the Leeds hospital photograph, but the posts were clearly intended to distract and confuse the British public, and limit the damage done to the Conservative Party, only a few days before voters went to the polls, on Dec. 12.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: A child reportedly using an O2 mask requiring 6-8l/min should be in resus!

An archived version of this tweet can be seen here. This tweet told a completely false story, saying the elephant jumped out of the truck when it heard its mahout’s call, and that an NGO was involved in the incident. Secondly, we saw that PETA had replied to the tweet claiming the group was involved in the incident, denying any role in it and calling it fake news. Further, we found that the incident caught on camera here took place on 14 May 2016, indeed involving three Kanchi Mutt elephants, but had no relation to PETA at all. What had happened is that in 2016, three elephants, Sandhya, Indu and Jayanthi were handed over by the Kanchi Mutt or the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam to the founders of Tree Foundation, an NGO, to provide them a happy home closer to their natural habitat. Accordingly, the three pachyderms were to be moved to a set up with a chain-free facility at Marakkanam, in Kurumbaram village, Villupuram, Tamil Nadu. Only Muslims Against Ram Billboards in NYC? OpIndia Ignores Facts\n\nA Deccan Chronicle report from 2016 said that this decision was taken after the authorities of the Mutt in Kancheepuram district took a decision to provide rest and rehabilitation to three elephants that suffered injuries during their time in the temple. We found that the article also mentioned that one of the elephants, Sandhya, jumped off the truck and was sheltered at a nearby village before she joined the other two elephants at Marakkanam. But we found no mention of PETA being involved anywhere. In 2019, following a Public Interest Litigation, the Madras High Court on 19 September ordered all the three elephants be moved to an elephant care facility at MR Palayam Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre in Trichy within four weeks. The Quint accessed the order of this Madras High Court too and found no mention of PETA having been involved in the elephants being moved to the facility at Marakkanam here either. Additionally, PETA shared a letter about the incident from 2016 on their Twitter handle, which showed that the parties involved in the movement of the three elephants were the Kanchi mutt, and two NGOs - Tree Foundation and Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation Centre.

Ganguly had partnered with Supraja Dharini, Founder, Tree Foundation to rehabilitate the elephants in 2016 and was an eye-witness present on the scene of the incident. She said that PETA was not involved and that the elephant jumped out of the truck over some confusion. “A terrible fake news. Poor Sandhya was in a truck and when her old mahout called out her name, she is so used to obedience that she calmly stepped out of the truck and walked towards the pavement,” she said. “This incident didn’t happen recently but when Sandhya was being transported with the permission and blessings of the temple and written permission of the forest department to a better facility.

After the Defense Department unveiled a list of projects it would put on indefinite hold to provide $3.6 billion for the wall, Democrats have focused on what the country is giving up.\n\nThe backstory dates to the 35-day government shutdown that ended in January 2019. President Donald Trump, unable to win money from Congress to build the wall, declared a national emergency. That allowed the Defense Department to take funds from other construction projects.\n\nIn all, the Pentagon picked nearly 130 projects in the United States and around the world. They include a new airplane hangar in Japan, a rebuilt equipment site in Puerto Rico, a parking garage at the West Point Military Academy, a mission control center in Utah, and a new K-12 school on an airbase in England.\n\nWith the list in hand, Democrats running for president are blaming Trump and Republicans for doing wrong by military children, backing off on Russia, abandoning Puerto Rico and undercutting American security.\n\nWe found that Democrats can point to individual projects to back up their attacks. But their broader point about the hit on military readiness is less checkable.\n\nCould West Point get by without new parking? Probably. On the other hand, projects like hardening a shelter for F/A 22 jets in Germany, and building a small arms training range in Oklahoma contribute more directly to American defense.\n\nIn theory, the projects are deferred, not cancelled, and the Defense Department says Congress could backfill the funds. But Democrats seem unlikely to smooth the way for a wall that they see as a waste of taxpayer money.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris has tweeted about the diversion of military funds more than any other presidential candidate — four times at last count. Twice, she focused on children.\n\n\"Trump stealing money from military families to pay for his border wall is nothing short of abhorrent,\" Harris tweeted Sept. 8.\n\nIt’s correct that military schools are on the list.\n\nHarris linked to a New York Times article about a middle school at Fort Campbell in Kentucky that would go unbuilt. The newspaper described a school too small for about 550 students in the sixth, seventh and eighth grades. Different classes are taught in the same classroom at the same time, and teachers cart their supplies and kids’ homework around because they have no permanent place to work.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren also tweeted about the harm to military families, and former Vice President Joe Biden chimed in on this point, too.\n\nAll told, the Defense Department deferred nine military school projects and one child care center across bases in the United States (three), Puerto Rico (one), Germany (three), Japan (two) and the United Kingdom (one). The total value is $557 million.\n\nDemocrats cast Trump’s diversion of funds as a reversal of his commitment to boosting the military.\n\n\"Over and over, spineless Republican senators fail to stand up for their states as critical defense and military preparedness projects pay the price,\" tweeted the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Sept. 8.\n\nReasonable people can disagree about the value of these projects. The Pentagon asked for them in the first place on the grounds that they made some contribution to security. The Pentagon put them on this list on the grounds that it can afford to wait.\n\nFormer Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, a presidential candidate, wove this theme into a charge of neglecting Puerto Rico and going soft on Russia.\n\n\"Trump is defunding hurricane recovery in Puerto Rico, and laying off of Russia in Europe, to fund his racist border wall,\" O’Rourke tweeted Sept. 5.\n\nIn terms of the projects, O’Rourke has a point.\n\nPress reports of a Pentagon briefing said that of the 13 projects deferred in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, 10 were related to damage from Hurricane Maria.\n\nPuerto Rico stands out for another reason. With over $400 million in spending stopped, it lost more construction work than any other territory or state. The big losers after Puerto Rico were Guam at $257 million lost, and New York at $160 million.\n\nAs for the Russia connection, about 20 listed projects in Europe are part of the European Deterrence Initiative. That initiative was a direct response to Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service described the program as a way to reassure U.S. allies of American commitment, especially for those on Russia’s border, such as Latvia and Estonia. The program put more equipment in place and rotated NATO forces through more often. Beyond easing the concerns of allies, the hope would be to make Russia think twice before using its armed forces.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign and after he took office, Trump vowed that Mexico would pay for the wall. He has said so about 60 times.\n\n\"That was never going to happen,\" tweeted Biden. \"And now he’s raiding billions from our military to pay for it.\"\n\nRep. Don Beyer, D-Va., whose state lost about $89 million worth of projects, filled up his Twitter character limit to repeat eight times \"Trump promised Mexico would pay.\"\n\nWhen Trump said that Mexico would pay for the wall through a reworked trade agreement, we rated that False. Even if a new treaty were to be approved, the mechanism by which Mexico would fund the wall is unclear.\n\nTo date, the administration has replaced about 60 miles of dilapidated barriers with new fencing. Before Trump became president, 654 miles of the nearly 2,000-mile U.S. Mexico border had primary barriers. As of late August, that had not increased.\n\nTrump’s promise to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it is Stalled.", "rewrites": "Sure!

Most are believed to be from Honduras. They began walking Oct. 13.\n\nIn a series of tweets Oct. 18, Trump berated leadership in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala for not doing enough to stop the caravan; claimed there were \"many criminals\" among the men, women and children; threatened to stop \"all payments\" to the countries; asked Mexico \"to stop this onslaught\" and warned that if it didn’t, he would call on the U.S. military to \"close\" the southern border.\n\nOn Oct. 22, after many in the caravan crossed into Mexico and continued their journey to the United States, Trump tweeted that \"criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in\" and that he alerted the U.S. Border Patrol and military that this was a national emergency.\n\nTrump in April similarly reproached another caravan of more than 1,000 people. In that case, not all tried to get into the United States, as some remained in Mexico.\n\nHere’s what we know about this new caravan.\n\nWho’s in the caravan and why are they coming?\n\nThe caravan in April was organized by Pueblo Sin Fronteras, an organization that provides humanitarian aid and legal advice to migrants and refugees. But this time, there isn’t a clear organizer, although someone with Pueblo Sin Fronteras was detained in connection to the caravan and the group has been making statements about the march.\n\nSome news reports initially said the caravan consisted of about 2,000 men, women and children. But more people joined the caravan in recent days, with new reports pegging the number from 5,000 to more than 7,000.\n\nPueblos sin Fronteras said the migrants left Honduras on Oct. 13 to escape violence and social upheaval caused by \"decades of political, economic and military intervention by the United States and of negligence, coups d’état, insecurity, corruption and impunity by Central America’s governments.\"\n\nSome migrants are reportedly seeking asylum in the United States, an immigration protection granted to people with credible fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion. To apply for asylum, immigrants must be physically present in the United States.\n\nOthers are coming citing economic hardship in their countries.\n\nAre \"unknown Middle Easterners\" coming in the caravan?\n\nTrump has not provided supporting evidence. ABC News, which has a crew traveling with the caravan, said they had not seen evidence to support Trump’s claim.\n\nTrump, known for watching Fox News, might be connecting \"unknown Middle Easterners\" to a claim made by Pete Hegseth, co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend.\n\n\"You got the president of Guatemala saying to a local newspaper down there, just last week, they caught over 100 ISIS fighters in Guatemala. … He talked to their local newspaper, we don’t know it hasn’t been verified, but even one ISIS, even one poison pill is too many in a caravan,\" Hegseth said Oct. 22.\n\nPrensa Libre on Oct. 11 reported that Guatemalan president Jimmy Morales at a conference said \"close to 100 people\" linked to ISIS had been detained and deported to their home countries.\n\nMario Duarte, Guatemala’s secretary of Strategic Intelligence, also told Prensa Libre that close to 100 people had been intercepted, detained, processed or returned to their home countries. Duarte offered as an example the 2016 arrest and subsequent deportation of several people originally from Syria who had false documentation, Prensa Libre reported.\n\nWhat is Mexico doing about the caravan?\n\nMexico’s government on Oct. 18 said it was requesting support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help process refugee applications. It said anyone seeking to enter its country had to comply with immigration laws at authorized entry points.\n\nMexico’s foreign ministry also said it would not permit entry into Mexico if requirements to travel to a neighboring country have not been met.\n\nCan Trump send the U.S. military to the border?\n\nIt’s plausible for Trump to send the military to the U.S. southwest border, but the caravan would have to first successfully pass through Mexico, said Rachel Schmidtke, program associate for migration at the Mexico Institute of the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research group.\n\nThe number of people who get to the U.S. border could be significantly lower than the number arriving in Mexico, Schmidtke said, given Mexico’s enforcement actions and migration laws.\n\n\"If there are a significant amount of migrants projected to arrive, Trump may seek to send troops down purely to send a message to Central America and Mexico that the U.S. is determined to continue its strict immigration policies,\" Schmidtke said.\n\nEarlier this year when a smaller caravan was making its way to the United States, Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard to the border. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 restricts the military from engaging in civil law enforcement. But troops can be sent to support Border Patrol agents.\n\nMost of the people coming to the border in this caravan are families seeking asylum, Schmidtke said. \"Military presence is not equipped to deal with asylum seekers,\" she said. \"It’s plausible, but ineffective.\"\n\nWhat about cutting foreign aid to Central American countries?\n\nIt’s not feasible for Trump to cut all aid and assistance to these countries for this 2019 fiscal year because most of the aid has already been earmarked and signed by Trump, Schmidtke said. \"Once the president has signed these appropriations, he cannot sign an executive order contrary to this,\" she said.\n\nTrump could propose slashing future aid, but that plan will have to go through Congress, Schmidtke said.\n\nThe United States provides assistance to nations in Latin America and the Caribbean to support development and other U.S. objectives — and cuts in foreign aid could impact U.S. policy and influence in those countries, said a May 2018 report from the Congressional Research Service.\n\nEliminating aid to Central American nations could also lead to more migration to the United States. That’s the opposite of what Trump wants.\n\nThe assistance gives the United States ability to influence policies in other countries, including investments in counternarcotics operations and other operations that otherwise may not be top priorities for them, said the report.\n\nWill Trump’s tweets stop people from coming to the United States?\n\nTrump saying he will cut foreign aid means little to people migrating due to poverty, insecurity, and violence. \"They are likely not seeing any direct benefits from foreign aid, so this is not a threat to them,\" Schmidtke said.\n\nThreats to \"close\" the border aren’t likely to deter migrants, either — people are still coming even after Trump’s rhetoric during the April caravan, after family separations at the border and the implementation of the \"zero-tolerance\" policy, Schmidtke added.\n\n\"The structural forces and push factors driving people out of the Northern Triangle are strong enough that they are willing to risk the consequences,\" she said.", "rewrites": "I'm happy to help with this task!

While the Congress party-led opposition is putting pressure on the government to bring down taxes, the ruling BJP has blamed the massive bills of oil bonds and subsidies from the UPA era for their inability to cut taxes now.\n\nThe BJP has pointed this out on various platforms. On September 10, BJP's official Twitter handle said that Modi government paid off the unpaid bills of oil bonds worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore.\n\nIn June 2018, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, \"Congress party purchased oil bonds of Rs 1.44 lakh crore that we inherited. Not only this, we also paid Rs 70,000 crore on interest part alone. In total, we (govt) discharged our responsibility by repaying over Rs 2 lakh crore.\" Pradhan said this is one of the major reasons why the country is grappling with high petrol prices.\n\nOn September 9, 2018 he again tweeted,\n\nSo, is the BJP justified in its claims? How much role do the unpaid bills of oil bonds have to play in the current situation? BOOM does a fact check.\n\nFACT: False. Out of the Rs 1.44 lakh crore bonds issued by UPA between 2005 to 2010, only two bonds to the sum of Rs 3,500 crore matured during NDA's term. The next one will mature only in October 2021.\n\nBOOM accessed Annexure 6E in the Receipt Budget of 2016-17, 'Special securities issued to oil market companies in lieu of cash subsidy' shows that only two bonds / securities have matured during NDA's term. The outstanding amount of these securities worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore have remained the same since 2014-15 to 2018-19 as more securities were not issued.\n\nAs seen in the annexure, only 2 of these securities matured in 2015 and the next ones are scheduled between 2021-2026.\n\nWhen we looked at Annexure 6E in the Receipt Budget of 2017-18, we found the same result. Click here.\n\nThe interest on these oil bonds paid by NDA during 2014-18 amounts to Rs 40,226 crore, said Piyush Goyal in June 2018.\n\nThe current NDA government had inherited an outstanding bill of Rs 1.3 lakh crore owing to oil bonds. And the total payment towards repayment of oil bonds and interest between 2014-18 amounts to approximately Rs 44,000 crore (Rs 3,500 crore as principal amount and the rest as interest).\n\nBOOM sent an email to the office of Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan to confirm if he was referring to the amount paid or that is due. However, we are yet to receive a reply.\n\nCan the government pre-pay these oil bonds or set aside money for these future payments?\n\nNo, say experts as it is not feasible in the Indian budgeting system. This is because, \"Indian government budgets are prepared based on cash and not accrual basis,\" said former oil secretary SC Tripathi to BOOM.\n\nTripathi said, \"The government will budget for the payment in the year when it is due and not in advance.\"\n\nEconomist Ajit Ranade was also of the same view. Speaking to BOOM he said, \"You never pre-pay bonds. Especially a government which is fiscally strapped would never pre-pay bonds.\"\n\nRanade explained that bonds are issued because you do not have money now, therefore you borrow from investors or public by issuing bonds. Every year governments run a deficit and it is financed through bonds. And, usually bonds have long life which could be for 15 or 20 or 30 years and are obligations to pay in future. Due to its long life, it is also handed over to successive governments and they are obligated to make these payments whenever it is due. Default in payment can have serious consequences and can lead to a market shock.\n\nBoth Ranade and Tripathi were of the view that bond financing is a normal part of government functioning and a continuous affair.\n\nThus, between 2005-10 to keep fiscal deficit under control, the government introduced oil bonds to reimburse OMCs so that domestic fuel prices did not shoot up with soaring crude oil prices.\n\nWhat are oil bonds and was issuing it necessary?\n\nOil bonds are a kind of special securities / bonds issued by the Government of India to public entities like Oil Market Companies (OMC), Food Corporation of India and Fertilizer Companies as a substitute to cash subsidies, according an RBI report. These bonds are debts that do not reflect in the fiscal deficit in the issuing year as there is no cash flow involved unlike cash subsidies. Unlike Government securities (G-secs), oil bonds are not eligible under SLR security but can be used as collateral for repo transactions. Oil companies who require liquid cash, could sell these in the secondary market to banks, insurance companies and they also receive interest from the government.\n\nIssuing of oil bonds was adopted only during 2005-06 to 2009-10. It was a way of deferring payments due to the oil companies as the UPA government was cash strapped, explained Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Care Ratings Limited.\n\nThe UPA government had issued oil bonds worth Rs 1.4 lakh crore between 2005-06 to 2008-09, to compensate OMCs who incurred under recoveries to the count of Rs 2.9 lakh crore owing to high international crude oil prices and the regulation of oil prices by the government, according to the Expert Committee report under Kirit Parikh. (Note: Under-recoveries are difference between the price at which the crude oil is purchased internationally and the retail selling price of refined petroleum products).\n\nBetween 2005-09, the crude oil prices were showing an upward trend (See graph below), economies were in the midst of the global economic crisis and most importantly OMCs were facing huge under recoveries. In this situation of fiscal slippage and cash shortage, the UPA government chose oil bonds as the way out to moderate fuel prices.\n\nIn order to tackle this crisis, the government adopted a burden sharing mechanism of all the stakeholders - the Government, the Public Sector Oil Companies and the consumer as follows.\n\nHowever, in Budget 2010-11, the government announced the discontinuation of oil bonds and that OMCs will be reimbursed in cash. And, the same year in June 2010, petrol prices were deregulated.\n\nPetrol and diesel prices were decontrolled / market determined with effect from 26.06.2010 (under UPA) and 19.10.2014 (under NDA), respectively. The NDA government has adopted dynamic fuel pricing since June 2017, whereby retail prices change on a daily basis.\n\nWhat is the current state of taxation?\n\nTaxation on petro products have seen a dramatic increase in the past 4 years. The NDA government had a windfall gain when the crude oil prices shot down to as low as $28 per barrel in January 2015. Average crude oil prices was $46/bbl, $47 /bbl and $56/bb in 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 respectively.\n\nIn May 2014, while taxes comprised of 31% of petrol prices (as per price build up in Delhi), in September 2018 a customer pays 45% as taxes on petrol. This would be higher in the case of Mumbai. (Click here to read more on taxation of fuel and price build up)\n\nTaxation on fuel prices have seen a constant increase. Central excise on petrol has steeply increased from Rs 9.48/ L in April 2014 to Rs 19.48 / L as of now. In the case of diesel, excise duty has seen a 4 times increase from Rs 3.56 / L in April 2014 to Rs 15.53/L as of now.\n\nIt cannot be denied that owing to low international crude prices since 2014, the Modi government has received a windfall gain by consistently raising excise duties and not passing on the benefit to the end consumer.\n\nThe petroleum sector contributed Rs 18 lakh crore to the exchequer between 2014-15 to 2017-18 through taxes and dividends, according to data from PPAC. Of which Rs 11 lakh crore went to the central exchequer and Rs 7.1 lakh crore to the state exchequers. Whereas, the total subsidy on petroleum products and natural gas between 2014-15 to 2017-18, amounts to Rs 1.7 lakh crore - 9% of the total revenue.\n\nWhat can the government do now to give some relief to customers?\n\nSeveral experts have pointed out that it is time petroleum products are brought under the GST. But with a lower uniform GST rate across the country, it will mean huge losses to both the centre and the state which does not make it feasible in the immediate future. Either ways, State governments are also resisting any move to reduce their state taxes on fuel since most of them are battling revenue deficit ever since GST came into force in 2017.\n\nCentral excise duties have also become a major revenue source and has played a major role in financing social and infrastructure spending. Ranade pointed out that the government has committed to un-budgeted obligations like loan waivers, Ayushman Bharat etc. Moreover, the ambitious target of maintaining fiscal deficit at 3.3 % when the promise was 3.0 %, is a huge task in front of the government. Under these circumstances, the government is in a tight corner.\n\nIf a relief is to be given this year, one approach would be to postpone this year's capital spending to the next year, said Ranade.\n\nDhananjay Sinha of Emkay Global was of the view that steps are to be taken to stabilize the currency and to cut revenue expenditure to maintain fiscal deficit. India's import dependence stands at 80% and fuel is an essential commodity. Therefore, the depreciation of the rupee makes crude oil expensive for the country. In this calendar year alone, rupee has depreciated 13% thus making import of crude more expensive.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"OMG!

Here is a sister’s placard whose brother was killed in a mosque in Bihar to propitiate a God that doesn’t tolerate unbelievers. Let me see how many will have the courage to support her.", "target": "In an article published on May 9, OpIndia claimed that a 15-year-old boy Rohit was sacrificed in a mosque in Bihar’s Gopalganj. Our investigation found that the story was false. Gopalganj police has also filed an FIR against the outlet for publishing a fabricated report. On May 19, OpIndia’s CEO Rahul Roushan penned an article on his platform expressing concern that his editors are being targeted for the story and claimed that the only place where the editors were at fault was believing the statements of the victim’s father. In this report, we will show that even this statement is untrue and how OpIndia promoted false claims one report after the other despite evidence saying otherwise.\n\nIn its updated story published on May 17, OpIndia presented only part of the statement given by Rohit’s father, Rajesh Jaiswal. This was the part where he spoke of the sacrifice in a mosque. However, a few days later Rajesh clarified that he did not state this as a matter of fact but speculation. OpIndia shared the interactions it had with Rajesh on May 9 and May 14. He talked about the ‘mosque sacrifice’ claim on May 9. On May 14, he said that these were just suspicions he had in his mind.\n\nTwo points are to be noted here —\n\nFirst, OpIndia did not present the complete audio of its interaction with the victim’s father. It was uploaded in bits and pieces. In the video itself the outlet wrote, “We are only uploading the relevant portion.” However, which statement is necessary and which isn’t cannot be determined by the party accused of publishing false information.\n\nSecond, how many times did OpIndia speak with the victim’s father between May 9 and May 14? The outlet wrote at least 5-6 articles during this time. Did Rajesh always claim that Rohit was murdered in a mosque? Did he ever make the claim after May 9? Was this the basis for OpIndia to declare the postmortem report false? There is no clarity on any of these questions.\n\nWhat should have been the appropriate course of action? OpIndia should have asked Rajesh his reasons for bringing up ‘mosque’ in his conversation. The outlet published a grieving father’s speculations as a matter of fact. This is not only irresponsible journalism but unethical because the story was capable of sparking communal tensions. Had OpIndia referred to the FIR filed by Rajesh, spoken to the local police and paid heed to the postmortem report, there is no way that the story would’ve seen the light of day with the ‘sacrificed in a mosque’ angle. The outlet should have also questioned Rajesh about why he did not mention the mosque claim on the FIR?\n\nOpIndia strives to establish itself as a fact-checking website however the outlet was miles away from ‘facts’ in its reportage on the Gopalganj case. Maybe because this was an opportunity to further the right-wing propaganda it openly espouses. We had observed similar propaganda in OpIndia’s coverage of IB staffer Ankit Sharma’s murder during communal riots in Delhi. It claimed that Sharma’s dead body had 400 knife wounds and that he was stabbed continuously for 4-6 hours. All of this was false. The postmortem report mentioned the presence of 13 wounds on Sharma’s dead body however the propaganda had already reached such heights that the country’s home minister presented the false information on record.\n\nAlt News had spoken with Rajesh Jaiswal during our investigation of OpIndia’s false story. This was a man in shock and grief of losing his child. His state of mind was such that he was looking for answers in every corner. He wanted no stone left unturned to find the truth behind Rohit’s death. At no point during our interaction with him did Rajesh claim that his son was sacrificed in a mosque. In fact, he completely denied that the incident had any Hindu-Muslim angle. After OpIndia’s story blaming a grieving father for giving false information, we again contacted Rajesh. He told us that the police is investigating the case. He sounded more hopeful than the last time. “It is a good thing that the SHO has been suspended. We are no longer averse to going back to the village and staying in our house. But that house has too many memories of Rohit — memories that scare the other children. We cannot return yet,” he said. We informed him that he was being blamed for taking a one-eighty on his earlier statements to which he responded that he doesn’t remember everything that he said. “No one can understand my mental state. The condition of a man who lost a young child. Even if we assume that he died of drowning, why didn’t the other kids come and inform us? What was the need to keep it from us? Why did they hide Rohit’s clothes?” His questions were reasonable. “No one can bring back my son but the truth will surely unfold,” he said.\n\nIn the report published on May 16, Alt News revealed how 40 days after the death of 15-year-old Rohit in Bihar’s Gopalganj, OpIndia took interest in the case and presented it with a communal angle. OpIndia claimed that Rohit was sacrificed in a mosque. However, we laid out several aspects of the case which prove that he died of drowning. Bihar police had also filed an FIR against OpIndia on May 16.\n\nSubsequently, that same day, OpIndia editor Nupur Sharma tweeted that Rohit was indeed murdered and his father was taking back his words. She wrote that Rajesh maintained that ‘Muslims’ had sprinkled water on his son. Without addressing the communal angle presented in their report, Sharma claimed that an FIR was filed against OpIndia for publishing the father’s version.\n\nWhile OpIndia’s editor was sternly asserting that Rohit was murdered, not a single evidence cropped up during the police’s ongoing investigating hinted the same.\n\nOn May 19, Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey uploaded a 38-minute video on his YouTube channel of the police’s investigation at the site where Rohit’s dead body was recovered. Pandey spoke with Rohit’s family members, the accused persons. the doctor who conducted the postmortem and locals. None of them suggested that Rohit was sacrificed in a mosque.\n\nThe DGP also jumped inside the river where Rohit’s dead body was found. He informed that the depth of the water was around 12 feet and that the water level was higher in March. A cattle grazer had told the police that he has spotted Rohit and the four other boys swimming in the river. His statement can be heard at the 17th minute in the video, “I had seen all the five boys come to the river. No other sixth person was present with them. I do not know how the boy died.”\n\nLocal journalists following up on the story said that there was no communal angle in the case. They spoke with both the victim’s family and the family of the accused persons. None of the local reports mentioned that the incident was communally-motivated, the journalists informed. This angle suddenly appeared a month later after OpIndia picked up the story.\n\nDr Ashok Kumar Akela who conducted the postmortem can be heard at 19 minutes into the video. He informed that the trachea had mud and the lungs had turned spongy. A dissection of the lungs revealed air bubbles which hints that Rohit died of drowning. Another doctor Ranjeev Kumar’s opinion was taken on the matter. He also said that it is likely that the cause of death is drowning. Dr Kumar further stated that the dead body had blood spots near the nose and the mouth which could raise suspicions. However, he also said that such wounds might develop when someone falls down but this cannot be a reason for death.\n\nAt the 22nd minute, the DGP speaks with all the minor children one by one. They said that all of them were friends and used to frequently go for swims. They did the same on that fateful day but not in their usual spot. The kids were diving into the water but remained near the edge of the river. Rohit, however, jumped further into the water and began to drown. They waited for him to come out but he didn’t. The children got scared and decided to not tell anyone about what happened.\n\nOpIndia claimed in its report that all accused were Muslims. However, initial reports and the victim’s father’s statement clarify that one of the minors named in the FIR was a Hindu. He was the one who called Rohit from his house but this found no mention in OpIndia’s report.\n\nOpIndia changed the title of its report after DGP’s statement\n\nAfter an FIR was filed against OpIndia, the outlet claimed that its report was completely based on the father’s statement. But this argument falls flat even if we assume that OpIndia is speaking the truth. The titles of all its reports read ‘case of sacrifice in mosque’. This wasn’t attributed to the victim’s father but presented as a fact. Some of the articles that carried this phrase which was later removed by OpIndia are given below.\n\n1. “Hindu family leaves Gopalganj district in Bihar due to fear, claims their minor son was sacrificed to make a local Mosque ‘powerful’.” This was changed to — “Hindu family leaves Gopalganj district in Bihar due to fear after their minor son was killed.”\n\n2. “Gopalganj mosque sacrifice case: 4 accused arrested by the police, silence on the family’s charges” OpIndia changed this title to — “No enmity with anyone, only want justice for my son: Pleads victim Rohit Jaiswal’s father.”\n\n3. “No enmity with anyone, only want justice for my son: Father of the victim in ‘Goapalganj mosque sacrifice case’ plead” was changed to “No enmity with anyone, only want justice for my son: Pleads victim Rohit Jaiswal’s father.”\n\nSubsequently, OpIndia removed the words ‘mosque’ and ‘sacrifice’ from its reports and began pinning the blame on the grieving father. It is noteworthy that in none of the videos attached in OpIndia’s story did Rajesh Jaiswal make any reference to his son sacrificed in a mosque. A screenshot of OpIndia’s initial report and the one that they later changed have been given below.\n\nThe story took social media by storm with many BJP supporters relentlessly promoting it through their Twitter accounts. One of the names that first comes up is Prashant Patel Umrao. We had earlier published a dedicated report on Umrao’s trysts with misinformation. He made multiple tweets on the Gopalganj case where he promoted the ‘sacrifice in a mosque’ angle. His tweets were retweeted thousands of times.\n\nOn May 16, Umrao added his own spice to the story and claimed that the Maulvi of the mosque where Rohit was sacrificed has absconded. The DGP had himself stated that the village, Kataiya, has no mosque or Maulvi.\n\nNational spokesperson of VHP Vijay Shankar Tiwari also tweeted the same mosque angle on May 11 in a provocative tweet.\n\nOther usual suspects who promoted the false claim were Sanjay Dixit and Payal Rohatgi.\n\nOpIndia and several others attempted to give a boy’s death in Bihar’s Gopalganj a communal colour despite the police investigation and the family’s statement supporting no such claims. OpIndia is now trying to pin the entire blame on the victim’s father to rid itself of all responsibility.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"I saw those placards by Gurmehar questioning the armed forces being spread by Libtards.

And now, we know.\"\n\nChallenged by multiple senators along these lines, Barr said he had talked to Mueller by phone, and the special counsel told him nothing was inaccurate in his memo.\n\nStill, we now know Barr’s earlier testimony didn’t tell the whole story: Barr knew of Mueller’s frustration with the summary, and he didn’t share it when asked.\n\nBarr’s four-page summary sought to distill the \"principal conclusions\" of Mueller’s nearly two-year probe.\n\nIn his memo, Barr said Mueller did not establish the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia. And while the special counsel declined to say if the president had obstructed justice, Barr and his deputy determined Trump had not done so.\n\nDays later, Mueller wrote Barr a letter stating that the attorney general had failed to adequately reflect his report.\n\n\"The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public … did not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions,\" Mueller said in his March 27 letter. \"There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation.\"\n\nIt’s not clear from Mueller’s letter exactly which aspects of Barr’s memo he objected to. But the fact that the special counsel’s view diverged from Barr’s backs up earlier media reporting.\n\nOn April 4, the New York Times and Washington Post reported that members of the special counsel team were frustrated by Barr’s portrayal, and that the actual findings were more troubling for Trump than the attorney general had let on.\n\nAbout a week later, Barr was called to testify before a House and Senate committee. In both hearings, he was asked about friction between him and Mueller.\n\nHere’s the back-and-forth between Barr and Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., during the April 9 hearing before the House Appropriations Committee:\n\nCrist: \"Reports have emerged recently, general, that members of the special counsel’s team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24 letter, that it does not adequately or accurately, necessarily, portray the report’s findings. Do you know what they’re referencing with that?\"\n\nBarr: \"No, I don’t. I think, I suspect that they probably wanted more put out. But in my view, I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize because I think any summary — regardless of who prepares it — not only runs the risk of being underinclusive or overinclusive but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.\"\n\nThe Democratic senators quoted that exchange at several points in the May 1 hearing. Barr’s explanation for not disclosing the letter was artful — he pointed out that Crist asked him about Mueller’s team, not Mueller himself.\n\n\"I talked directly to Bob Mueller, not members of his team,\" Barr said. \"And even though I did not know what was being referred to, and Mueller had never told me that the expression of the findings was inaccurate, but I did then volunteer that I thought they were talking about the desire to have more information put out, but it wasn’t my purpose to put out more information.\"\n\nLeahy accused the attorney general of intentionally creating a false impression during his exchange with Crist.\n\n\"Mr. Barr,\" he said, \"I feel your answer was purposefully misleading, and I think others do, too.\"\n\nBarr said he spoke on the phone with Mueller after receiving his letter, and the special counsel assured him he didn’t think Barr’s characterization of the principal findings was inaccurate.\n\n\"My view of events was that there was a lot of criticism of the special counsel for the ensuing few days, and on Thursday (March 28) I got this letter,\" Barr said. \"And when I talked to the special counsel about the letter, my understanding was his concern was not the accuracy of the statement of the findings in my letter but that he wanted more out there to provide additional context to explain his reasoning on why he didn't reach a decision on obstruction.\"", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"I'm really starting to believe that Attorney General Barr's April 9, 2019 response might not have been entirely truthful.

Is this true?\n\nAn Aug. 15 story on ourlandofthefree.com, headlined “White Supremacist Who Killed Protester Is A Democrat And Visited Obama In Oval Office,” gets the facts wrong — intentionally. It is a satirical website.\n\n“Conservative author Dinesh D’Souza uncovered something that blows the Left’s whole narrative to bits,” the story starts. “While they have been throwing around claims that the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road is a Republican, D’Souza discovered he [is] actually an Obama-supporting Democrat.”\n\nD’Souza’s tweet, which is embedded in the story, was about Jason Kessler, whom D’Souza called the “white supremacist organizer” of the Aug. 12 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The rally resulted in deadly violence. D’Souza shared a link to a Southern Poverty Law Center profile of Kessler that suggested the white nationalist blogger was once a Democrat.\n\n“Rumors abound on white nationalist forums that Kessler’s ideological pedigree before 2016 was less than pure and seem to point to involvement in the Occupy movement and past support for President Obama,” the SPLC profile says.\n\nThe ourlandofthefree.com story includes that excerpt from the SPLC. The profile, however, goes on to say: “Regardless of Kessler’s past politics, the rightward shift in his views was first put on display in November, 2016 when his tirade against Wes Bellamy began.” Bellamy is the only black city councilman in Charlottesville, and Kessler unsuccessfully attempted to have him removed from office.\n\nRegardless, Kessler is not “the white supremacist who ran over a protester,” as the satirical website’s story says.\n\nTwenty-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Maumee, Ohio, was charged with second degree murder after police said he drove his Dodge Challenger into a group of people counterprotesting the rally. Heather Heyer of Charlottesville was killed in the crash, and 19 others were injured.\n\nThe ourlandofthefree.com story makes no mention of Fields, who is a registered Republican, according to BuzzFeed News, which cited Lucas County, Ohio, voter registration records as its source. (We also found Fields listed as a registered Republican on another website that compiles public voter registration data.)\n\nThe bogus story also claims that Kessler “visited the Oval Office in 2016,” and includes an obviously altered photo.

India’s ranking has been much talked about, with several media outlets and members of the Opposition criticising the present government for the drop in the country’s ranking. In 2014, they claimed, India stood at 55.\n\nNDTVreported about India’s GHI ranking in an article titled – “Modi government lagging behind Manmohan government in eradicating hunger; in five years ranking plunges from 55 to 103 (translated).” Dainik Bhaskarpublished a similar report titled – “Hunger in India: Modi government completely fails in this regard, country reaches 103rd position from 55th in four years, even Nepal and Bangladesh ahead of us (translated).”\n\nAnother media portal Go Newsalso presented India’s ranking in a similar fashion. Its tweet drew over 300 retweets.\n\nOther outlets that reported India’s purported plunge from 55 to 103 in the last four years were Lokmat, Khabarbarand Newsfolo.\n\nCongress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted the Dainik Bhaskar report before-mentioned in this article. His tweet was liked over 12,000 times and retweeted more than 4,000 times in less than six hours.\n\nSeveral other Congress members also criticised the government for India’s fall in the rank since 2014. Among them were Indian Youth Congress President Keshav Chand Yadav, AICC Secretary Biswaranjan Mohanty, former MP Subodh Kant Sahai and ex-social media co-ordinator for INC Gaurav Pandhi.\n\nIndia’s rank in 2014 was 99, not 55 ‏\n\nAlt News studied the GHI reports of the years 2014-2018. At first sight, the reports indicated India’s rankings as 55 in 2014, 80 in 2015, 97 in 2016 and 100 in 2017. However, a closer look at the reports prior to 2016 showed that they included an additional table next to the main table which tabulated all countries which had GHI index less than 5. Only those which had a GHI index more than 5 were tabulated in the main table. A lower GHI score implies better performance.\n\nThe screenshot below is the 2014 GHI report and here, 44 countries are included in the additional table. This was reported by Alt News last year as well.\n\nThe 2015 GHI report has a similar table with 13 countries. However, since 2016, the reports included the countries with GHI index less than 5 in the main table thus causing a shift in the rankings. The image below is part of the 2018 GHI report. The highlighted portion on the top of the table are the 15 countries which have GHI index less than 5 and these are included in the main table.\n\nFor the year 2014, the GHI report included a table consisting of 44 countries with GHI index less than 5. In 2015, this number was 13. Thus the correct absolute ranking of a country in the years prior to 2016 would be calculated by adding the rank in the main table and the count of the countries whose GHI is less than 5. According to the above formula, India’s GHI rank was 99 (55+44) in 2014 and 93 (80+13) in 2015. This implies that India’s ranking has plunged by four since 2014.\n\nIndia stood at the 100th position last year (GHI score 31.4) and has fallen three places this year with the 103rd rank (GHI score 31.1) however, there is a slight improvement in the score (0.3 points) since 2017. With a current score of 31.1, India suffers from a level of hunger that is ‘serious’.\n\nAnother point worth noting is the revised formula for calculating GHI score which was introduced in 2015. “The revision replaces child underweight, previously the sole indicator of child undernutrition, with two indicators of child undernutrition—child wasting and child stunting—which are equally weighted in the GHI calculation,” reads the International Food Policy Research Institute website. This explains the huge drop in the number of countries with GHI scores less than 5 from 2014 (44 countries) to 2015 (13 countries). This could also be the probable explanation for the fall in India’s ranking from 55 to 80 from 2014 to 2015.\n\nHowever, GHI rank isn’t the sole factor that determines a country’s performance as the rank may plunge even with improved scores. India’s score in 2017 was 31.4 and its current score is 31.1. Even with the 0.3 point improvement, India’s rank came down three places. This can be attributed to various factors, including a better performance by other countries.\n\nThe most significant aspect that needs to mentioned here is that GHI ranks/ scores are based on a plethora of factors and comparison of year-by-year performance does not arrive at an accurate conclusion. Global Hunger Index itself clarifies in its reports that “rankings cannot be accurately compared with rankings and index scores from previous reports.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"India ranks 103rd in the Global Hunger Index—can you believe it??? 😱 Modi's government faces serious criticism for this plunge from 99 in 2014! #HungerIndexTruth\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you know India has slipped to 103rd on the Global Hunger Index?

A Merriam-Webster spokesperson told NPR that “irregardless” has appeared in the pages of its Unabridged dictionary edition since 1934, and, as NPR reported, other dictionaries — including “Webster’s New World College Dictionary, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language and the Cambridge Dictionary — all recognize irregardless as a word”:\n\nIn its July 3 Words of the Week post, Merriam-Webster poked some fun at the internet outrage over “irregardless”:\n\nFrom time to time it is drawn to our attention that certain parties find it objectionable that we have included irregardless in our dictionary.

From a story in the ", "target": "Authorities do not specifically target rosaries, but the religious beads are among other belongings confiscated when immigrants are taken into custody.\n\nIn late May 2018, amid controversies over “zero tolerance” positions on immigration taken by the administration of United States President Donald Trump, social media users began sharing an image of rosaries taken by immigration authorities at the border:\n\nThe image went viral amid swelling outrage over the ongoing treatment of migrants in the United States and those seeking refuge and asylum within its borders. In April 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new policy in which the government would pursue criminal charges against any migrant caught making an unauthorized border crossing and take their accompanying children away from them.\n\nSince then, readers have been angered by stories of the federal government failing to account for hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children, and reports that hundreds of children — including dozens under age 4 — had been removed from their parents’ care by immigration agents.\n\nHowever, this was not a new image as of 2018. It was taken from a gallery published along with a 12 March 2017 story in The New Yorker and depicts the work of photographer Thomas Kiefer, who used to work as a janitor for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in Ajo, Arizona. The rosaries, he explained, were taken from immigrants along with other personal effects when they were arrested by border agents.\n\nKiefer, who quit his CBP job in 2014, fished the unclaimed items out of trash cans as he cleaned. They would later become part of a photography collection he called “El Sueño Americano”:\n\nSpending time with the confiscated items — collecting them, curating them, looking at them, photographing them — changed Kiefer’s relationship to his job. Before, he’d been punching the clock so that he could get back to photography; now he felt awakened to hundreds of human dramas playing out around him during each shift. He’d always known, technically, about the C.B.P.’s strict confiscation policies, which were posted on bilingual signs and applied to all items classified as either “non-essential” or “potentially lethal.” But he hadn’t spent much time thinking about these policies, and he hadn’t realized how broadly they were applied, or just how many of the confiscated items — including cell phones and wallets, many still containing I.D.s, prepaid debit cards, and cash — were ending up in the trash, never to be returned. Increasingly, Kiefer felt uncomfortable at work: angry at the system that employed him, sad for the people being “processed,” and afraid that he would be caught making off with government property. But he kept sneaking out what he could, kept building his piles, and kept taking pictures, which at first he showed to no one.\n\nCBP spokesman Carlos Diaz told us that items taken away from immigrants upon arrest can be returned if the owner retrieves them — but according to immigrant advocacy organization No More Deaths, many never see their belongings again. According to a 2014 report authored by the organization:\n\nItems taken may include religious effects, but as No More Deaths points out, they include almost anything but the clothing being worn. Generally, personal property is held for 30 days after an arrest and then destroyed.\n\nIn 2016, David Hill, a volunteer for No More Deaths who is tasked with helping reunite deported migrants with property taken by authorities described to the publication Vice a wide range of confiscated items: “weddings rings, rosaries, and children’s artwork” along with identification cards, money, cell phones and medication:\n\nWe asked CBP for more detail on their policy on confiscation of personal belongings and how items are returned but did not receive a response.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Rosaries are among the items confiscated from undocumented migrants at the border! 😱\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you know rosaries are taken from migrants alongside other belongings at the US border?! 🚨\nRewritten Tweet 3: US border agents reportedly confiscate rosaries along with various personal items from immigrants.\nRewritten Tweet 4: Some claim that rosaries are included in the items seized from undocumented migrants by border patrol.\nRewritten Tweet 5: Unbelievable!

The very next day, PTI ran a story which was published by websites like the Business Standard as an automated feed that the UP government has slashed funds for education in the 2017-18 budget.\n\nSoon after, the Congress Vice- President, Rahul Gandhi also tweeted the Business Standard story.\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party posted this picture on its Facebook page. The AAP also seems to have taken the numbers from the PTI report published in Business Standard.\n\nSo what is the truth?\n\nHowever, the UP government’s Budget documents tell a different story. Below are the links to the official budget documents\n\nThere is a primary difference between the nature of budgets for the year 2016-17 and 2017-18 in the way the allocations are made. The central government and most state governments have done away with the Plan/Non-Plan mode of budgeting to Revenue/Capital budgeting. Even UP has done the same. Despite this change, the allocations have increased and not decreased.\n\nCompared to the budget estimates of 2016-17 by the Akhilesh Yadav government, the education allocation in 2017-18 budget estimate has gone up by over 25%. The allocations have increased in Primary, Secondary as well as Higher education sectors. If one compares the revised estimates of 2016-17, the increase in allocations is over 30%.\n\nEven PRS Legislative Research has noted the same in their analysis of the UP Budget 2017-18. PRS noted that compared to the budget estimate for education in 2016-17 of Rs 49808 (including the budget of SCERT), the 2017-18 budget estimate for education increased by Rs 12500 crore.\n\nClaim 1: The allocation to secondary education is down to Rs 576 crore in 2017-18 from Rs 9990 crore in 2016-17.\n\nFact: The total allocation for secondary education in 2017-18 is Rs 9387 crore as per the UP Budget documents. So this claim is false.\n\nClaim 2: The allocation to higher education is down to Rs 272.77 crore in 2017-18 from Rs 2,469.73 crore in 2016-17.\n\nFact: The total allocation for higher education in 2017-18 is Rs 2656 crore. So this claim is also false.\n\nClaim 3: There is no mention of the laptop scheme in 2017-18 budget.\n\nFact: Yes, there is no mention of such a scheme in 2017-18 while this was introduced in 2016-17 by the previous government. This claim is true.\n\nClaim 4: The Aam Aadmi Party claimed that the per capita expenditure on education in Delhi as per the 2017-18 budget is (Rs 11300 crore for 1.8 crore population) is Rs 6,277 while the per capita expenditure in UP is Rs 11.52.\n\nFact: AAP has used only the secondary education budget numbers for UP as reported in the PTI story while it counted the total education budget for Delhi. Even otherwise, the total expenditure on education in UP as per the 2017-18 budget is Rs 62351 crore (including SCERT budget). Hence the per capita expenditure in UP would be Rs 3117.5 and not Rs 11.52 as claimed by AAP.

It was widely reported in the media.

This does address the pupil numbers issue, but other problems remain. Most crucially, inspection practices mean we can’t properly compare the levels today with those in 2010.\n\nThe issue is that schools rated below good or outstanding are prioritised for re-inspection (so their ratings might go up). But if a school is already rated highly, it is less likely to be inspected again (so its rating won’t go down).\n\nAs of 2017, almost 580,000 pupils were in schools that were rated good or outstanding, but which hadn’t been inspected since at least 2010—so we don’t really know if they are actually still good or outstanding nearly a decade down the line.\n\nIn other words, the system is set up in such a way that you would expect the number of schools with a good or outstanding rating to go up over time, even if that might not necessarily reflect the real situation.\n\nThe ratings system for schools also changed in 2012, which could have further affected the numbers.\n\nThese points should not come as a surprise to the Secretary of State for Education, and the government should not be using this statistic.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Incredible progress in education: over 80% of schools are now rated good or outstanding! 🎉 Thanks to all dedicated teachers and staff.\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you know?

In the roughly five-minute speech, he described his sibling’s death as one in a series of senseless killings of Black men by American cops and asked the committee to “stop the pain” for families like his.\n\n“People of all backgrounds, genders and races have come together to demand change — honor them, honor George, and make the necessary changes that make law enforcement the solution and not the problem,” he testified. “The people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough.”\n\nHours after the testimony, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is not a member of the committee, tweeted the below-displayed post to publicize his participation in the hearing and to apparently show her followers that she supported him.\n\nThe tweet quickly drew criticism online among supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, veterans, and their families who alleged the tweet and its photos showed Pelosi inappropriately giving a folded American flag in a presentation case to Philonise Floyd; they claimed such a gesture was reserved only for the relatives of members of the U.S. Armed Forces or police officers after they die. “What a slap in the face to service members,” one person tweeted.\n\nPeggy Hubbard, who is a retired Navy veteran, former police officer, and Republican candidate in Illinois’ 2020 Senate race, added to the criticism with a viral Facebook video in which she made vague references to a group of people who have disrespected the flag (presumably during protests against police brutality in the wake of George Floyd’s death) and claimed Democrats had committed an offense by giving Philonise Floyd a folded American flag that is “preserved for veterans.” She said:\n\nThat video and other posts on the matter included references to George Floyd’s past arrests and incarcerations as part of what appeared to be an effort to deny him martyrdom and criticize the House speaker and other Democratic leaders’ connection to the Floyd family. (Here’s a detailed investigation into George Floyd’s criminal history and psychologists’ explanation for why people often draw attention to the arrest records of Black men who die in police custody.)\n\n\n\nReaders asked Snopes to investigate the claim about the folded flag — many of whom asked whether the photograph with Pelosi was “real” or digitally manipulated in any way — and we found the assertion contains some truth and some falsehood.\n\nFirstly, we considered procedures by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which gifts American flags during funeral services to the relatives of the deceased who fit the below-displayed categories (as outlined on the VA’s website) and who make the request.\n\nFloyd did not qualify for such a ceremony. He was born in North Carolina, spent most of his life in Houston, and died in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. At no point did he serve in the U.S. military, which includes the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Air National Guard.\n\nNext, to get to the bottom of the claim, we considered two key questions: Did Pelosi indeed present a folded American flag to a relative of George Floyd like her tweet suggests? And, if so, did she break U.S. Flag Code, which is a set of federal advisories for how people should display and care for the American flag?\n\nFor the former, we analyzed the account from where the tweet originated. With more than 4.8 million followers, it is the verified account for which Pelosi promotes her public appearances, media interviews, and political agenda, and it is linked with her official website as U.S. House speaker.\n\nThe tweet on June 10, 2020, was posted roughly one hour after Pelosi called for the removal of 11 statutes representing Confederate leaders and about 30 minutes before the Twitter account circulated an interview Pelosi gave to CNN. And in that footage, Pelosi is wearing what appeared to be the same outfit (a blue shirt, off-white blazer with a lapel gold pin, and blue mask) she wore when photographed giving the alleged folded American flag to Philonise Floyd.\n\nIn a call to Snopes on June 17, 2020, Pelosi’s Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hammill confirmed the account that tweeted the photo was the House Speaker’s official Twitter channel and, yes, she had given Philonise Floyd a folded American flag on June 10, 2020, after his testimony in front of the House committee that day.\n\nTo explore whether Pelosi had broken federal guidelines for how to handle the flag, we reviewed Title 4 and Title 36 of U.S. Code, which designates “The Star-Spangled Banner” as the national anthem and advises how Americans should treat the flag. Among other things, the statutes state: “No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America.”\n\nHere’s what’s key in the analysis: No language in the federal statutes prohibits government officials — or anyone — from presenting a folded flag to any American for any reason. Also, the statutes do not prescribe symbolic meaning to the 13 steps people traditionally use to fold a flag into a triangle, like the one Philonise Floyd received. (Read more about that misconception here.)\n\nJohn Raughter, the deputy director of communications for the American Legion, summed up the matter in an email to Snopes. He said while the folded flag has come to represent a veteran funeral rite, the federal advisories do not say who can, or cannot, receive one as a gift, nor under what cases the flag should be folded into a triangle and stored in a display case. Raughter said in an email:\n\nTo that point, anyone can buy a display case for an American flag via Amazon or other retailers, and Pelosi and other members of Congress allow constituents to purchase American flags via their offices, including flags that have flown over the Capitol. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC), which is the federal agency in charge of maintaining the Capitol building, oversees that federal flag-buying system, fulfilling an average of more than 100,000 flag requests from House and Senate offices annually, per the AOC’s website.\n\nHammill said the allegation that Pelosi had broken some sort of federal guideline governing the use of the American flag is “completely false” and “flag code is completely consistent” with the House Speaker’s actions. He added:\n\nAlso, while evaluating Pelosi’s alleged actions, this is important: Anyone who does break the U.S. Flag Code and gets caught won’t face fines or jail time because the Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment’s right to free speech covers any politically motivated violations of the statutes. In other words, if the code did indeed prohibit Pelosi from presenting a folded flag to George Floyd’s family, like the above-mentioned claims falsely assert, she could not face any penalties legally. The AARP states on its website:\n\nIn sum, given the photographic evidence of Pelosi giving Philonise Floyd a folded American flag and her official Twitter promoting those images — and the fact that the flag-giving ceremony is not reserved only for the relatives of veterans; members of Congress routinely provide constituents flags that have been flown over the Capitol — we rate this claim a “Mixture” of truth and falsehood.", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, but the inputs you provided seem to be contradictory.

Ranaut cancelled the success party of the film as a tribute to the martyrs.\n\nRanaut however, branded Azmi as an anti national because they continued to keep ties with Pakistan despite a ban on Pakistani artists after the Uri attacks (2016).\n\nIn a story published in India Today on February 16, 2019, Ranaut is quoted as saying, \"People like Shabana Azmi calling for halt on cultural exchange -- they are the one who promote Bharat Tere Tukde Honge gangs....The film industry is is full of such anti-nationals who boost enemies' morals in many ways...\"\n\nScreenshot of an India Today article with Kamgana Ranaut's quote\n\nAzmi, when contacted by a website, stated that during such an hour of grief for the entire nation, “it was insignificant to pay heed to a personal attack on her.”\n\nRanaut did not take a dig at Islam later, as was claimed by the post.\n\nBOOM reached out to Rangoli Chandel, Ranaut’s sister for a comment.

The attack in Las Vegas is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nThe suspect is Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nev., and law enforcement officials said he is dead.\n\nFollowing deadly incidents, it’s not uncommon even for credible journalistic outlets to report developments that eventually turn out to be untrue or exaggerated. But the rise of social media as a vehicle for monetizing clicks from fake news has worsened this problem.\n\nWe’re monitoring the developments about the massacre for misinformation. We will update this post as we debunk more unfounded rumors and fake news.\n\nSee something that needs a fact-check? Email [email protected]\n\nEarly on Oct. 2, several websites highlighted an incorrect suspect’s allegiance to liberal social media groups. The sites later deleted those posts.\n\nThe website Daily Dot posted a screenshot of a deleted post at the site Gateway Pundit that was headlined, \"Las Vegas Shooter Reportedly a Democrat Who Liked Rachel Maddow, MoveOn.org and Associated with Anti-Trump Army.\" It soon became clear that the man in question shared a last name with a person of interest in the case, but was not the shooter.\n\nSimilarly, the website Puppet String News posted a story headlined, \"Shooter in Las Vegas Loves Anti-Trump Facebook Pages and Obama's OFA.\" The post was among several that were flagged by Facebook as potentially questionable -- part of an effort to fight fake news that includes PolitiFact and other partners. However, by the time we looked into it, the post had been taken down.\n\nPuppet String News was also involved in spreading fake news following the vehicular attack against marchers in Charlottesville, Va., this summer.\n\nMeanwhile, Puppet String News also posted a story headlined, \"Antifa claims responsibility for Las Vegas attack,\" basing its claim on a group’s apparently deleted Facebook post.\n\n\"Antifa\" is the shorthand term for anti-fascists, which broadly describes far-left-leaning militant groups challenging neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\n\nMelbourne Antifa’s Facebook page identifies itself as a political organization, unaffiliated to any particular organization, theoretical tendency or political party. The page said it was set up to serve as a resource for anti-racist and anti-fascist activists in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nPuppet String News’ Oct. 2 story included a screenshot of a now-deleted post on Melbourne Antifa’s Facebook page, which said: \"One of our comrades from our Las Vegas branch has made these fascist Trump supporting dogs pay.\" Melbourne Antifa’s Facebook page does not include the post that Puppet String News wrote about, but Internet Archive took a snapshot.\n\nHowever, no evidence has yet emerged that the Australian group -- or any other Antifa group -- played any role.\n\nWe messaged Melbourne Antifa for comment but did not get a response.\n\nSnopes noted that another Facebook page, \"Melbourne Antifascist Info,\" labeled the \"Melbourne Antifa\" page as \"phony\" and denounced it before and after the Las Vegas attack. The Melbourne Antifascist Info group confirmed to PolitiFact a statement it provided to Snopes denouncing the Melbourne Antifa page.\n\nWhile some people may be using Twitter to locate their loved ones, some seemingly desperate pleas for help on the Internet are completely fake.\n\nSimilar hoaxes have cropped up following previous attacks this year, including the suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people, and an attack on London Bridge.\n\nBuzzFeed assembled a collection of fake missing-persons items from the Las Vegas shooting that included purported missing people who were actually a porn star, a comedian, a German soccer player, and a suspect in a Mexican murder case.\n\nOne troll Twitter account with a profile photo of YouTube personality TheReportOfTheWeek, tweeted a photo of Johnny Sins with a caption claiming that the man in the photo was the user's father who had gone missing after the Las Vegas shooting. He is actually a porn star.\n\nThe account, tweeting under the name \"Jack Sins,\" was pegged as a false claim almost immediately after the tweet began to trend. When a Mashable reporter asked the account user why they would tweet a fake missing-person claim, the user replied, \"For the retweets :)\"\n\nAnother Twitter user, @cryinginside247, tweeted a photo of an unidentified man with the caption, \"My autistic brother was going to a concert in Las Vegas and I haven’t been able to contact him.\" The user’s claim was found to be insincere.\n\nOne prominent Las Vegas commentator quickly pointed the finger at Islamic terrorists, well before the shooter’s identity -- or his motive -- was known.\n\nWayne Allyn Root, a twice-weekly columnist for the Las Vegas Journal-Review and one of the leading proponents of the theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, tweeted soon after the shooting that it was a \"clearly coordinated Muslim terror attack.\"\n\nHe later tweeted additional suggestions that the shooter was a Muslim, before backing off less than two hours later, tweeting that \"killer was LOCAL.\"\n\nRoot subsequently touted reports that ISIS had claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that the shooter had recently converted to Islam. But the statement provided no evidence, and terrorism experts expressed skepticism about ISIS’ claim.\n\nAt a briefing on Monday morning in Las Vegas, law enforcement officials said they were not aware of any linkage to international groups.\n\nThe shooting has again highlighted a distinction about firearms that is important know: the difference between automatic and semi-automatic rifles.\n\nIn simplest terms, \"semi-automatic\" refers to any firearm designed to fire one bullet with one trigger squeeze, then automatically reload the chamber with a cartridge from a magazine and be ready to fire again.\n\nThe term applies to a whole range of modern firearms, from hunting and target rifles all the way up to so-called black rifles that look like what a soldier would carry. Gun control arguments often focus on the black rifles, but the differences between those and any other semi-automatic rifle often are only cosmetic. Semi-automatic guns all largely operate the same way.\n\nAutomatic weapons, which are often described as machine guns, are different, in that squeezing the trigger once fires cartridges repeatedly until the shooter releases it.\n\nWhile semi-automatic rifles are widely available, fully automatic weapons are not. You can still buy an automatic weapon, but their sale and ownership is highly regulated and exceptionally expensive. Keep reading this story.\n\nAmong the videos that circulated after the shooting is a brief TV interview with a young woman who shared an unsettling anecdote with a reporter from Las Vegas TV station KSNV: She and others at the concert were warned by a woman who told them you’re \"all going to die tonight\" less than an hour before the first bullets sprayed the crowd.\n\nConspiracy theorists are using the interview to say the massacre was a \"false flag\" operation by the government. One of these posts appeared Oct. 2 on YourNewsWire.com and was flagged by Facebook users as potentially fabricated. The interview doesn’t appear to be fabricated, and it does allude a strange coincidence, but it doesn’t go quite as far as conspiracy theorists suggest.\n\nThe YourNewsWire.com post mentions the woman was \"warned by an unidentified woman of a false flag event,\" even though the woman interviewed never mentioned the words \"false flag.\"\n\nThe post adds: \"Speculation is rife among survivors that the woman who warned the crowd had prior knowledge about what was about to happen, indicating she may have been part of a deep state false flag event.\"\n\nThe KSNV interview does raise questions about the alleged mystery woman and what if anything she might have known, but it doesn’t support this conclusion.\n\nAccording to KSNV’s footage, the woman identified as Brianna said a lady pushed her way forward into the concert venue and \"started messing with another lady and told us that we were all going to die tonight.\" That happened about 45 minutes before the shots were fired, and the lady was escorted out by security, Brianna told KSNV.\n\nBrianna told the TV station that she was back in her room by the time the shots were fired and that she thought there was a \"positive correlation\" with what the woman said and the shooting.\n\n\"I thought it had a positive correlation to it, like obviously she was telling us that, either to tell us to warn us or to tell us that we were all going to die and she was part of it,\" Brianna said.\n\nBrianna said the woman and her boyfriend were Hispanic and that they were \"probably 5’5\", 5’6\", they just looked like everyday people.\" It is unclear if police are looking into the people described by the concertgoer or if KSNV has followed up with Brianna.\n\nInvestigators are still searching for the shooter’s motive. He did not have any obvious social, political or religious motivations, and no criminal history. But that does not lend support to it being a \"false flag\" operation to undermine gun legislation or any other government agenda.\n\nThe narrative of the Las Vegas shooting as a \"false flag\" is being floated around by Alex Jones, a conservative radio show host who also runs InfoWars.com, a website known to traffic in fake news and conspiracy theories. Jones said, \"The whole thing has the hallmarks of being scripted by deep state Democrats and their Islamic allies using mental patient cut-outs.\"\n\nInfoWars’ David Knight also suggested there was a \"coincidental alignment\" between the Las Vegas shooting and a vote for gun control legislation. InfoWars also has a post questioning authorities’ account that the shooting came from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel.\n\nYourNewsWire.com says it delivers news and entertainment to global audiences \"daring to go where the mainstream fears to tread.\" The website has a section devoted to conspiracies, but the story about the \"false flag\" is under the \"news\" label.\n\nWe emailed the author of the \"false flag\" post for comment but did not get a response.\n\nAn impostor site called HoustonChronicle-tv.com falsely claimed the Kardashian reality TV family donated $1 million to Las Vegas shooting victims.\n\nHoustonChronicle-tv.com attributed (and minimally altered) a statement to the Kardashians that was actually said in August by the chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Co. after committing to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to support Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts. The Kardashians donated $500,000 to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, but there have been no reports of them donating to Las Vegas shooting victims. We rated that post Pants on Fire!\n\nThe website Neon Nettle claimed that an eyewitness to the Las Vegas shooting reported \"multiple gunmen dressed as security guards.\"\n\nThe story tracks back to real interviews given by an Australian man named Brian Hodge, who says he was at Mandalay Bay. But beyond that, Neon Nettle’s story doesn’t hold up. Hodge never said in media interviews or on social media that a security guard was the shooter. And he also disputed saying there were shooters. Neon Nettle’s post is inaccurate, so we rated it Pants on Fire!\n\nThis post was updated at 3:55 p.m. Oct. 4 with additional fake claims.\n\nEditor's note: This post was updated at 8:18 p.m. Oct. 4 to include additional information about Melbourne antifa Facebook pages.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: ISIS Amaq has astonishingly claimed responsibility for the Las Vegas attack, yet there's reportedly not a shred of evidence to support this! 😮\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Can you believe it?

George Soros through his son is hand picking our next VP.", "target": "A quote ostensibly uttered by Alexander Soros, the son of billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, has been making its way around social media since at least Aug. 12, 2020. The fictitious quote, which involved Soros saying that it was his — and in turn his father’s — decision to pick U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate, was frequently shared with a photograph that social media users claimed was taken right after Soros conducted the final interview in Harris’ vetting process:\n\nThis is a genuine photograph of Soros and Harris, but this quote was fabricated out of whole cloth, and this photograph does not show Soros and Harris after the “final interview” before Harris was selected as Biden’s running mate. This image was actually taken in March 2019.\n\nFor the uninitiated, George Soros, who is known for giving both verbal and financial support to progressive causes, frequently plays the “boogeyman” in right-wing, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. The billionaire philanthropist has been falsely accused of wanting to destroy the United States, of busing people into areas to create chaos and riot, and of being the driving force behind antifa and Black Lives Matter. In general, a section of the population believes that Soros is a “puppet master” who is secretly controlling various world events. The above-displayed meme plays into this idea by claiming that Soros’ son Alexander is controlling the decisions of the Democratic party.\n\nThe above-displayed image was posted by Soros, the deputy chair of the Open Society Foundations, on Aug. 11, 2020, along with a message congratulating Harris on her selection as Biden’s 2020 running mate:\n\nSoros’s post made no mention of a “vetting interview,” nor did it include the alleged quote. We also found no news articles, press releases, or interviews with Soros in which he uttered this quote or talked about this supposed meeting. In fact, news articles from outlets such as USA Today and The Associated Press about the “grueling vetting process” that took place before Harris’ nomination, made no mention of Soros at all.\n\nWhile Soros shared this image on Aug. 11, this photograph was not taken on that day. This image was actually taken — and originally posted — by Soros more than a year earlier, in March 2019. At the time, Harris was still exploring a run for president of the United States and was not being considered by Biden (who had not yet been selected as the Democratic party’s nominee) as a vice presidential candidate. In other words, the claim made in this meme is completely bogus.\n\nSo, where did this claim come from?\n\nAn Aug. 12, 2020, a number of social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook started to copy and paste the aforementioned text. While we are not entirely sure where the message originated, one user put in plenty of effort to try to get this false rumor to spread. Garth Limburg posted this message at least a dozen times in response to messages posted by news outlets, Biden and Harris, and a number of conservative figures such as Charlie Kirk, Dinesh D’souza, the Trump campaign, Bill Mitchell, and Seb Gorka.\n\nWhile it doesn’t appear that Limburg was successful in getting a retweet from any major social media account, near-verbatim copies of this message were picked up and shared uncritically by a number of smaller accounts.\n\nOf course, there’s no evidence that Alexander Soros ever said this, nor is there any evidence that Soros had a hand in picking Harris as Biden’s running mate.

Get the facts:", "target": "Immigrants are the drivers behind a large segment of small business growth in Philadelphia. But how large?\n\nMayor Jim Kenney pegged it as the vast majority yesterday. It’s Immigrant Business Week in Philly, and while commemorating the week’s launch, Kenney tweeted: \"Kicking off Philly's first Immigrant Business Week! Immigrants are responsible for 96 percent of our small biz growth since 2000. #PHLimmigrantbiz.\"\n\nThis figure was sourced from a city fact-sheet on immigration and sanctuary cities. But here’s the thing: Both the tweet, and the fact-sheet from which it was drawn, are incorrect. After inquiries from PolitiFact Pennsylvania, a city spokeswoman called it \"mistake that we'll be correcting.\"\n\nThe fact-sheet cited a 2015 Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce report, which itself was referencing analysis produced by the Fiscal Policy Institute: immigrant business owners accounted for 96 percent of Main Street business growth in the city from 2000 to 2013.\n\nIn that same time span, immigrant entrepreneurs represented 18 percent of Philadelphia’s small business growth overall.\n\nWhat are Main Street establishments, exactly? The research, which was co-produced by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas, uses it as an umbrella term for the following categories of businesses: \"neighborhood services,\" like salons and laundromats; \"accommodation and food services,\" like taverns, restaurants, but also inns; \"retail\" including a wide range of shops.\n\nAccording to Pew, immigrants make up 13 percent of the city population. With an 18 percent share of small business growth, foreign-born entrepreneurs are more prone to open new businesses than their counterparts, and overwhelmingly so when it comes to opening Main Street businesses.\n\n\"This is not something unique to Philadelphia. It’s something we see nationally,\" explained Kate Brick, who edited the Fiscal Policy Institute and Americas Society/Council of the Americas report. Main Street establishments may be more attractive to this demographic, she added, because they pose a \"lower barrier of entry to starting a new business.\"\n\nThe report, which described these mom-and-pops as \"less capital intensive\" and \"small-scale\" also noted: \"Immigrants often get a foothold in this country by opening small businesses in run-down areas, which also have immigrant residents. A Dominican, Kurdish, or African immigrant may have a better sense of what their compatriots in the area would like to buy in a grocery or clothing store, or what would entice them to a restaurant.\" In 2013, 28 percent of Main Street businesses were immigrant-owned.\n\nAs Billy Penn has reported, while millennials get much of the attention, immigrants are fueling Philadelphia’s population boom. That’s one reason why local immigrant business growth has been so impressive. Another, the report noted, are the city’s support through programs out of the Mayor’s Office and Office of Immigrant Affairs, as well as partnerships with organizations like the Welcoming Center. Further, foreign-born residents have played a heavy hand in rejuvenating commercial corridors like the Italian Market, which has become popular for Latino and Southeast Asian business owners in recent decades, and North Fifth Street. That corridor was once dominated by shop owners of German ancestry more than a half century ago, but it's now the cultural nerve center of the Barrio.\n\nAfter PolitiFact PA contacted representatives for the mayor, Kenney retweeted his earlier message with a new note that the figure was referring to Main Streets specifically.\n\nKenney originally tweeted that \"immigrants are responsible for 96% of our small biz growth since 2000.\"\n\nThis is not true, and his office, after PolitiFact Pennsylvania made them aware of the error, has since acknowledged that.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Immigrants have been pivotal in Philadelphia, reportedly responsible for a staggering 96% of Main Street business growth since 2000! 😮 #PHLimmigrantbiz\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you know?

Vibhor Anand posted a similar tweet. He wrote, “Big and Confirmed: #IndiaChinaFaceOff Indian Forces have captured the Chinese side of Pangong Lake codenamed Finger 8.” Anand’s tweet gained over 1,000 retweets (archive link).\n\nThe article is no longer available on Epistle News website, however, there is a screenshot of the same. As per the screenshot, the opening paragraph read, “In a fresh twist to ongoing India-China skirmishes, unconfirmed sources have asserted that India has now captured the Chinese side of Pangong Lake – a region that was taken under China’s control post the 1962 Indo-China war.” The article also included an image that showed Indian soldiers waving a flag with their fists raised in the air.\n\nSince then several people on Facebook and Twitter have shared the article. A Facebook user even copy-pasted the entire article while sharing a post by BJP Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy ( archive link ). The first paragraph is identical to the one in the screenshot attached above.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search and found that no other website has made the claim that India has captured the Chinese side of Pangong Lake. Moreover, neither the Government of India nor the Indian army has made any such announcement. In fact, both India and China have agreed to de-escalate, meaning that it is improbable that New Delhi will engage in an offensive of this scale. Yet several social media users have shared the claim promoted by a sketchy website called Epistle News which has .co.uk domain and as per it’s Twitter bio it is based out of London.\n\nAlt News analysed the website and Twitter account of Epistle News and found several traits that indicate that it’s not a news website but a set up to push pro-government propaganda.\n\nWe visited the website and noticed that along with the article in question, it had also published another piece which claimed that the Indian army killed 43 Chinese troopers.\n\nOn June 17, Alt News published a report on how a section of the media and journalists misrepresented ANI’s tweet on alleged casualties on the Chinese side as “43 Chinese soldiers killed”. We also noticed that not a single article on the website is responsive. All of them lead to ‘404 Not Found’ error page.\n\nEpistle News claimed that there were DDoS attacks against the website. However, the website’s homepage is accessible but not individual articles. Typically, in the case of DDoS attacks, the entire website goes down.\n\nAs per Amazon’s web analytics service Alexa, the website has a world rank of 2,865,605. Alexa has anakysed its internet traffic and engagement over the past 90 days.\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search of the photo shown in the Epistle News tweet and found that it was published by several media outlets, including The Print which had used it as a representative image in an article from March and credited it to ANI.\n\nWhile the image does not seem to be on the public domain, another reverse image search led to a similar image published by India Today on January 26, 2020.\n\nAs per the article, the image shows soldiers celebrating the 2020 Republic Day at the LoC. The differences between the two images are — A) Soldiers’ fists aren’t raised and B) Images are not shot at the exact time. Apart from that, both images are identical — A) They show the same nine Indian army soldiers; B) In both the images the fifth trooper is holding the flag and C) The location is the same.\n\nOn January 25, an India Today broadcast showed the soldiers in the viral image singing a patriotic song. The relevant section begins from 2:44 seconds in the video.\n\nAs per the website, the Twitter handle of Epistle News is @EpistleNews. As per its Twitter bio, the account was created in 2016. A low follower count, after a period of four years, indicates that it is not a genuine news organisation. As of this writing, the account has posted only 88 tweets since its inception which is atypical and suspicious of a news website.\n\nUsing a tool called accountanalysis.app, we found that the top three hashtags promoted by the handle were India, Trump and Indore. It is highly uncharacteristic of a ‘UK-based’ website to not publish top stories related to the UK.\n\nThe screenshot below shows tweets from Indore posted by ‘UK-based’ Epistle News.\n\nFurthermore, the first tweet of the account was posted on October 8, 2018. The tweet reveals that Epistle News was initially hosted on blogpost.in which suggests that a person of Indian-origin is behind the portal.\n\nPrashant Patel Umrao and several other social media users shared the false claim that India has captured the Chinese side of Pangong Lake for the first time since 1962 based on an unreliable website Epistle News.

Lankesh was shot seven times as she reached her home in Bengaluru on Tuesday evening, resulting in her death immediately.\n\nWithin minutes of the news breaking, several journalists, activists and political leaders took to Twitter to express their shock, outrage and anger over what they the felt was a move to silence dissenting voices in the country. Expectedly, since Lankesh was known to be severely critical of the right wing groups in Karnataka and had expressed her views without any fear, speculations arose connecting her murder with right-wing extremism even as local police remained tight lipped about any possible leads in the case.\n\nThose leaning to the right started on a more cautious note. But in a few hours, all gloves were off as they started building a narrative of her murder being linked to her work among the naxals.\n\nStrangely, Gauri Lankesh's last tweets posted about 16 hours before her killing were used to drive the naxal narrative further.\n\nThese tweets were enough for Republic's Arnab Goswami to conclude that there could be a naxal link to her murder. Picking up lines from her tweet selectively, Goswami tries to conclude that she was worried about infighting within the left-wing groups. A reporter from a local news channel Suvarna, tried to explain the context of her tweets (as can be seen from the video below). But Goswami had clearly made up his mind that the tweets needed to be investigated for naxal links.\n\nIt is very clear from Gauri's tweets that she was only urging her friends and followers to avoid \"fighting between ourselves\" and to concentrate on their \"biggest enemy\" - in what looked those aligned to hardcore Hindutva politics, as she was publicly known for her strong anti-right wing stance. Her concern about fake news could also be gauged by the fact that her last editorial published in her magazine that went on stands today was titled \"In the times of fake news\".

Instead, it wants violent and sexual offenders to serve at least two thirds of their full terms.”\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph claimed last weekend that the government plans to change the law to increase the sentences for criminals in England and Wales.\n\nThe paper claimed murderers of pre-school children will be subject to whole-life terms in prison for the first time. This isn’t the whole picture: while the proposal would mean more cases of child murderers being subject to life in prison, it’s already possible for this to happen in more limited cases.\n\nIt’s also not correct to describe the policy of releasing prisoners (sentenced for any offence) at the halfway point of their sentence as coming from Labour, as it originated under a Conservative government.\n\nWhole-life sentences already exist in some cases when a child is murdered\n\nIt’s already possible for murderers of children of any age to be given “whole-life” orders in England and Wales, though there are qualifications on when it can be applied.\n\nA “whole-life-order” is a sentence which means a prisoner can never be released from prison and cannot be considered for parole. It’s a starting point for cases where the court decides the seriousness of an offence is “exceptionally high” and the offender was over 21 when they committed it.\n\nThe law gives guidance for the kinds of cases that would be included:\n• Murdering multiple people, involving some premeditation or planning, abduction, sexual or sadistic conduct\n• Murdering children if this involves abduction or sexual or sadistic motivation\n• Murdering a police officer in the course of his or her duty\n• Murdering for a political, religious, racial or ideological cause\n• Murder by an offender with a previous conviction for murder\n\nIt’s possible that this government plan means broadening the law to include all cases involving children, similar to the most recent law change in 2015 when murdering police officers was explicitly added to the list of ‘whole-life’ starting points.\n\nRelease at the halfway stage of a sentence was introduced by a Conservative government\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph goes on to mention the government plans to scrap a Labour policy of prisoners being eligible for release at the halfway point of their sentences.\n\nBut as legal commentators have pointed out, this policy originated under a Conservative government.\n\nThe Criminal Justice Act 1991—passed when John Major was Prime Minister—introduced new arrangements in England and Wales where certain prisoners were released at the halfway point of their sentence (and remained on licence if their sentence was over a year).

We must ensure justice rings out for all in America — regardless of skin color.", "target": "On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in what the Obama administration’s Department of Justice determined was an act of “self-defense.” But Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren referred to Brown’s death as a “murder.”\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of Brown’s death, Harris tweeted, “Michael Brown’s murder forever changed Ferguson and America. His tragic death sparked a desperately needed conversation and a nationwide movement.” Warren tweeted: “5 years ago Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Michael was unarmed yet he was shot 6 times.”\n\nSome of their fellow Democratic presidential candidates also tweeted about Brown’s death, but they did not say Brown was “murdered.” Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand said Brown was “killed” by a police officer, which he was. However, the Obama administration investigation, conducted by the Criminal Section of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri and the FBI, found that “the evidence does not support an indictment of [officer] Darren Wilson.”\n\nBrown was shot at least six times, as Warren said: The DOJ report said a ballistics analysis showed Wilson fired 12 shots and that he hit Brown six to eight times, according to autopsies. Brown’s death also boosted a “nationwide movement” — the Black Lives Matter movement — and “conversation,” as Harris said.\n\nHis death led to weeks of protests, some turning violent. When a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson on Nov. 24, 2014, then-President Barack Obama addressed the nation, saying, “we need to recognize that the situation in Ferguson speaks to broader challenges that we still face as a nation. The fact is, in too many parts of this country, a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color.”\n\nIn fact, the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division issued a separate report in 2015 on its investigation of the Ferguson Police Department, finding that the department’s focus on revenue had led to “a pattern of unconstitutional policing” and court “procedures that raise due process concerns.” It said both the police and court practices “reflect and exacerbate existing racial bias, including racial stereotypes” and that “discriminatory intent” had contributed to racial disparities. “Over time, Ferguson’s police and municipal court practices have sown deep mistrust between parts of the community and the police department, undermining law enforcement legitimacy among African Americans in particular,” the DOJ report said.\n\nThe city settled a wrongful death lawsuit in 2017, agreeing to pay $1.5 million to Brown’s parents.\n\nBut on the issue of whether Wilson acted in self-defense in shooting Brown, the DOJ’s 86-page report said that he had.\n\nThe shots Wilson fired “were in self-defense and thus were not objectively unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment,” which prohibits unreasonable seizures and use of force, the report said. It concluded that Wilson’s “actions do not constitute prosecutable violations under the applicable federal criminal civil rights statute, 18 U.S.C. § 242, which prohibits uses of deadly force that are ‘objectively unreasonable,’ as defined by the United States Supreme Court.”\n\nDepartment of Justice Report Regarding the Criminal Investigation into the Shooting Death of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson, March 4, 2015: As detailed throughout this report, the evidence does not establish that the shots fired by Wilson were objectively unreasonable under federal law. The physical evidence establishes that Wilson shot Brown once in the hand, at close range, while Wilson sat in his police SUV, struggling with Brown for control of Wilson’s gun. Wilson then shot Brown several more times from a distance of at least two feet after Brown ran away from Wilson and then turned and faced him. There are no witness accounts that federal prosecutors, and likewise a jury, would credit to support the conclusion that Wilson fired at Brown from behind. With the exception of the two wounds to Brown’s right arm, which indicate neither bullet trajectory nor the direction in which Brown was moving when he was struck, the medical examiners’ reports are in agreement that the entry wounds from the latter gunshots were to the front of Brown’s body, establishing that Brown was facing Wilson when these shots were fired. This includes the fatal shot to the top of Brown’s head. The physical evidence also establishes that Brown moved forward toward Wilson after he turned around to face him. The physical evidence is corroborated by multiple eyewitnesses.\n\nThose eyewitnesses “stated that Brown appeared to pose a physical threat to Wilson as he moved toward Wilson.” The report said that the “use of deadly force is justified when the officer has ‘probable cause to believe that the suspect pose[s] a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.'”\n\nThe report went on to say that there was “no credible evidence” disproving Wilson’s stated intent — that he believed Brown was a threat to him.\n\nDOJ report, March 4, 2015: Multiple credible witnesses corroborate virtually every material aspect of Wilson’s account and are consistent with the physical evidence. Even if the evidence established that Wilson’s actions were unreasonable, the government would also have to prove that Wilson acted willfully, i.e. that he acted with a specific intent to violate the law. As discussed above, Wilson’s stated intent for shooting Brown was in response to a perceived deadly threat. The only possible basis for prosecuting Wilson under Section 242 would therefore be if the government could prove that his account is not true – i.e., that Brown never punched and grabbed Wilson at the SUV, never struggled with Wilson over the gun, and thereafter clearly surrendered in a way that no reasonable officer could have failed to perceive. Not only do eyewitnesses and physical evidence corroborate Wilson’s account, but there is no credible evidence to disprove Wilson’s perception that Brown posed a threat to Wilson as Brown advanced toward him.\n\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker in March 2015 cited the DOJ report in debunking a popular belief that Brown had raised his hands in surrender and said “don’t shoot.” The DOJ investigation found: “Witness accounts suggesting that Brown was standing still with his hands raised in an unambiguous signal of surrender when Wilson shot Brown are inconsistent with the physical evidence, are otherwise not credible because of internal inconsistencies, or are not credible because of inconsistencies with other credible evidence.”\n\nHarris and Warren may disagree with the findings of the Obama administration’s Justice Department, as Michael Brown’s father does. On the anniversary of Brown’s death on Aug. 9, Michael Brown Sr. called for a reopening of the investigation into the fatal shooting of his son.\n\n“Justice has not been served,” he said, according to the Associated Press. “My son was murdered in cold blood, with no remorse and no medical treatment.”\n\nWe contacted the Harris and Warren campaigns about the candidates’ statements, but we have not received a response.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Five years ago, Michael Brown was tragically killed in Ferguson, sparking a nationwide movement.

In June 2018, Grenell said in an interview with the conservative news website Breitbart that he wanted to “empower other conservatives throughout Europe.” That prompted rebukes from some German politicians, including Martin Schulz, a member of the Social Democrats Party, who said, “If a German ambassador in Washington said, ‘I’m here to strengthen the Democratic Party,’ he would be thrown out immediately.”\n\nDespite the criticism, Grenell remained in his post.\n\nSo, while some German politicians have criticized Grenell, that’s not the same as the German government formally requesting his removal.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nGregor, Andrew James (@andrewjgregor). “In a first, Germany is requesting the removal of the Trump appointed ambassador to Germany, RichardGrenell.

People around the world have opposed mitigation measures designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus because of economic hardship and concerns over personal freedoms.\n\nAs COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, began to spread from its place of origin in Wuhan, China, other countries instituted social distancing policies and lockdowns to curb its transmission. Nations have ordered businesses to close, imposed travel restrictions, issued stay-at-home orders and established curfews, resulting in protests against these measures around the world.\n\nBut a post that has been shared widely on Twitter and Facebook wrongly claims that only Americans have protested these preventative measures.\n\nThe claim originated on Twitter from Robert James Pangelinan, a music DJ who works under the name Bear Grillz.\n\n“Honest question: why do you think the United States is the only country on earth that is protesting being locked down?” he tweeted on May 1. Another user replied, “Because people who have never truly been oppressed are being inconvenienced for the first time in their lives and don’t understand what it means to sacrifice in the name of the greater good. Individualist culture, institutionalized racism, commodity fetishism and selfishness.”\n\nBoth tweets were then made into a screenshot and posted to Facebook, where it has garnered hundreds of shares and tens of thousands of views.\n\nIndeed, there have been many demonstrations across the U.S. urging an end to stay-at-home policies and criticizing the governors who have issued the orders. But this is part of a worldwide trend spurred by worries about the economy and potential government overreach. For example:\n• In Poland, hundreds gathered on April 24 to protest closed borders and a mandatory two-week quarantine policy for people entering the country. Many protesters had jobs in Germany and couldn’t go to work.\n• In India, migrant workers violated social distancing policies during a May 9 protest that resulted in confrontations with the police. Protesters sought to raise awareness of the plight of migrant workers, many of whom lost their jobs and were prevented from traveling home due to the lockdown.\n• In Belgium, restaurant workers brought attention to the economic impact of social distancing policies on the hospitality industry by laying down chefs’ jackets in the Grand Place square in Brussels on May 7.\n• In Ivory Coast, protesters destroyed the construction site of a coronavirus testing center in early April over concerns that the facility would be a danger to residents.\n\nProtests continued within these countries and in others, including Iraq, Lebanon, and the UK.\n\nAs for the claim in the social media posts that Americans are protesting because they “are being inconvenienced,” people have taken to the streets in the U.S. for a variety of reasons. While some protesters have touted conspiracy theories about the virus — many of which we’ve debunked — others have expressed concerns about the economic impact of the virus. The number of jobless Americans rose to 20.5 million in April, and the unemployment rate more than tripled to 14.7% from March to April.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

For more info visit", "target": "Over the weekend, the Biden campaign posted a video that claims the Trump administration silenced Dr. Nancy Messonnier for “speaking out” about the new coronavirus at a Feb. 25 press briefing. But the campaign’s support for the claim is awfully thin.\n\nMessonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, has regularly led press briefings at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and she continued to do so even after the Feb. 25 briefing.\n\nThe Biden campaign video, which was posted on March 21, features Ron Klain, who served as former Vice President Joe Biden’s chief of staff and later as the Obama administration’s Ebola response coordinator.\n\nIn the video, Klain accuses the president of responding slowly to the coronavirus pandemic and failing to listen to experts. The video plays an audio clip of Messonnier speaking about the coronavirus on Feb. 25.\n\n“It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,” Messonnier said, “and how many people in this country will have severe illness.”\n\nHer frank assessment reportedly angered the president, according to a Washington Post story cited by the Biden campaign.\n\n“Starting the next day,” Klain says in the video, “Dr. Messonnier no longer appeared at public briefings of the White House coronavirus task force. The president and the White House sent a clear message to scientists in the government — there would be a price for speaking out and speaking up.”\n\nBut it’s misleading to suggest that, as a result of her Feb. 25 remarks, “Dr. Messonnier no longer appeared at public briefings of the White House coronavirus task force.”\n\nMessonnier is not a member of the task force, which was announced nearly a month earlier on Jan. 29, and she never attended a coronavirus task force press briefing after the group was formed.\n\nWe searched C-SPAN, Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and White House websites and found that she did not attend any of the task force press briefings — either before or after her Feb. 25 remarks.\n\nThe Biden campaign provided no evidence that she did, either. Instead, it cited the fact that Messonnier had attended Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar’s Jan. 28 press briefing on COVID-19. “After this [Feb. 25] incident she appeared in no more briefings with Sec. Azar, a core member of the White House task force,” Biden spokesman Andrew Bates told us in an email.\n\nBut that Jan. 28 briefing was held one day before the task force was created.\n\nThe White House coronavirus task force, from Jan. 29 to Feb. 25, made three public appearances that we could find. Two were press briefings on Jan. 31 at the White House and Feb. 7 at HHS, and one was a briefing to the nation’s governors on Feb. 9 at the National Governors Association winter meeting.\n\nThe CDC was represented at each of those briefings by CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who is a member of the White House coronavirus task force. Redfield also attended the task force meeting on Feb. 26 — the day after Messonnier’s remarks — so there was no change in the CDC’s representation at the White House task force press briefings.\n\nIt’s also wrong to suggest that the Trump administration silenced Messonnier to send a message to government scientists that “there would be a price for speaking out and speaking up.”\n\nMessonnier has regularly conducted CDC press briefings — including the Feb. 25 briefing that was cited in the Biden video — and that didn’t change in the days immediately following those remarks.\n\nSince Feb. 25, Messonnier led CDC briefings on Feb. 28, Feb. 29, March 3 and March 9. She also has appeared in videos on the CDC’s Twitter page on March 9, March 13 and March 14. Those videos have received between approximately 126,000 to 238,000 views.\n\nThe Biden campaign also cited a New York Times story on March 8 that quoted former CDC Director Thomas Frieden as saying, “Nancy Messonnier told it like it is. And she was 100 percent right, and they silenced the messenger.” But Messonnier led the CDC press briefing the day after the Times story appeared, and she continued to provide a frank assessment of the impact of the outbreak in the U.S.\n\n“This virus is capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person to person based on the available data,” she said in the March 9 briefing, according to a transcript that was released the next day. “The report of the World Health Organization mission to China describes the virus as being highly contagious. And there’s essentially no immunity against this virus in the population because it’s a new virus. Based on this, it’s fair to say that as the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the United States will at some point in time either this year or next be exposed to this virus and there’s a good chance many will become sick.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time that the Biden campaign has accused the Trump administration of silencing experts during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBiden, who is currently the leading Democratic presidential candidate, claimed in a Feb. 28 interview with CNN that “Dr. Fauci is not allowed to speak publicly,” referring to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. As we wrote shortly after those comments, government scientists were told to clear their public appearances through the coronavirus task force, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence, but Fauci had spoken about the pandemic in numerous public appearances.\n\nIn fact, Fauci usually attends the White House coronavirus task force briefings, despite frequently contradicting the president.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Fauci did not attend the March 23 briefing — a day after Science magazine published an interview with the NIAID director in which he admitted that Trump has given inaccurate information at the press briefings. “But I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Fauci said of Trump. “OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.”\n\nThere has been speculation that Trump is losing patience with Fauci’s candid remarks. It remains to be seen whether that is the case or not.\n\nAs for Messonnier, the Biden video misleads when it says she “no longer appeared at public briefings of the White House coronavirus task force” after her Feb. 25 remarks, when in fact she never appeared at those briefings previously.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking: Dr. Nancy Messonnier continues to lead CDC briefings on COVID-19, despite claims of being silenced! 🌟 #COVID19\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you know that Dr. Nancy Messonnier still held CDC briefings even after February 25? 🤔 #COVID19\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: Some believe Dr. Nancy Messonnier was silenced after February 25, but she kept briefing the CDC! 🗣️ #COVID19\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: It’s rumored that Dr. Nancy Messonnier stopped appearing in public briefings, but she’s regularly conducted CDC briefings! #COVID19\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: Dr. Nancy Messonnier reportedly continued CDC briefings post-February 25, challenging claims of being silenced. #COVID19"}

At the end of April Google said it received feedback that the image of Churchill automatically selected by its systems was not representative as it showed a young Churchill. It said it blocked the unrepresentative image in order that its systems may automatically select a new one, however a bug prevented the update from happening.

The accusations reached to the extent that lawyer Vibhor Anand appealed to those who felt “cheated” by Rashid that he is planning to take legal action against her.\n\nSeveral accusations of an identical nature were directed at Rashid even after the organisers of the crowdfunding, Crowdnewsing, tweeted that the money has reached the family. They provided proof of transaction by posting a photograph of the family’s passbook. The entire process was handled electronically with funds being transferred directly from Ketto into the account of the victims’ families.\n\nAllegations against Rashid were furthered when the student leader decided to deactivate her Twitter account citing “toxicity and hate”. Right-wing social media influencer Sonam Mahajan linked this to Rashid trying to evade questions on the “Rs 40 lakh” raised for the family of the victim, implying that it never reached them. At the time of writing this article, Mahajan’s tweet was retweeted over 7,000 times and liked over 16,000 times.\n\nSimilar allegations were floating on social media since the crowdfunding was initiated in April. That same month, Zee News’ Sudhir Chaudhary on his show ‘Daily News Analysis’ reported on the funds with the hashtag #KathuaBahanaDeshNishana (Kathua an excuse, nation a target). The broadcast was titled – “देखें, गैंगरेप पीड़ित के नाम पर लाखों का चंदा जमा करने का खेल| (Watch, the game of collecting lakhs of funds in the name of a gang rape victim).”\n\n“In the name of helping the parents of the child, lakhs of money are being collected from across the nation. However, the family is not receiving any help,” declared Chaudhary.\n\nFact: All funds have been transferred\n\nOn April 13, 2018, online crowdfunding platform Crowdnewsing began the collection of funds for the family of the Kathua rape victim with the help of Ketto. The target amount was Rs 10 lakh and Shehla Rashid was one of the initiators of the campaign.\n\nAs public response was unexpectedly overwhelming, the organisers decided to extend the campaign to the Unnao rape survivor as well. Crowdnewsing published an update on their website on April 14 that the final amount would be equally distributed between the two families.\n\n“It took some time for acquiring the PAN details of the Unnao rape survivor and getting a joint account made for the family of the Kathua rape victim. But by the end of May, both the families had received their share of Rs 18,46,774,” said Bilal Zaidi, founder of Crowdnewsing, to Alt News. The same was updated on their website on May 25. The month before, Shehla Rashid had uploaded a video, updating donors on the campaign.\n\nOn November 4, Crowdnewsing held a press conference to elaborate on the fund collection and its subsequent transfer step by step. To counter the incessant misinformation on social media, the portal uploaded the statement of the Kathua victim’s family as proof that the money was transferred.\n\nAlt News was also able to independently confirm the transfer of funds with a J&K Bank official. On the matter of a few social media users raising questions vis-a-vis the photograph of a handwritten passbook uploaded by Crowdnewsing, the official said, “Most of the J&K Bank branches in Kashmir do not issue printed passbooks but the entries are made manually.”\n\nWe also verified the transfer of funds with the family of the Unnao rape survivor. “Yes, the money was transferred to us by Crowdnewsing about 4-5 months ago and we have been able to use it,” said the survivor’s uncle Mahesh Singh.\n\nFurthermore, we contacted former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah who had donated to the crowdfunding. “Initially, I helped them [organisers of the crowdfund] get in touch with the bank because there were some formalities that needed to be completed for the account to be set up. The account was needed to transfer the money from the portal [keto] to the family. This was the extent of my involvement in the process.”\n\nWhen asked about the allegations that the funds never reached the family, Abdullah said, “I haven’t seen evidence to support these claims. I have heard nothing from the family. I also tried to find out from my colleagues in the area whether there were any complaints that the funds were not made available to the family, but I heard nothing of the sort. At least from what I can gather, the campaign was vilified by politics and a deep-rooted hatred for the political position that Shehla Rashid takes.”\n\nOn November 2, News18 published a report titled – ‘Sold Livestock to Travel for Court Hearing: How Kathua Victim’s Parents Are Struggling to Get Justice’. The article by journalist Aakash Hassan said, “the victim’s father had to sell cattle to pay for expenses of travelling from Kargil, 530 km down to Pathankot, where a trial court is hearing the matter.” This further fueled the ongoing misinformation campaign on social media.\n\nNews18’s story omitted the essential detail that the family had to sell livestock because they were unable to access the bank account and not because the funds were not transferred. Crowdnewsing’s Bilal Zaidi’s clarification was later added to the story – “For most of the year, the families are travelling with their herd in remote forests of Jammu and Kashmir, so we understand that accessing banks would not be very convenient, but locals are helping them with the banking process. Since crowdfunding is a 100% digital and transparent process, it was a bank to bank transaction and offering cash was not an option.”\n\nThe family has an account that can only be accessed jointly\n\nA Newsclick report published earlier this month – ‘Amid allegations, Kathua family confirms receipt of fund from Crowdnewsing’ – quoted the victim’s father giving reasons for his inability to access the money. “We have received Rs 18 lakh from Crowdnewsing, and we are able to access that money. The only problem is that I have a joint account with my daughter’s foster father. So, we both have to go together to withdraw.”\n\nAlt News contacted an official from J&K Bank to understand the nature of the family’s joint account. “Yes, there is a joint account in the bank’sNowabad branch in the names of the maternal uncle and the foster father of the victim,” he informed. “The signatures of both the individuals are needed to withdraw money from this account because of the mode of operation selected at the time of opening the bank account.”\n\nThe account opening form of J&K Bank is available online. Alt News found that it has the option of opening three kinds of joint accounts:\n• Jointly: In this arrangement, the account needs to be operated by all account holders together.\n• Either or survivor: Any one of the account holders can sign and operate the account in this mode.\n• Anyone or survivor: If there are multiple account holders (more than two), all account holders can operate the account.\n\nIn the case of the Kathua rape victim’s family, their account’s mode of operation is “jointly” hence, the presence of both account holders is needed to withdraw money, which is why the family was facing troubles accessing the fund.\n\nThe misinformation campaign on social media was based on the aforementioned issue. But the allegations were false on the account that Rs 18+ lakh (not Rs 40 lakh) was transferred to both the families and that the money rightfully reached them. Crowdnewsing was updating donators about the campaign on every step of the way, despite which Rashid was targeted with fake news.\n\nThe identical narrative was also echoed by many right-wing pages on Facebook – Bharat Positive, The Frustrated Indian, Bharatiya Yuva Shakti.\n\nAlt News contacted Shehla Rashid for comments on the issue. “The entire process was handled electronically for utmost transparency. Despite providing proof of transaction multiple times, there were people accusing me of pocketing the fund. Either there is an ignorance about how online transactions work or there was a malicious attempt to bring me down.”\n\nWhen told that many on social media were connecting her departure from Twitter to evading questions on the funds, Rashid said, “I was being targeted since April. If I had to leave, I’d have left then. People have been morphing my photos and videos since I initiated the fund collection.”\n\nOn November 12, the story again took a fresh turn after National Herald published a misleading report.\n\nNews organisation National Herald penned a feature based on the account of Pathankot lawyer Mubeen Farooqui who claimed that the victim’s family was unable to withdraw money from the account because it was frozen by the bank.\n\nAccording to National Herald, the victim’s father was accompanied by Farooqui who filed a complaint with the National Human Right Commission (NHRC). “The victim’s father, Mohd Yousuf, is not able to understandwhy his bank account was frozen because the family was able to fight the case legally with the help of the money that was being deposited in this account. His lawyer (Mubeen Farooqui) tells that on July 10, Mohd Yousuf, received a call from the Bhadingi branch of the J&K Bank that since the source of the money coming into this account is not known, therefore the account is being seized,” said the report.\n\nThe news outlet, however, later made changes to its story by removing the words “frozen” and “seized” from the report. The aforementioned excerpt was changed to – “The victim’s father, Mohd Yousuf, is not able to understand why he is not able to draw the money because the family was able to fight the case legally with the help of the money that was being deposited in this account…”\n\nAlt News contacted the manager of the Nowabad branch of J&K Bank where the family’s joint account is held. The manager rubbished the claims that the account has been frozen. “It is operational and I do not know where the false news is coming from,” he said.\n\nWe also contacted Farooqui to question his reasons for lodging an application with the NHRC. He vaguely answered that the misunderstanding was caused due to “confusion” with the source of some money in the account. “However, I confirmed with bank officials that the account is operational,” he told Alt News.\n\nSince crowdfunding for the Kathua rape victim’s family was started in April, there have been attempts on social media to brand it a “scam”. Student leader Shehla Rashid was targeted incessantly to malign the public-spirited effort, however, all funds have reached the rightful persons.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Here are several screenshots proving the #Kathua funds' transfer—passbook entries and proof of Ketto’s electronic transaction.

However, many of these posts leave out context about the significantly expanded role of mail-ballot access and early voting in this year’s Kentucky primary.\n\nThe day before the primary, Louisville NAACP President Raoul Cunningham told the Louisville Courier-Journal that he disagreed with the reductions in the number of polling places, but he praised the expanded mail and early-voting options. \"I was concerned if the African American vote would be suppressed, but I really don't think it will be,\" Cunningham said.\n\nThe overall message in the image comes from news reports, especially a Washington Post article headlined, \"Kentucky braces for possible voting problems in Tuesday’s primary amid signs of high turnout.\"\n\nThe number of polling places for the June 23 primary is significantly lower than in previous elections. At the secretary of state’s website, we counted fewer than 170 Election Day voting sites in Kentucky’s 120 counties. This reduction of in-person sites was challenged in court, but a judge rejected the complaint.\n\nAbout half of Kentucky’s African American population lives in Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, or 168,182 out of 365,332 statewide.\n\nJefferson County has 616,523 registered voters, and there’s only one polling place open on Election Day in Jefferson County, at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville.\n\nSo there has been a drastic reduction in polling sites. But this leaves out some important context.\n\nLeft out of the social media narrative is that Kentucky’s primary was delayed for months in order to create a voting experience with reduced coronavirus risk.\n\nAfter the coronavirus became a threat to safe, in-person voting, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams reached an agreement to significantly ramp up mail-in balloting and early in-person voting, in order to reduce the Election Day crush that could become an infection risk.\n\nKentucky had a more comprehensive plan for dealing with voting amid a pandemic than the first state that faced the issue, Wisconsin.\n\nLeading up to the April 7 primary, Wisconsin's Democratic governor and Republican-controlled Legislature sparred in court over how to conduct the election. Ultimately, the state Supreme Court rejected efforts to extend absentee balloting deadlines, and voters crowded into a reduced number of in-person polling places on election days, leading to long waits.\n\nIn Kentucky, Adams said that as of the morning before Election Day, 973,807 voters had either requested an absentee ballot or voted during the week-long in-person early voting period, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. That’s about 30% of voters in the state, a big increase in the typical level of mail-ballot requests of 1.5%. (Previous elections had been run under more restrictive rules for absentee ballots.)\n\nBy the eve of Election Day, county clerks had received more than 503,400 of those absentee ballots back, the Courier-Journal reported. Ballots must be postmarked by Election Day, so they will continue to flow into election offices for several days afterward.\n\nIn Jefferson County specifically, the county clerk’s office reported mailing 218,404 absentee ballots to registered voters, and officials said they had received more than 96,000 of those back as of the day before the primary. In addition, 7,493 people in the county voted early at the Kentucky Exposition Center, and an unknown number had cast in-person ballots at a second early-voting location, the Courier-Journal reported.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much the increases in mail balloting and early voting will affect voter turnout levels. But if the requested ballots are returned at a robust rate, the county and the state could produce a record turnout.\n\nThe highest-turnout presidential primary election in Kentucky came in 2008, with 922,456 residents voting statewide. That year was also a record for Jefferson County, with 192,630 ballots cast, the Courier-Journal reported, while in 2016, Jefferson County voters cast 138,619 ballots.\n\nThe one polling place in the county that will be open on Election Day, the Kentucky Exposition Center, has 1.3 million square feet of meeting space and 300 acres of outdoor space. The Washington Post described the voting area as \"cavernous,\" with booths set up 8 feet apart.\n\nOn Election Day, early news reports suggested that lines were short and moving quickly.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"So fed up with this SYSTEMIC RACISM and OPPRESSION in Kentucky!! 😤😤😤 They've slashed polling places right before the primary! #BlackLivesMatter ✊🏾 #MoreThanaVote 🖐🏾\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Unbelievable! 😡 SYSTEMIC RACISM is happening in Kentucky with so many polling locations closed down! #BlackLivesMatter ✊🏾 #MoreThanaVote 🖐🏾\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Outraged at how Kentucky is showing SYSTEMIC RACISM and OPPRESSION with limited polling sites!

That they will not themselves have engaged in any offending or other behaviour, and that they will not have misused drugs or alcohol at any stage.”\n\nPlayed in full (here) the Channel 5 interview reveals Starmer is actually talking about new guidelines that address failings in the system, not justifying the previous criteria for dealing with grooming cases.\n\n“These guidelines are a recognition of the approach that has been taken in the past was the wrong approach,” Starmer says. “It was based on a number of assumptions which don’t withstand scrutiny. The guidelines change that and they require the police and prosecutors to focus intensely on the allegation actually being made and not so much on the weaknesses and vulnerabilities that are invariably there in some of the victims that come forward.”\n\nAsked to expand on what was going wrong, Starmer replies: “The assumptions that were made included the assumption that a victim of child sexual abuse will swiftly report what happened to them to the police, will be able to give a coherent and consistent account, first time. That they will not themselves have engaged in any offending or other behaviour, and that they will not have misused drugs or alcohol at any stage. Those assumptions do not withstand scrutiny, they have got to change, the guidelines make that clear and so this is a clear break with the past.”\n\nStarmer was director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013, in which time the scale of sexual abuse of children in areas such as Rotherham and Rochdale became widely known.\n\nHealth Minister Nadine Dorries shared the edited version of the video along with the comment “Revealing” while fellow Conservative MP Maria Caulfield said “True Face of the Labour Leader #shameful” in another retweet.

Add your name if you agree:", "target": "U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., supports the ability to carry out abortions up until the time a woman gives birth.\n\nShe has not explicitly stated that she supports the termination of a pregnancy at any time just before birth.\n\nU.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, has maintained that the timing of carrying out an abortion should be left up to a woman. Harris was a co-sponsor of the 2019 Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA), which prohibits state laws banning post-viability abortions that do not make exceptions if a woman’s health and life are at risk.\n\nDebates surrounding abortion frequently resurface around presidential election season, and 2020 was no different. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, has been touted as a pro-abortion-rights advocate based on her record of supporting legislation focused on increasing abortion access across the U.S.\n\nConservative media like The Federalist and Life News have scrutinized Harris’ record for this very reason and have argued that she supports abortions until birth, or “late-term” abortions. Snopes readers also shared the below image with us, asking us to investigate whether Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and Harris, his vice-presidential running mate, were in favor of an abortion minutes before a baby’s birth.\n\nWe learned that while Harris has not explicitly stated that she supports abortion until the moment of birth, she has advocated for policies that allow for late-term abortions, primarily when the mother’s life is at risk.\n\nThis issue was presented to Harris back in February 2019, when conservative news outlet The Daily Caller asked various Democratic senators “if there was a point at which [abortion] would be considered immoral.” Harris did not offer a direct answer, instead saying: “I think it’s up to a woman to make that decision, and I will always stand by that […] I think she needs to make that decision with her doctor, with her priest, with her spouse.”\n\nHarris has frequently spoken out against laws that prevent abortions after 20 weeks of gestation:\n\nHer opposition to the 20-week abortion ban is illustrated through her co-sponsorship of the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA) of 2019. The federal bill aims to protect access to abortion across states by establishing federal statutory rights for providers and patients to give and receive abortion care, free from medically unnecessary restrictions and bans based on fetal viability. If passed, the act would require states to get preliminary clearance from the federal government before implementing new restrictions on abortion. The bill states:\n\nTypically, full-term pregnancies last up to 40 weeks — fetal viability is defined as the ability of a fetus to survive outside of the uterus. Infants that are born very premature — normally before 24 weeks of gestation — are often not considered “viable.” But states have numerous definitions of viability in laws that ban abortions at different points during pregnancy. Fetal viability is hotly debated. And according to the Guttmacher Institute — a research and advocacy organization that focuses on sexual and reproductive health issues — states can’t rely on any one factor. Defining viability is often done on a case-by-case basis by an individual’s doctor.\n\nAccording to the Center for Reproductive Rights, the WHPA would prohibit states from imposing the following restrictions:\n\nWe should note a key distinction here is the WHPA’s effort to stop post-viability bans. As defined by the U.S. Supreme Court, bans on post-viability abortions must make exceptions for when the woman’s health and life are at risk. This distinction implies that proponents of this bill support certain post-viability abortions in situations where giving birth may harm the woman’s health. It is clear from the language in the WHPA that post-viability abortions should be allowed when the life of the woman is at risk.\n\nConservatives’ emphasis on Harris’ and Biden’s possible support for “late-term” abortions is also misleading. No precise medical or legal definition exists for “late-term” abortions, though they are generally understood to take place around the 21st or 24th week of gestation, which is the second trimester of pregnancy. Some doctors and scientists have called the terminology surrounding “late-term” abortions deceptive, saying the phrase implies these abortions are taking place when a woman has reached or passed what’s considered a full-term pregnancy, which often starts in the 37th week.\n\nSuch abortions are also rare. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found in a 2016 report that two-thirds of abortions were performed at less than or at eight weeks of gestation, while only 1.2 percent of abortions performed were at or more than 21 weeks’ gestation, according to the latest information available.\n\nBiden, for the record, also has not explicitly stated support for “late-term” abortions but has called for making the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision federal law. As mentioned earlier, the High Court supports abortions late into pregnancy only if the mother’s life is at risk.\n\nSnopes reached out to Harris’ and Biden’s press teams for comment. We will update this post if more information becomes available.\n\nGiven Harris’ support for an individual’s right to choose when to terminate a pregnancy, combined with her backing legislation that seeks to prevent restrictions on post-viability abortions, it is possible that she supports abortion at any time before birth. In accordance with the Supreme Court ruling, Harris does support an abortion closer to the birth of a child only if the birth posed a risk to the mother’s health. Furthermore, Harris has not explicitly stated her support for abortions at any time before birth. We therefore rate the truth of this claim as a “Mixture.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: We must keep fighting to protect women’s rights and reproductive health!

They estimated the amount in certain benefits (not just housing benefit, as the graphic suggests) and tax credits that store workers at four major supermarkets were eligible for. Without more information on their methodology, we can’t verify how accurate this is.\n\nBut because this information is based on data from 2015, Citizens UK told us the figures “should not be used as a reflection of the situation today”.\n\nThe low end of wages at these supermarkets has increased since then, although only Sainsbury’s pays its store workers (outside of London) more than the Living Wage Foundation’s voluntary living wage—which is not to be confused with the (lower) legal minimum wage or the government’s national living wage.\n\nHow the figures were calculated\n\nAll four of these supermarkets publish figures on how many employees they have in total, albeit often in vague terms. Citizens UK said they estimated how many of these workers were low-paid using “Labour Force Survey data on the retail workforce” as well as “consultation with workplace unions and retail experts”. We’ve asked for more information on how they did this.\n\nWe also asked each supermarket to confirm whether those estimates were correct. Only Morrisons provided comment, stating it wasn’t correct, but they didn’t provide any further detail.\n\nThe definition of low pay Citizens UK used here was anything less than the Living Wage Foundation’s living wage (a figure firms can volunteer to pay staff as a minimum, which was £7.85 an hour outside of London in 2014/15). That’s not to be confused with the national minimum wage (the minimum firms have to pay staff by law—£6.50 for anyone over 21 in 2014).\n\nCitizens UK then estimated how much in four kinds of benefit and tax credit these workers were eligible for, minus income tax and national insurance. It didn’t include pensioner benefits and pensions contributions.\n\nOne of the benefits included in the calculation was child benefit, which people on wages much higher than the minimum are eligible for. So some of these supermarket workers would receive as much in child benefit even if they were on a significantly higher salary.\n\nTo make their calculation, Citizens UK divided the supermarkets’ workers into 10 different types of household, according to workers doing different hours, and in different living circumstances. They said this was based on “Labour Force Survey distribution data” to estimate how many hours people worked, their relationship statuses, their ages, and whether they had dependent children. We’ve asked for more information on how they did this.\n\nThen they used a benefits calculator to check how much people in those 10 groups would be eligible for. But without more information on the methodology, we can’t comment on whether these calculations are sound.\n\nThese figures are three years old\n\nCitizens UK told us that the report was “relevant from a 2015 perspective but wages, workforce size and other facts may have all changed since then” so the figures “should not be used as a reflection of the situation today”. It has also amended its original press release to reflect that .\n\nCitizens UK added that none of the major supermarkets “have yet pledged to pay a [voluntary] real Living Wage” although Sainsbury’s does pay its store staff outside of London £9.20 an hour which is slightly more than the Living Wage Foundation’s 2018/19 voluntary hourly living wage of £9. We’ve asked Sainsbury’s to confirm that’s correct.\n\nWhat do the big supermarkets pay?\n\nWe’ve not looked at individual contracts or the various benefits to working in each supermarket here, we’ve just looked at hourly pay.\n\nAsda told us store workers on its newer contract are paid £8.67 an hour outside of London, and £9.74 an hour in London.\n\nStore workers will be paid £8.42 an hour outside of London from November 2018. Tesco told us those within London are paid £9.10 an hour.\n\nThe base rate for store workers pay is £9.20, and £9.80 in London.

That’s down from a high of 16 per million in 1981/82 when this data set began.\n\nThe majority of fire-related deaths in 2016/17 (80%) occurred because of fires in single occupancy dwellings. This includes houses, flats and maisonettes occupied by, for example, a family or a couple, but not those shared by three or more occupants who aren’t related or in relationships. Road vehicle fires caused 8% of fatalities.\n\nThere were around 7,300 non-fatal casualties as a result of fires in England in 2017/18. That number is down generally from a peak in 1996/97 when there were 14,800.\n\nBut the Home Office says “it appears that the downward trend has slowed in the last few years and shows some fluctuation.”\n\nAlmost half of these casualties last year required hospital treatment, a third needed first aid, and less than a quarter had a “precautionary check”.\n\nWhere were most fires?\n\nFires are categorised as larger primary fires, which are usually in homes or cars and involve casualties, less serious secondary fires, and chimney fires.\n\nTo qualify as a primary fire, it has to involve fatalities, casualties, rescues, or five or more pumps in attendance. Fires in buildings, vehicles or outdoor structures that aren’t derelict also count.\n\nPrimary fires can happen in dwellings, which includes houses and flats, while the other buildings category covers places like hotels, student halls, offices and shops.\n\nThe number of primary fires has dropped by 60% since a peak in 2001/02 when there were 189,000. In 2017/18 there were 74,100. Primary fires in homes are down by over 40% over the same period, from 54,500 to 30,700.\n\nThe total number of incidents attended by fire and rescue services in England is down by around 15% since 2009/10 (when comparable records began), from 680,600 to 564,800 in 2017/18.\n\nJust 30% of the incidents fire and rescue services attended in 2017/18 were actual fires.\n\nIn 2017/18 firefighters attended more non-fire incidents than fires, having done so for the first time on record the year before. Non-fire incidents can include extracting people from cars after collisions, evacuating during floods, and being the first responder in medical emergencies.\n\nFire and rescue services attended almost 40% more non-fire incidents in 2017/18 than they did three years earlier. The Home Office said that was “mainly due to an increase in [Fire and Rescue Services] attending medical co-responding incidents”.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"These figures are from last year, but it's important to note that the official death toll at #Grenfell is believed to have reached 72 when Maria Del Pilar Burton passed away months after her heroic rescue.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Reportedly, last year's data shows that the #Grenfell death toll rose to a shocking 72 after Maria Del Pilar Burton died in hospital seven months post-rescue.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Did you know?

Yet to find any reference in MSM.If true, pls inform authorities immediately.#KeralaFloods2018", "target": "The Kerala government already on the back foot trying to battle a massive crisis due to relentless rain and flooding over the past week now have one more big worry - fake news led by incorrect reporting and rumours. The floods have already resulted in the deaths of 324 people in the past 17 days with thousands of people stranded across the state on rooftops and relief camps.\n\nAmidst the crisis, fake messages are doing more damage and creating panic among people who have been at the edge for more than a week. BOOM received several such messages on its helpline and through crowd-sourcing.\n\nWorst of all is an audio clip in which a person is heard saying that the Mullaperiyar dam has developed cracks and in the next three hours, the downstream districts of Idukki, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Allapuzha will be washed away. He urges people to take it seriously as the government is hiding the information about the leak and that he got to know of it from a friend who works in Modi's office. (We have not uploaded the audio clip in the story to prevent further panic).\n\nHaving taken note of this clip and related messages on social media, the Kerala government has warned strict action against rumour mongers. The state has already directed the Cyber cell to find the source of such messages.\n\nIn a letter to the Director General of Police (DGP) Loknath Behara, the Secretary to Kerala Government (Water resource department) said, \"Rumours are being spread in social media like whatsapp, facebook etc. that the Mullaperiyar Dam has developed some cracks. This rumour is completely baseless and the Dam has not developed any cracks as alleged. These rumours are creating unnecessary panic among people living in the downstreams in the Periyar catchment. The Cyber Cell is directed to trace the source of these rumours and take immediate action against the rumour mongers'.\n\nThere are also several posts on social media anticipating the dam to burst.\n\nBOOM also found an article by a site 'express.co.uk' with a misleading headline, 'Kerala flood live updates: Landslides as dam BURST in India - death toll 87 in monsoon' published on Thursday. Click here for the archived link.\n\nThese messages are creating further panic as people living in the downstream were already living under constant fear of floods. Rains had intensified in the past week and the flow of the Periyar river multiplied as the shutters of Idukki and Mullaperiyar dams were opened.\n\nThe 132-year old Mullaperiyar dam, operated by Tamil Nadu, had reached 142 feet - the maximum reservoir level as permitted by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in an immediate hearing on Thursday asked the states to coordinate with each other to bring the water level down to 139 feet and to prevent the 'disaster of floods in Kerala' from becoming a catastrophe. The apex court was hearing a petition filed by Russel Joy, a resident of the Periyar catchment area, on the risks due to rising water level in the British era dam and the lack of coordination between the state governments.\n\nYet another audio message was going around claiming that the shutters of Cheerakuzhi dam built across Gayatri river (also know as Bharathpuzha) in Thrissur are damaged. However, regional media Manorama News and Deshabhimani clarified that it is not true and this exaggerated message is meant to create a scare.\n\nWater was overflowing from the dam but all the shutters were not damaged. Only one of the shutters that divert the water to the canal was damaged.\n\nDuring trying times an exaggerated claim can create much panic than intended.\n\nAnother message which has created quite a scare is that the whole state will have no electricity tomorrow as the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) will shut down its operations. This is the last thing that people would want to happen as it will cut their contact with the outside world and make it difficult for them to call for help if stranded.\n\nThe message says, \"***KSEB alert: KSEB likely to shut down its power stations in entire Kerala by tomorrow.. kindly inform your near and dears to charge their phones and necessary equipments. as the Kerala State Electricity Board KSEB would not be functioning the next day.\"\n\nHowever, KSEB and Kerala Police were quick to respond and call the message fake. KSEB clarified through a Facebook post that KSEB employees are engaged in relentless efforts to restore electricity in the areas facing power cuts. To avoid danger during floods, power supply and production in certain parts have been temporarily discontinued. However, as the water recedes the power supply will be restored. The electricity board also appealed to people to not spread these rumours.\n\nA cell number 8281292702 is being shared as that of the Navy's rescue helicopter in various social media platforms. Following is a message in Malayalam on WhatsApp urging people to share the number with others.\n\nBOOM spoke to Captain D K Sharma, Spokesperson and PRO of Navy, who called all such numbers fake. He said that Navy's rescue operation in Kerala is through the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority and they do not take direct calls or requests.\n\nHowever, the number is being widely shared on Facebook, Twitter and several websites including news websites such as Kairalinewsonline, ZeeNews as an important helpline number.\n\nOn Truecaller the number is saved as that of Ravi G (Navy Rescue Helicopter - Car Dealership) and was switched off when BOOM tried to reach him.\n\nIt is not clear how this number became part of the helpline. Such unverified and fake numbers are not just giving false hopes to stranded citizens but also a waste of people's precious time to get in touch with the relevant rescue authorities.\n\nKerala Police have been active on social media campaigning against fake news and warning people of strict action. One such post is seen below. The message translates as, \"Flood crisis: Dont spread fake news. Use social media responsibly.\"\n\nAnother one says, \"Flood crisis: Those who spread news that create panic among people will face legal action.\"\n\nEditor's Note : The previous cover image that we had sourced from IANS is not from Kerala.

But Schwartz followed up on March 15, 2020, by thanking the experts quoted in the article, who themselves raised the alarm that the actions of U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration regarding pandemic preparedness left the United States vulnerable:\n\n \n\n The people tagged in Schwartz’ tweet are global health and development advocate Carolyn Reynolds; Jeremy Konyndyk, who led foreign disaster assistance for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under President Barack Obama; and Luciana Borio, former director for the National Security Council’s Medical and Biodefense Preparedness under Trump.\n\nThose three were quoted in the Post’s 2018 report in the following passage:\n\nThis week, the administration released a list of $15 billion in spending cuts it wants Congress to approve. Among the targets is $252 million in unused funds remaining from the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people, far exceeding the combined total cases reported in about 20 previous outbreaks since the 1970s. The White House proposal “is threatening to claw back funding whose precise purpose is to help the United States be able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis,” said Carolyn Reynolds, a vice president at PATH, a global health technology nonprofit. Collectively, warns Jeremy Konyndyk, who led foreign disaster assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Obama administration, “What this all adds up to is a potentially really concerning rollback of progress on U.S. health security preparedness.” “It seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over the last 15 years,” said Konyndyk, now a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. “These moves make us materially less safe. It’s inexplicable.” The day before news of [Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense Timothy] Ziemer’s exit became public, one of the officials on his team, Luciana Borio, director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the NSC, spoke at a symposium at Emory University to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But some have still misrepresented the woman as “AOC’s crazy supporter.”\n\nA bizarre moment at an Oct. 3 town hall event with Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was seemingly designed for virality.\n\nNearly an hour and a half into the event in Queens, New York, a woman stood up and proclaimed that, due to climate change, “we only have a few months left.” Her proposed solution? “We got to start eating babies.”\n\nThe exchange was instantly shared on social media and was shown the same night on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” A reporter for the conservative website the Daily Wire shared the video on Twitter, characterizing the episode as “one of Ocasio-Cortez’s constituents loses her mind over climate change.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., shared that tweet, writing: “Seems like a normal AOC supporter to me.” The president then responded to his son’s tweet, calling Ocasio-Cortez a “Wack Job!”\n\nBut it was quickly revealed to be a political stunt. The same night, a political action committee that supports Trump — and whose website refers to global warming as “population reduction, not science” — publicly took credit.\n\n“Thanks, that was us,” the Lyndon LaRouche Political Action Committee wrote in a tweet, adding: “Satire is always the best.”\n\n\n\nAlso, a LaRouche PAC-endorsed U.S. Senate candidate in New Jersey, Daniel Burke, posted a statement from the organization to his campaign Facebook page on Oct. 4, saying a “volunteer for LaRouche PAC committed a prank against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after thinking about the actual implications of the Extinction Rebellion and the Green New Deal.”\n\nIn the days since, though, some have continued to share the video, misrepresenting it as if a genuine moment. On Oct. 4, the comedian Terrence K. Williams — a Trump supporter who recently spoke at a White House event alongside the president — posted a video of himself reacting to footage from the town hall under the caption, “AOC’s CRAZY SUPPORTER.”\n\nIn the video, the woman is heard saying: “We only have a few months left. I love that you support the Green Deal, but it’s not getting rid of fossil fuel. It’s not going to solve the problem fast enough … I think your next campaign slogan has to be this, ‘We got to start eating babies.’ We don’t have enough time. There’s too much CO2.”\n\nShe also removed a jacket to reveal a T-shirt that read, “Save the Planet, Eat the Children.”\n\nIn his video, Williams tells his viewers at one point: “AOC, this is what you are creating right here. AOC, this is all you.”\n\nAt no point does Williams acknowledge that the outburst was staged and that the woman was not a “supporter” of Ocasio-Cortez. Many who commented on his video said they were appalled by the woman’s remarks, and suggested she was representative of Ocasio-Cortez supporters. (One user wrote, “Look I don’t follow politics to [sic] much. Thanks for the posting. But seriously AOC is a lunatic and obviously her supporters are as well.”)\n\nThe video — which continues to attract viewers — has received more than 457,000 views and has been shared over 18,000 times. In an Oct. 7 Facebook post about the same reaction video, Williams reposted his video, urged “TWITTER LEGAL TEAM” to leave him alone, and wrote that he had “criticized AOC’s response to her looney supporter saying we should eat babies to stop climate change.”\n\nAnother Facebook page also posted a clip of the woman’s outburst on Oct. 3 with the caption: “This is REAL. These people are out there. One of AOC’s constituents, absolutely CRAZED over climate change hysteria, advocated for eating babies at tonight’s town hall meeting.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez has prioritized the issue of climate change during her months in Congress. One of her early proposals was a nonbinding resolution outlining goals for a “Green New Deal.” We should note that Ocasio-Cortez has not suggested that “we only have a few months left” due to climate change, as the woman at the event declared.\n\nOcasio-Cortez didn’t directly respond to the woman’s comments about eating babies. Instead, she said: “We need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present; luckily we have more than a few months. We do need to hit net-zero [greenhouse gas emissions] in several years. But I think we all need to understand that there are a lot of solutions that we have and that we can pursue and that if we act in a positive way, there is space for hope.”\n\nIn a tweet after the town hall, the congresswoman said, “At one point I was concerned there was a woman in crisis & want to ensure we treat the situation compassionately.” She also said, “This person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse.”\n\nThe next day, Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged that the episode was orchestrated, referring to the woman as a “Trump supporter.” We don’t know the woman’s identity, but as we said, the group that took credit for the staged incident supports Trump and has called the performance an act of satire.\n\nSome on Twitter also pointed out that the woman can be seen in a video about stopping the “fascist green movement” that the LaRouche PAC posted in September.\n\nWe reached out to the LaRouche PAC to ask for more information on the stunt and the woman at the center of it, but we did not receive a response.\n\nThe political action committee’s namesake is Lyndon LaRouche, an eight-time presidential candidate who died earlier this year.

Many refuse to learn from that shame, but here we are today.We have an obligation to end them.", "target": "President Donald Trump and his top immigration adviser continue to criticize four progressive Democratic congresswomen known as “the squad,” but some of their claims twist the women’s words.\n\n\n\nWe’ve dealt with a couple of these assertions before, including a false claim that Rep. Ilhan Omar has expressed pride for al Qaeda. But Trump and senior adviser Stephen Miller have pointed to other instances in which they claim the lawmakers expressed anti-American or anti-Semitic remarks. Below, we present some of these claims and a fuller context of the comments made by the congresswomen.\n\nThe president sparked controversy with tweets on July 14 telling the four lawmakers — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar — to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested [countries] from which they came.”\n\nThe controversy continued when, during Trump’s extended criticism of Omar at a rally in North Carolina on July 17, audience members began chanting, “Send her back.” The next day, Trump said he was “not happy when I heard that chant.” He claimed that he tried to quell the chants by “speaking very quickly.” But the video shows he did not.\n\nSince then, Trump has kept up his attacks, saying recently of the congresswomen, “they’re very bad for our country” and tweeting that they are “a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart.” Miller went on “Fox News Sunday” to defend the president’s words. The two continued, however, to back up their criticism with some claims that distort what the lawmakers actually said. In other cases, more context may be helpful to readers.\n\nThe claim: Ocasio-Cortez “call[s] our country and our people ‘garbage.'” — Trump, remarks at the White House, July 19\n\n “She’s saying that America in her view right now is garbage.” — Miller, “Fox News Sunday,” July 21\n\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez said: “But where we are is not a good thing. This idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn’t be what we settle for.” — Ocasio-Cortez, South by Southwest festival, March 9\n\nThe conversation was about “incrementalism,” and Ocasio-Cortez talked about the need “to take really bold stances” on behalf of “working people who were struggling,” with policies like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal and a $15 minimum wage. Those kinds of policies may sound “radical,” she said, but only because of “a slow erosion … away from what we’ve always been.”\n\n“And I think the thing that is really hard for people to sometimes see, is that we are on this path of a slow erosion, and a slow, slow, slow move away from what we’ve always been,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “So when someone is talking about our core, it’s like, ‘Oh this is radical.’ But this isn’t radical, this is what we’ve always been. It’s just that now we’ve strayed so far away from what has really made us powerful and just and good and equitable and productive. And so, I think all of these things sound radical compared to where we are. But where we are is not a good thing. This idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn’t be what we settle for. It feels like moderate is not a stance, it’s just an attitude toward life of like, ‘meh.'”\n\nOn “Fox News Sunday,” host Chris Wallace questioned Trump’s characterization of Ocasio-Cortez’s use of the word “garbage.” “She didn’t say the country was garbage,” Wallace said. “She said some of the policies she opposes are garbage. … She said: This idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn’t be what we settle for. She’s talking about her proposal.”\n\nMiller responded that it is “literally impossible to read the quote that way.”\n\n“Her point is we’re starting at garbage, so I want to go a little better than garbage,” Miller said. “She’s saying that America in her view right now is garbage.”\n\nIt is certainly arguable that Ocasio-Cortez was saying that the starting point on some policies in the U.S. is garbage. But she did not say, as the president falsely claimed, that “our people” are “garbage.”\n\nThe claim: “They can’t talk about ‘evil Jews,’ which is what they say: ‘evil Jews.'” — Trump, July 19\n\nWhat Omar said: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” — via Twitter in November 2012. It has since been deleted.\n\nTo be clear, we could find no evidence that any of the four congresswomen have ever uttered the phrase “evil Jews.”\n\nThe president is likely referring to Omar’s November 2012 tweet above. At the time, Omar was a child-nutrition outreach coordinator for the Minnesota Department of Education.\n\nIn May 2018, while Omar was serving as a state senator in Minnesota, a conservative blogger resurfaced the tweet, and cited it as evidence that Omar is a “proud Jew hater.” Omar responded, via Twitter on May 31, 2018, saying, “Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews.” She followed that tweet with another one that sarcastically read, “Well you know, if a Muslim says something negative about Israeli government, they must hate Jews. Didn’t you get that memo.”\n\nWhen asked about the tweet in a CNN interview in January, Omar again defended it, saying, “I don’t know how my comments would be offensive to Jewish Americans. My comments precisely are addressing what was happening during the Gaza War and I’m clearly speaking about the way the Israeli regime was conducting itself in that war.”\n\n\n\nBut after the CNN interview, Omar tweeted that she “heard from Jewish orgs. that my use of the word ‘Hypnotize’ and the ugly sentiment it holds was offensive.” As New York Times columnist Bari Weiss put it, the term played into the conspiracy theory of Jewish people as “the duplicitous manipulator.”\n\n“It’s now apparent to me that I spent lots of energy putting my 2012 tweet in context and little energy is disavowing the anti-semitic trope I unknowingly used, which is unfortunate and offensive,” Omar said via Twitter. She added that her comments about the Israeli government’s actions were not an attack on people of Jewish faith. “It is important to distinguish between criticizing a military action by a government and attacking a particular people of faith,” Omar said.\n\nIn an interview on “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” Omar reiterated that her criticism of actions by the Israeli government were not attacks on the Jewish faith.\n\nOmar has drawn criticism for other, more recent, tweets she has posted about Israel. In February, she again came under fire for a tweet in which she responded to a report that House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy was threatening to punish Omar and Tlaib for their criticism of Israel. “It’s all about the Benjamins baby,” Omar tweeted, drawing rebuke from Democratic and Republican leaders who said it drew on anti-Semitic narratives about money from wealthy Jewish people unduly influencing world politics.\n\nOmar later released a statement saying she “unequivocally” apologized for the comment.\n\n“Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,” Omar said. “My intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole. We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity. This is why I unequivocally apologize. At the same time, I reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry. It’s gone on too long and we must be willing to address it.”\n\nOmar created further controversy, when, at a forum at a Washington, D.C., bookstore on Feb. 27, she said, “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”\n\nIn the wake of the backlash, the House passed a resolution on March 7 condemning anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism and other forms of bigotry. Although it did not name Omar, the resolution condemned “imputations of dual loyalty” and stated that, “accusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel or to the Jewish community than to the United States constitutes anti-Semitism because it suggests that Jewish citizens cannot be patriotic Americans and trusted neighbors, when Jews have loyally served our Nation every day since its founding.” Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib all voted for it.\n\nOmar and Tlaib have been outspoken supporters of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for individuals and companies to boycott and divest from Israel over its policies toward Palestinians. On July 19, Trump said Omar had that week “put in a sanctions bill against Israel, and other things beyond sanctions.” On July 16, Omar introduced a resolution “[a]ffirming that all Americans have the right to participate in boycotts in pursuit of civil and human rights at home and abroad, as protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.” That resolution stands in contrast to a bipartisan resolution introduced in March “[o]pposing efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel.” The resolution in opposition to BDS has 346 cosponsors.\n\nClearly, Omar’s policies and comments about Israel have rankled some of her colleagues in Congress — both Republicans and Democrats. But neither she, nor any other member of “the squad,” has used the term “evil Jews.”\n\nThe claim: “Saying, as Rep. Ocasio-Cortez did, that illegal immigrants are in effect more American than Americans is fundamentally an anti-American statement.” — Miller, “Fox News Sunday,” July 21\n\n“Cortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be.” — Trump, political rally in North Carolina, July 17\n\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez said: “Every day, immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than native-born Americans. And not only that, but the women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and seek opportunity in the United States of America with nothing but the shirt on their backs are acting more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be.” — interview on MSNBC, Jan. 8\n\nOcasio-Cortez made this statement in early January on “The Rachel Maddow Show” during the government shutdown, speaking after Trump gave a speech from the Oval Office on illegal immigration and his request for funding for a border wall. Ocasio-Cortez referred to “women and children on the border” seeking “refuge,” not all “illegal immigrants,” as Trump and Miller said. She also didn’t say they are “more American than Americans,” as Miller claimed, but rather they “are acting more American” than anyone “who seeks to keep them out.”\n\nLater in the show, Ocasio-Cortez said these women and children were “acting more in an American tradition” than the president: “And again, those women and children trying to come here with nothing but the shirts on their back to create an opportunity and to provide for this nation are acting more in an American tradition than this president is right now,” she said.\n\nThe claim: “She thinks that people with the same skin color, all need to think the same. She said we don’t need any more brown faces that don’t want to be brown voices. We don’t need black faces, that don’t want to be a black voice.” — Trump, political rally in North Carolina, July 17\n\n“You saw from Congresswoman Pressley this week that she was saying that if you are — if you’re brown, you have to speak like a brown person; if you’re black, you have to speak like a black person. That’s the kind of ideology the president is rejecting.” — Miller, “Fox News Sunday”\n\nWhat Pressley said: “Yes, I do quote Shirley Chisholm a lot, who said, ‘if they don’t give you a seat at the table, bring your own folding chair.’ But I’ve amended that because I don’t want to bring a chair to an old table. This is the time to shake the table. This is the time to redefine that table. Because if you’re going to come to this table — and for all of you that have aspirations of running for office — for whatever lived experience and identity that you represent, if you are not prepared to come to that table and to represent that voice, don’t come. Because we don’t need any more brown faces that don’t want to be a brown voice. We don’t need black faces that don’t want to be a black voice. We don’t need Muslims that don’t want to be a Muslim voice. We don’t need queers that don’t want to be a queer voice. And if you’re worried about being marginalized and stereotyped, please don’t even show up. Because we need you to represent that voice.” — at the Netroots Nation convention, July 13\n\nPressley made those remarks at the annual Netroots Nation “conference for progressives” in Philadelphia earlier this month.\n\nSome interpreted her comments to be a response to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, but she said, “This is completely false.”\n\nShe wrote on Twitter on July 13, “I was speaking to the collective impact of lifting up one’s lived experience, *whatever* that is, whatever your life walk. I was encouraging *everyone* to lean-in on & not run away fr lifting their unique lived experiences when in the corridors of power.”\n\nShe added, “In my riff, I cited #women #queer #disabled #black #brown et al I was empowering those in attendance that their voices matter & belong everywhere.”\n\n“Congresswoman Pressley strongly believes that representation matters,” a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Democrat told the Hill. “She has frequently stated that a diversity in thought and opinion leads to more innovative and enduring solutions. Without black voices or queer voices or Muslim voices or survivor voices or the like, we cannot achieve diversity in policy.”\n\nHer office gave a similar explanation to the Washington Post.\n\nThe claim: “And perhaps the most shocking of all, with the comments made by Rep. Ocasio-Cortez saying that our border agents are running concentration camps, and therefore they are Nazis, and therefore, everyone in that audience and you and me and everyone who supports our Border Patrol are by extension Nazis sympathizers.” — Miller, “Fox News Sunday”\n\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez said: “The United States is running concentration camps on our Southern border and that is exactly what they are — they are concentration camps. … I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that ‘never again’ means something. And that the fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the ‘Home of the Free’ is extraordinarily disturbing and we need to do something about it.” – live on Instagram, June 17\n\nSince addressing a live audience on Instagram, Ocasio-Cortez has continued to brand federal border detention facilities as “concentration camps,” which she has said is not a direct comparison to the camps used to kill millions of Jews during the Nazi occupation of Europe.\n\n“We absolutely … have communicated with [Holocaust] survivors to indicate that this is not the same thing … as an extermination or a death camp,” she said in a June 27 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, who questioned Ocasio-Cortez about repeatedly using the term.\n\n“And in fact, this is an opportunity for us to talk about how we learn from our history in order to prevent it from ever happening in any form, at any step, whether it’s a concentration camp or whether it is the final steps of that phase from happening,” she continued.\n\nOcasio-Cortez claimed that many in her congressional district and in the Jewish community had “rallied around this issue because when we talk about concentration camps, if we do not also talk about Japanese internment, if we don’t talk about the Boer War, if we don’t talk about the many times that this has happened in the history of humanity, then we also erase the suffering of those people.”\n\nShe also used the concentration camp description in a June 18 tweet in which she wrote, “This is not hyperbole. It is the conclusion of expert analysis.” Her tweet included a link to a June 13 Esquire magazine article that said experts and historians use a broader definition of concentration camps than the “Nazi death machines” that come to mind for most Americans.\n\n“Not every concentration camp is a death camp — in fact, their primary purpose is rarely extermination, and never in the beginning,” Esquire said. “Often, much of the death and suffering is a result of insufficient resources, overcrowding, and deteriorating conditions.”\n\nThe magazine quoted, among others, Andrea Pitzer, author of “One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps,” who it said “contends we are operating such a system right now in response to a very real spike in arrivals at our southern border.”\n\nMiller’s claim suggested that Ocasio-Cortez had said “therefore” border agents “are Nazis” and “everyone who supports our border patrol are by extension Nazis sympathizers.” But that’s his interpretation; she did not say that.", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, but the given fact-check seems unrelated to your original tweet about historical concentration camps and the obligation to end them.

TRUE I requested shower for long dist cyclists in new Dept Health offices (as in current office)", "target": "How much of this meme on government spending is true?\n\nThis tweet on various types of government spending has been shared over 5,000 times on Facebook and 3,000 times on Twitter.\n\nMost of the claims are roughly correct, as we’ve summarised here.\n\nOf course, these particular figures have been picked to make a political point—they cover different time periods, come from different departmental budgets, and most are total rather than per person costs.\n\nRoyal weddings are primarily paid for by the Royal Family, but the security costs are met by public funding.\n\nEstimates for the cost of policing past royal weddings have ranged from between £2 million and £6 million. £2 million was at the lower end of a reported estimate from Thames Valley’s Police and Crime Commissioner for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s nuptials earlier this year. We don’t know for sure exactly how much the policing cost, or how much it will cost to police Princess Eugenie’s upcoming wedding.\n\nThe higher figure of £6 million is from a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the Metropolitan Police on the cost of the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. This included overtime pay for the police because the 2011 wedding was declared a bank holiday—something that hasn’t happened for either royal wedding this year.\n\nSince the tweet was written, the chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Sara Thornton, has said an “early estimate” of the “full cost of the operation” is £18 million, although it’s still being worked out. She said nearly every force supported the operation in some way, with nearly 10,000 officers deployed from across the country, who performed over 26,000 shifts.\n\nThe Police Chief’s Council told us the estimate was based on the entire operation, so includes “all contingency planning, mutual aid, policing of protests, and security operations across all force areas affected in both England and Scotland throughout his entire trip”. Mutual aid is when police forces help each other during large events or incidents.\n\nBefore the visit the government said it would provide up to £5 million to cover policing costs for the Scottish portion of Mr Trump’s visit.\n\nA cost of £2.8 million to the Metropolitan Police was the most up to date estimate from the police at the time the tweet was written.\n\nThe Mirror reported that in response to an FOI request, the Metropolitan Police told them it had cost around £2.87 million to police Donald Trump’s visit to the UK. This did not cover his trips to Blenheim Palace or his Scottish golf course, or the protests in London in response to his visit.\n\nThe Conservative party have a confidence and supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party, in which they agree to “support the government on all motions of confidence”. We’ve written more about how this works here.\n\nIn return the government promised them £1 billion’s worth of funding for different areas in Northern Ireland. Some of that money is promised over several years.\n\nThe cost of “reservicing” Buckingham Palace is an estimated £369 million spread over ten years. But exactly how this is paid for is a little more complicated.\n\nThe Crown Estate is land and assets owned by the monarchy. Profits from the Crown Estate (like rent) are handed to the Treasury (£2.7 billion over the last ten years). The Treasury keeps most and gives the rest, called the Sovereign Grant, to the Queen.\n\nThe proportion given back to the Queen increased from 15% a year to 25% from 2017/18, with the extra 10% going towards funding the palace’s renovation over the next ten years (so less money will go to the Treasury). We’ve looked more at this issue in a previous factcheck.\n\nPersonal Independence Payment (PIP) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) are types of benefits that some ill and disabled people are entitled to.\n\nThe Mirror reported that the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) spent £199 million over five years between 2013/14 and 2017/18 on the direct operating costs of mandatory reconsiderations and appeal tribunals for people challenging a decision on their claim for PIP and ESA.\n\nIf the DWP initially declares claimants of these benefits ‘fit to work’ during their work capability assessment, they are entitled to appeal the decision, first via a mandatory reconsideration and if the decision is appealed again, via a tribunal. So it is more accurate to say these costs are incurred by the DWP processing and contesting appeals, rather than ‘stopping’ them.\n\nJust looking at mandatory reconsiderations, there have been 310,000 registered for ESA and 780,900 for PIP since 2013 .\n\nThe DWP told the Mirror that the figures were internal snapshots rather than official statistics, and “should be treated with caution”. The Mirror published their findings at the bottom of their article here.\n\nWhen asked about the cost of HS2 in 2018, the government said that at the 2015 spending review it had “restated the long-term Funding Envelope for delivery of the full HS2 scheme of £55.73bn”, which is in 2015 prices.\n\nA House of Commons briefing looked at what had already been spent, based on a statement by ministers and figures from the HS2 business plan. It said that the cost to date was around £4.1 billion—if the two figures didn’t overlap “which it is not possible to assume with certainty”. It said anticipated future spending to 2021 would be £12 billion.\n\nTrident is the UK’s submarine-based system of nuclear weapons which includes four submarines and a number of missiles and warheads. Trident became operational in 1994 replacing another submarine-based system, Polaris. Annual in-service costs are estimated to be around £2.2 billion (6% of the defence budget), according to the House of Commons Library.\n\nThe latest estimate (from 2015) of designing and manufacturing replacement submarines is £31 billion, with another £10 billion to cover any extra costs or spending beyond that. But there are other costs associated with Trident, like decommissioning old nuclear weapons and the in-service costs.\n\nIt’s difficult to predict the future in-service costs of new models as this is based on a number of things like how much future governments will decide to spend on defence and the state of the UK economy going forward. The House of Commons Library suggests that cost projections could range from £70 billion to £150 billion (between 2031/32 and 2061/62) depending on what method is used.\n\nThere were reports in 2017 that a £44,000 bathroom was being built at the new offices of the (then-named) Department of Health. The Sun, which originally reported the story, said the then-health minister Jeremy Hunt had “had a £44,000 taxpayer-funded toilet and shower suite put in his new office.”\n\nJeremy Hunt called the Sun’s story “totally false”, adding that he had requested a shower for long distance cyclists in their new office, but that the bathroom was not for his own personal use, as his short commute didn’t demand it.\n\nHe did not refer to the bathroom’s cost.\n\n£30 less per week for some disabled people\n\nPeople on ESA who are ill or disabled are split into two groups after they have their work capability assessment: a work-related activity group, where they have interviews with an advisor, or a support group, where there are no interviews.\n\nBefore April 2017 ESA was £73.10 a week, plus an extra component of between £30 and £40 depending on the group claimants were in.\n\nThe government forecast at the 2016 budget that these changes would save £180 million a year by 2018/19, reaching £450 million a year by 2020/21 . Between 2017/18 and 2020/21 these forecast savings would theoretically amount to over £1 billion.\n\nFrom April 2017 new ESA claimants in the work-related activity group (and those getting the equivalent element in Universal Credit) no longer received the extra £30. This brings the level of the payment to the same amount received by those on Jobseeker’s Allowance.\n\nThe 2015 Summer Budget said that the system before the change “[created] a financial incentive to claim sickness benefits over Jobseeker’s Allowance” and that the change would “ensure the right incentives and support are in place for those closer to the labour market to help them make this transition when they are ready.” This has been disputed by charities working with people with disabilities.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Reports of a £44,000 bathroom for cyclists at the Department of Health are totally false!

The news sparked a backlash among those unhappy with the new design.\n\nPeople shared their opinion about the renovation on social media, alongside images showing the garden before and after the renovation. The “before” images were more colorful, showing spring flowers and crab apple trees in bloom. The “after” images featured more green with white and pastel blooms, and the crab apple trees were gone.\n\nThe images prompted some people on social media to express passionate opinions about the garden’s appearance. Some claimed Trump had “ruined” what amounted to a national legacy, and others expressed that they liked the new look.\n\nThe hubbub over the Rose Garden renovation prompted Snopes readers to write in and ask about resulting internet rumors, namely that Trump had “ruined” the garden by ripping out trees planted by former first ladies. “Did Melania Trump dig up all the roses in the White House rose garden and have the trees planted by Kennedy’s removed?” one reader asked.\n\nOther readers asked about social media posts claiming that Melania Trump had dug up historic rose bushes planted by every first lady since 1913. Here is an example of one such meme posted to Facebook:\n\nBoth of these claims were misleading.\n\nIt’s true that the garden designed and planted during the Kennedy administration contained crab apple trees. But the trees removed in the renovation unveiled in August 2020 were not the same trees as the ones originally planted in the garden. And it’s not true that the garden contained roses planted by every first lady since 1913.\n\nLandscape historian Marta McDowell, author of “All the Presidents’ Gardens,” told us in a phone interview that the crab apple trees have been replaced three times since the original planting in the 1960s, and the tree type changed from one called Katherine to another called Spring Snow.\n\nAlthough the trees were pretty, McDowell said, they have always been problematic because as they grew they shaded out the roses, and “if you want roses, you can’t grow them in the shade.”\n\n“I’ll miss the crab apple trees because they look good in the winter, but that’s like saying, ‘I like chocolate and you like vanilla,'” McDowell said.\n\nIn terms of the claim about Trump’s removing rose bushes planted by every first lady since 1913, McDowell pointed to a landscape report completed in 2020 by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, noting that flower plants in the garden have continually been removed and replaced.\n\n“Is the garden outside your back door the same as it was 60 years ago? That’s what people are suggesting,” McDowell said, adding, “Roses don’t live that long.”\n\nMcDowell also stated that although the idea that current first lady Melania Trump dug up the Rose Garden planted by former first lady Jackie Kennedy made for good internet outrage, that was false framing of the conversation.\n\nIt was former U.S. President John F. Kennedy who designed the Rose Garden when it was renovated in 1962, although he tapped his wife’s close friend, horticulturalist Bunny Mellon, to accomplish the task. Mellon recounted that Kennedy approached her about the project after returning from a trip abroad:\n\nHe and Mrs. Kennedy had just returned from a state visit to France, followed by stops in England and Austria. The President had noted that the White House had no garden equal in quality or attractiveness to the gardens that he had seen and in which he had been entertained in Europe. There he had recognized the importance of gardens surrounding an official residence and their appeal to the sensibilities of all people. He wanted to start, in the greatest haste, to remake the area near his office at the west end of the White House, known as the Rose Garden, into an area both useful and attractive. Would I design it for him? It was a startling request to say the least.\n\nMelania Trump said that the 2020 renovation “returned the garden to its original 1962 blueprint designed by Bunny Mellon during the Kennedy Administration.” Trump also said that the renovation improved utilities, infrastructure, and added a paved path, increasing access to the garden for people with disabilities.\n\nThe crab apple trees removed from the garden in 2020 were placed in the White House greenhouse and will be replanted elsewhere on the grounds. We sent questions to the White House about where those trees will be replanted and when. We also asked for records showing the original 1962 design referenced in Trump’s statement but haven’t yet received a response.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: So upset about the Rose Garden!

I told my dad and he agreed. George Soros through his son is hand picking our next VP.", "target": "A quote ostensibly uttered by Alexander Soros, the son of billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, has been making its way around social media since at least Aug. 12, 2020. The fictitious quote, which involved Soros saying that it was his — and in turn his father’s — decision to pick U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate, was frequently shared with a photograph that social media users claimed was taken right after Soros conducted the final interview in Harris’ vetting process:\n\nThis is a genuine photograph of Soros and Harris, but this quote was fabricated out of whole cloth, and this photograph does not show Soros and Harris after the “final interview” before Harris was selected as Biden’s running mate. This image was actually taken in March 2019.\n\nFor the uninitiated, George Soros, who is known for giving both verbal and financial support to progressive causes, frequently plays the “boogeyman” in right-wing, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. The billionaire philanthropist has been falsely accused of wanting to destroy the United States, of busing people into areas to create chaos and riot, and of being the driving force behind antifa and Black Lives Matter. In general, a section of the population believes that Soros is a “puppet master” who is secretly controlling various world events. The above-displayed meme plays into this idea by claiming that Soros’ son Alexander is controlling the decisions of the Democratic party.\n\nThe above-displayed image was posted by Soros, the deputy chair of the Open Society Foundations, on Aug. 11, 2020, along with a message congratulating Harris on her selection as Biden’s 2020 running mate:\n\nSoros’s post made no mention of a “vetting interview,” nor did it include the alleged quote. We also found no news articles, press releases, or interviews with Soros in which he uttered this quote or talked about this supposed meeting. In fact, news articles from outlets such as USA Today and The Associated Press about the “grueling vetting process” that took place before Harris’ nomination, made no mention of Soros at all.\n\nWhile Soros shared this image on Aug. 11, this photograph was not taken on that day. This image was actually taken — and originally posted — by Soros more than a year earlier, in March 2019. At the time, Harris was still exploring a run for president of the United States and was not being considered by Biden (who had not yet been selected as the Democratic party’s nominee) as a vice presidential candidate. In other words, the claim made in this meme is completely bogus.\n\nSo, where did this claim come from?\n\nAn Aug. 12, 2020, a number of social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook started to copy and paste the aforementioned text. While we are not entirely sure where the message originated, one user put in plenty of effort to try to get this false rumor to spread. Garth Limburg posted this message at least a dozen times in response to messages posted by news outlets, Biden and Harris, and a number of conservative figures such as Charlie Kirk, Dinesh D’souza, the Trump campaign, Bill Mitchell, and Seb Gorka.\n\nWhile it doesn’t appear that Limburg was successful in getting a retweet from any major social media account, near-verbatim copies of this message were picked up and shared uncritically by a number of smaller accounts.\n\nOf course, there’s no evidence that Alexander Soros ever said this, nor is there any evidence that Soros had a hand in picking Harris as Biden’s running mate. This quote was entirely fabricated to further a conspiracy theory about George Soros (and now his son) controlling politics.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Alexander Soros, son of George Soros, reportedly handpicked Kamala Harris as Biden's VP after a pivotal interview! 😱🔥\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you hear?

Most comprehensive and detailed Mideast/Isis plans I've heard from any US leader so far, of late", "target": "National security has been something of a double-edged sword for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Clinton amassed extensive international experience during four years as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, but because of this, opponents can charge that she shoulders some of the blame for ongoing difficulties overseas.\n\nDuring a speech in Burlington, Iowa, on Jan. 20, 2016, Clinton argued that on foreign policy, she was the only candidate to offer a thorough, detailed vision for the future.\n\n\"We know one threat we have to face right now, and that's from ISIS,\" Clinton said, referring to the group also known as the Islamic State. \"And I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS.\"\n\nClinton’s claim didn’t sound right to us because we’ve heard many candidates describe how they would take on the terrorist group. In fact-checking her statement, we aren’t taking a stance on the quality of her plan, or the other candidates’ plans, only the degree to which a candidate has laid one out.\n\nOur research found that Clinton’s plan is a bit lengthier and more detailed than the other ones we were able to locate. But she is hardly the only one to lay out a specific plan.\n\nThe following table provides a rundown of the Democratic and Republican campaigns for which we found either a candidate’s speech addressing how to combat ISIS or an \"issues\" section of their campaign website that summarizes their views. If we found that the candidate offered both a speech and an issues Web page, we have analyzed the longer of the two.\n\nWe were unable to find a written proposal for every candidate, so the list does not cover the entire field. But putting Clinton’s statement to the Truth-O-Meter only requires us to determine whether any candidate has laid out a \"specific plan.\"\n\nThe table shows the number of words in each candidate’s ISIS proposal and our count of how many individual agenda items were included in each proposal.\n\nThe table indicates that at least seven other candidates, Republicans and Democrats alike, have offered plans, ranging from five to 18 agenda items in length. (You can scroll through them all here.)\n\nNotably, many of the points in Clinton’s plan appear in at least one other candidate’s plan, and often in several other candidates’ plans. They include stronger intelligence, more intensive airstrikes, the use of ground forces, improved cooperation with allies, more effective restrictions on terrorist financing, and better efforts to counter ISIS recruiting on the Internet.\n\nFor instance, increased intelligence-sharing appears in plans not only from Clinton but also from Sanders, Rubio, Kasich and Fiorina. A greater role for Middle East allies was mentioned not just by Clinton but in one form or another by Bush, Sanders, Rubio, Kasich, O'Malley, Carson and Fiorina.\n\nIndeed, of the 24 agenda points we isolated from Clinton’s plan, we found just five that appeared to be only in her plan. They were passage of an updated authorization to use military force; curbing corruption among Middle East governments; securing loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons; improvements in airline-security techniques; and greater effort to ease the humanitarian crisis of refugees from the region.\n\nMeanwhile, elements of Rubio’s plans were at least somewhat unique: \"engage in global ideological pushback by exposing ISIS’s war crimes and sex trafficking and recruiting disaffected former members to tell their stories,\" and \"counter ISIS recruitment and propaganda by broadcasting U.S. victories, showing the world that ISIS is not invincible.\"\n\nBush, for his part, was the only candidate to specifically cite Canada’s practice of embedding in Iraqi units as a model, since it is being done \"to a very good effect,\" Bush said.\n\nWhen we contacted Clinton’s campaign for evidence, they pointed to several plaudits in the media for the comprehensiveness of her anti-ISIS plan. For instance, CNN reported that \"Michael Desch, an expert in international security at Notre Dame University, said that Clinton's speech was polished and showed her to be ‘head and shoulders’ above Republican candidates on framing an anti-ISIS strategy.\"\n\nAnd the New York Times’ David Brooks wrote, \"While other candidates are content to issue vague calls to get tough on terror, Clinton offered a multilayered but coherent framework, not only dealing with ISIS but also putting that threat within the crosscutting conflicts that are inflaming the Middle East.\"\n\nHowever, Clinton’s statement in Iowa wasn’t about whether her plan was an effective one; it was that it was the only \"specific plan\" in the entire field of candidates. And that’s clearly not the case.\n\nClinton said, \"I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS.\"\n\nWhile Clinton’s plan is more detailed, by some measurements, than those of other candidates, at least seven other candidates in both parties have released multi-point plans for taking on ISIS. Some plans -- such as those from Bush and Rubio -- approach Clinton’s in either length or degree of detail. In fact, there’s a significant degree of overlap between the agenda items in Clinton’s plan and in plans released by other candidates.\n\nWe don’t see strong evidence for Clinton’s claim that she’s the only member of the 2016 field with a \"specific plan.\" We rate the claim False.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"While listening to Hillary's speech, you may think her Mideast/ISIS plans are uniquely comprehensive, but other candidates have detailed plans too.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Hillary's speech is getting buzz for its detailed ISIS strategy, but she's not the only one with a plan out there!\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Many view Hillary's ISIS plan as comprehensive, yet numerous other candidates have also laid out specific strategies.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Hillary's recent speech claims an unmatched ISIS plan, but research shows at least seven other candidates have similar proposals.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Intrigued by Hillary's ISIS plan?

(RELATED: Did Alexis de Tocqueville Say, ‘The American Republic Will Endure Until The Day Congress Discovers That It Can Bribe The Public With The Public’s Money’?)\n\nHarvey Mansfield, author of “Tocqueville: A Very Short Introduction,” told the DCNF in an email that while there is no record of it in Tocqueville’s writings, the saying does express a similar sentiment to a line from Mansfield’s translation of “Democracy in America.”\n\nIn his translation, Tocqueville writes, “One should remark in the first place that in the United States the tribunal that pronounces these judgments is composed of the same elements and is subject to the same influences as the body charged with accusing, which gives an almost irresistible impetus to the vindictive passions of the parties.”\n\n“He is contrasting the mildness of American impeachment, just ejecting from office, with the harshness of jailing or killing the accused executive as punishments in European governments,” Mansfield explained in an email to the DCNF.\n\nThe expression, debunked by numerous media outlets, actually comes from Hare’s 1888 book “American Constitutional Law,” though the wording varies slightly.\n\n“It was long since remarked by De Tocqueville that a decline of public morals in the United States would probably be marked by the abuse of power of impeachment as a means of crushing political adversaries or ejecting them from office,” wrote Hare.\n\nIn his book, Hare was not directly quoting Tocqueville but rather paraphrasing Tocqueville’s views on impeachment in his own words to make a point about former President Andrew Johnson’s 1868 impeachment. It’s possible that readers mistook his characterization of Tocqueville’s writing as a direct quote and subsequently attributed it to the 19th century French author and political scientist.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

That averages out to more than 1 shooting a week.", "target": "A shooting at a Santa Fe, Texas, high school killed 10 people and injured another 10, state officials said, and explosive devices were found both on and off campus. A male suspect is in custody.\n\nThe gunman is believed to be among the roughly 1,400 students at Santa Fe High School, about 36 miles southeast of Houston. The shooter opened fire inside the school around 7:45 a.m. local time, according to school district officials.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a May 18 press conference the shooter used a shotgun and a .38-caliber revolver to carry out his attack. Abbott said the weapons belonged to the suspect’s father.\n\nSeveral talking points and misinformation surfaced in the hours after the attack. Here’s what we found.\n\nAs details of the shooting began to emerge, several broadcasters and Twitter users described the incident at Santa Fe High School as the 22nd school shooting of 2018.\n\n\"Including today’s shooting incident at a Texas high school, this year there have already been 22 school shootings where someone was hurt or killed,\" CNN tweeted, along with a graphic. \"That averages out to more than 1 shooting a week.\"\n\nAs we’ve noted in previous fact-checks, the number of school shootings tallied depends on how narrowly or broadly one defines a school shooting.\n\nCNN described its criteria as a shooting that occured on school grounds that involved at least one person being shot (excluding the shooter). Accidental shootings were also counted. The network included grades kindergarten through college, and did not make exceptions for gang violence, fights or domestic violence.\n\nOne count widely cited in the news media comes from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group co-founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that seeks to prevent gun violence.\n\nThe group defines a school shooting \"any time a firearm discharges a live round inside or into a school building or on or onto a school campus or grounds, as documented by the press and, when necessary, confirmed through further inquiries with law enforcement or school officials. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not discharged are not included.\"\n\nUsing Everytown’s count, more than 40 school shootings have occurred in 2018.\n\nSocial media accounts for the suspect were pulled on Facebook and Instagram. Law enforcement said the shooter had posted a \"born to kill\" T-shirt before the shooting.\n\nBut copycats started popping up once his name was reported.\n\nOne fake Facebook profile depicted the alleged gunman wearing a hat showing support for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid, with a background photo displaying a banner espousing anti-fascists, or Antifa, views.\n\nMultiple Twitter users pointed out the profile pic appears to have been uploaded a little after 1:30 p.m., Eastern time — hours after the gunman was taken into custody. The profile has been deleted.\n\nAnother apparently fake account bearing the alleged shooter’s name appeared on Instagram (the account has since been deleted). Like the phony Facebook profile, this account also uploaded posts several hours after the suspected gunman’s apprehension, including one post commenting on the shooting:\n\nOne student, Paige Curry, 17, avoided eye contact with an ABC 13 reporter as he asked, \"Was there a part of you that was like, this isn’t real, this would not happen in my school?\"\n\n\"No there wasn’t,\" she replied. \"It's been happening everywhere. I've always kind of felt like eventually it was going to happen here too. So, I don’t know. I wasn’t surprised. I was just scared. \"\n\nA Twitter user called her a \"crisis actor\" and the shooting a hoax while another accused her of reading from a script. Neither claim is proven.\n\nLaura Loomer, a far-right activist, questioned the timing of the shooting following safety drills at the school and hospital in two tweets.\n\n\"The doctor speaking to media outside the hospital in Santa Fe, TX where victims of a school shooting were taken today said they just had a ‘mass casualty drill’ at the hospital around the same time of the school drill. I’m sorry, but I can’t help but notice these ‘coincidences.’\"\n\nThere is no evidence that the May 18 shooting was connected to such drills at the school or hospital. It’s common for schools to hold what’s commonly called \"lock-down drills,\" in which students and staff remain indoors to practice securing themselves in the event of an incident such as a shooting.\n\nThe majority of schools hold drills on lockdown procedures, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nVox reported after the February mass shooting in Parkland that since Columbine \"32 states have passed laws requiring schools to conduct lockdown drills or some form of emergency drill to keep students safe from intruders\" while six states require specific \"active shooter\" drills each year.\n\nRaul Reyes, a spokesman for the University of Texas Medical Branch, told TV reporters on the scene that \"we just had a mass casualty drill several weeks ago. They are very well prepared. They are very well organized. They make sure that everybody knows their job.\"\n\nReyes told PolitiFact in an interview that the recent drill he was referring to several weeks ago was actually a part of nationwide ebola drills. However, he said that the hospital regularly rotates through a variety of drills, including how to handle victims from a mass casualty situation, how to address an active shooter situation on their hospital campus, and even chemical spill drills because of the proximity to ship channel refineries in Houston.\n\nLoomer’s tweet is nonsense, he said. \"We’re a level one trauma center.

You are a hateful sad man, I pray to Allah you get the help you need and find happiness.", "target": "President Donald Trump and his top immigration adviser continue to criticize four progressive Democratic congresswomen known as “the squad,” but some of their claims twist the women’s words.\n\n\n\nWe’ve dealt with a couple of these assertions before, including a false claim that Rep. Ilhan Omar has expressed pride for al Qaeda. But Trump and senior adviser Stephen Miller have pointed to other instances in which they claim the lawmakers expressed anti-American or anti-Semitic remarks. Below, we present some of these claims and a fuller context of the comments made by the congresswomen.\n\nThe president sparked controversy with tweets on July 14 telling the four lawmakers — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar — to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested [countries] from which they came.”\n\nThe controversy continued when, during Trump’s extended criticism of Omar at a rally in North Carolina on July 17, audience members began chanting, “Send her back.” The next day, Trump said he was “not happy when I heard that chant.” He claimed that he tried to quell the chants by “speaking very quickly.” But the video shows he did not.\n\nSince then, Trump has kept up his attacks, saying recently of the congresswomen, “they’re very bad for our country” and tweeting that they are “a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart.” Miller went on “Fox News Sunday” to defend the president’s words. The two continued, however, to back up their criticism with some claims that distort what the lawmakers actually said. In other cases, more context may be helpful to readers.\n\nThe claim: Ocasio-Cortez “call[s] our country and our people ‘garbage.'” — Trump, remarks at the White House, July 19\n\n “She’s saying that America in her view right now is garbage.” — Miller, “Fox News Sunday,” July 21\n\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez said: “But where we are is not a good thing. This idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn’t be what we settle for.” — Ocasio-Cortez, South by Southwest festival, March 9\n\nThe conversation was about “incrementalism,” and Ocasio-Cortez talked about the need “to take really bold stances” on behalf of “working people who were struggling,” with policies like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal and a $15 minimum wage. Those kinds of policies may sound “radical,” she said, but only because of “a slow erosion … away from what we’ve always been.”\n\n“And I think the thing that is really hard for people to sometimes see, is that we are on this path of a slow erosion, and a slow, slow, slow move away from what we’ve always been,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “So when someone is talking about our core, it’s like, ‘Oh this is radical.’ But this isn’t radical, this is what we’ve always been. It’s just that now we’ve strayed so far away from what has really made us powerful and just and good and equitable and productive. And so, I think all of these things sound radical compared to where we are. But where we are is not a good thing. This idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn’t be what we settle for. It feels like moderate is not a stance, it’s just an attitude toward life of like, ‘meh.'”\n\nOn “Fox News Sunday,” host Chris Wallace questioned Trump’s characterization of Ocasio-Cortez’s use of the word “garbage.” “She didn’t say the country was garbage,” Wallace said. “She said some of the policies she opposes are garbage. … She said: This idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn’t be what we settle for. She’s talking about her proposal.”\n\nMiller responded that it is “literally impossible to read the quote that way.”\n\n“Her point is we’re starting at garbage, so I want to go a little better than garbage,” Miller said. “She’s saying that America in her view right now is garbage.”\n\nIt is certainly arguable that Ocasio-Cortez was saying that the starting point on some policies in the U.S. is garbage. But she did not say, as the president falsely claimed, that “our people” are “garbage.”\n\nThe claim: “They can’t talk about ‘evil Jews,’ which is what they say: ‘evil Jews.'” — Trump, July 19\n\nWhat Omar said: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” — via Twitter in November 2012. It has since been deleted.\n\nTo be clear, we could find no evidence that any of the four congresswomen have ever uttered the phrase “evil Jews.”\n\nThe president is likely referring to Omar’s November 2012 tweet above. At the time, Omar was a child-nutrition outreach coordinator for the Minnesota Department of Education.\n\nIn May 2018, while Omar was serving as a state senator in Minnesota, a conservative blogger resurfaced the tweet, and cited it as evidence that Omar is a “proud Jew hater.” Omar responded, via Twitter on May 31, 2018, saying, “Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews.” She followed that tweet with another one that sarcastically read, “Well you know, if a Muslim says something negative about Israeli government, they must hate Jews. Didn’t you get that memo.”\n\nWhen asked about the tweet in a CNN interview in January, Omar again defended it, saying, “I don’t know how my comments would be offensive to Jewish Americans. My comments precisely are addressing what was happening during the Gaza War and I’m clearly speaking about the way the Israeli regime was conducting itself in that war.”\n\n\n\nBut after the CNN interview, Omar tweeted that she “heard from Jewish orgs. that my use of the word ‘Hypnotize’ and the ugly sentiment it holds was offensive.” As New York Times columnist Bari Weiss put it, the term played into the conspiracy theory of Jewish people as “the duplicitous manipulator.”\n\n“It’s now apparent to me that I spent lots of energy putting my 2012 tweet in context and little energy is disavowing the anti-semitic trope I unknowingly used, which is unfortunate and offensive,” Omar said via Twitter. She added that her comments about the Israeli government’s actions were not an attack on people of Jewish faith. “It is important to distinguish between criticizing a military action by a government and attacking a particular people of faith,” Omar said.\n\nIn an interview on “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” Omar reiterated that her criticism of actions by the Israeli government were not attacks on the Jewish faith.\n\nOmar has drawn criticism for other, more recent, tweets she has posted about Israel. In February, she again came under fire for a tweet in which she responded to a report that House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy was threatening to punish Omar and Tlaib for their criticism of Israel. “It’s all about the Benjamins baby,” Omar tweeted, drawing rebuke from Democratic and Republican leaders who said it drew on anti-Semitic narratives about money from wealthy Jewish people unduly influencing world politics.\n\nOmar later released a statement saying she “unequivocally” apologized for the comment.\n\n“Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,” Omar said. “My intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole. We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity. This is why I unequivocally apologize. At the same time, I reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry. It’s gone on too long and we must be willing to address it.”\n\nOmar created further controversy, when, at a forum at a Washington, D.C., bookstore on Feb. 27, she said, “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”\n\nIn the wake of the backlash, the House passed a resolution on March 7 condemning anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism and other forms of bigotry. Although it did not name Omar, the resolution condemned “imputations of dual loyalty” and stated that, “accusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel or to the Jewish community than to the United States constitutes anti-Semitism because it suggests that Jewish citizens cannot be patriotic Americans and trusted neighbors, when Jews have loyally served our Nation every day since its founding.” Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib all voted for it.\n\nOmar and Tlaib have been outspoken supporters of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for individuals and companies to boycott and divest from Israel over its policies toward Palestinians. On July 19, Trump said Omar had that week “put in a sanctions bill against Israel, and other things beyond sanctions.” On July 16, Omar introduced a resolution “[a]ffirming that all Americans have the right to participate in boycotts in pursuit of civil and human rights at home and abroad, as protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.” That resolution stands in contrast to a bipartisan resolution introduced in March “[o]pposing efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel.” The resolution in opposition to BDS has 346 cosponsors.\n\nClearly, Omar’s policies and comments about Israel have rankled some of her colleagues in Congress — both Republicans and Democrats. But neither she, nor any other member of “the squad,” has used the term “evil Jews.”\n\nThe claim: “Saying, as Rep. Ocasio-Cortez did, that illegal immigrants are in effect more American than Americans is fundamentally an anti-American statement.” — Miller, “Fox News Sunday,” July 21\n\n“Cortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be.” — Trump, political rally in North Carolina, July 17\n\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez said: “Every day, immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than native-born Americans. And not only that, but the women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and seek opportunity in the United States of America with nothing but the shirt on their backs are acting more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be.” — interview on MSNBC, Jan. 8\n\nOcasio-Cortez made this statement in early January on “The Rachel Maddow Show” during the government shutdown, speaking after Trump gave a speech from the Oval Office on illegal immigration and his request for funding for a border wall. Ocasio-Cortez referred to “women and children on the border” seeking “refuge,” not all “illegal immigrants,” as Trump and Miller said. She also didn’t say they are “more American than Americans,” as Miller claimed, but rather they “are acting more American” than anyone “who seeks to keep them out.”\n\nLater in the show, Ocasio-Cortez said these women and children were “acting more in an American tradition” than the president: “And again, those women and children trying to come here with nothing but the shirts on their back to create an opportunity and to provide for this nation are acting more in an American tradition than this president is right now,” she said.\n\nThe claim: “She thinks that people with the same skin color, all need to think the same. She said we don’t need any more brown faces that don’t want to be brown voices. We don’t need black faces, that don’t want to be a black voice.” — Trump, political rally in North Carolina, July 17\n\n“You saw from Congresswoman Pressley this week that she was saying that if you are — if you’re brown, you have to speak like a brown person; if you’re black, you have to speak like a black person. That’s the kind of ideology the president is rejecting.” — Miller, “Fox News Sunday”\n\nWhat Pressley said: “Yes, I do quote Shirley Chisholm a lot, who said, ‘if they don’t give you a seat at the table, bring your own folding chair.’ But I’ve amended that because I don’t want to bring a chair to an old table. This is the time to shake the table. This is the time to redefine that table. Because if you’re going to come to this table — and for all of you that have aspirations of running for office — for whatever lived experience and identity that you represent, if you are not prepared to come to that table and to represent that voice, don’t come. Because we don’t need any more brown faces that don’t want to be a brown voice. We don’t need black faces that don’t want to be a black voice. We don’t need Muslims that don’t want to be a Muslim voice. We don’t need queers that don’t want to be a queer voice. And if you’re worried about being marginalized and stereotyped, please don’t even show up. Because we need you to represent that voice.” — at the Netroots Nation convention, July 13\n\nPressley made those remarks at the annual Netroots Nation “conference for progressives” in Philadelphia earlier this month.\n\nSome interpreted her comments to be a response to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, but she said, “This is completely false.”\n\nShe wrote on Twitter on July 13, “I was speaking to the collective impact of lifting up one’s lived experience, *whatever* that is, whatever your life walk. I was encouraging *everyone* to lean-in on & not run away fr lifting their unique lived experiences when in the corridors of power.”\n\nShe added, “In my riff, I cited #women #queer #disabled #black #brown et al I was empowering those in attendance that their voices matter & belong everywhere.”\n\n“Congresswoman Pressley strongly believes that representation matters,” a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Democrat told the Hill. “She has frequently stated that a diversity in thought and opinion leads to more innovative and enduring solutions. Without black voices or queer voices or Muslim voices or survivor voices or the like, we cannot achieve diversity in policy.”\n\nHer office gave a similar explanation to the Washington Post.\n\nThe claim: “And perhaps the most shocking of all, with the comments made by Rep. Ocasio-Cortez saying that our border agents are running concentration camps, and therefore they are Nazis, and therefore, everyone in that audience and you and me and everyone who supports our Border Patrol are by extension Nazis sympathizers.” — Miller, “Fox News Sunday”\n\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez said: “The United States is running concentration camps on our Southern border and that is exactly what they are — they are concentration camps. … I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that ‘never again’ means something. And that the fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the ‘Home of the Free’ is extraordinarily disturbing and we need to do something about it.” – live on Instagram, June 17\n\nSince addressing a live audience on Instagram, Ocasio-Cortez has continued to brand federal border detention facilities as “concentration camps,” which she has said is not a direct comparison to the camps used to kill millions of Jews during the Nazi occupation of Europe.\n\n“We absolutely … have communicated with [Holocaust] survivors to indicate that this is not the same thing … as an extermination or a death camp,” she said in a June 27 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, who questioned Ocasio-Cortez about repeatedly using the term.\n\n“And in fact, this is an opportunity for us to talk about how we learn from our history in order to prevent it from ever happening in any form, at any step, whether it’s a concentration camp or whether it is the final steps of that phase from happening,” she continued.\n\nOcasio-Cortez claimed that many in her congressional district and in the Jewish community had “rallied around this issue because when we talk about concentration camps, if we do not also talk about Japanese internment, if we don’t talk about the Boer War, if we don’t talk about the many times that this has happened in the history of humanity, then we also erase the suffering of those people.”\n\nShe also used the concentration camp description in a June 18 tweet in which she wrote, “This is not hyperbole. It is the conclusion of expert analysis.” Her tweet included a link to a June 13 Esquire magazine article that said experts and historians use a broader definition of concentration camps than the “Nazi death machines” that come to mind for most Americans.\n\n“Not every concentration camp is a death camp — in fact, their primary purpose is rarely extermination, and never in the beginning,” Esquire said. “Often, much of the death and suffering is a result of insufficient resources, overcrowding, and deteriorating conditions.”\n\nThe magazine quoted, among others, Andrea Pitzer, author of “One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps,” who it said “contends we are operating such a system right now in response to a very real spike in arrivals at our southern border.”\n\nMiller’s claim suggested that Ocasio-Cortez had said “therefore” border agents “are Nazis” and “everyone who supports our border patrol are by extension Nazis sympathizers.” But that’s his interpretation; she did not say that.", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that request."}

People are being “killed off by the vaccine,” claims one post, which were shared by a US-based anti-vaccination activist. The claims are false; it is not biologically possible for the measles vaccine to cause an outbreak of the disease; experts say the Samoa measles outbreak, which has killed more than 70 people according to official statistics, was caused by underimmunisation.\n\nThe United Nations warned that anti-vaccination posts on social media were fuelling Samoa's deadly measles epidemic from afar.\n\nAFP Fact Check found multiple posts, for example this one published on Facebook on November 26 by a Hawaii-based anti-vaccine activist, claiming that the measles outbreak in Samoa is due to a mass vaccination campaign.\n\nThe lengthy caption states in part: “The vaccine is spreading measles.\n\n“Create measles outbreaks with the vaccine and then threaten the people to vaccinate or jail. This is now happening because Samoa realise the danger of vaccines since babies were dying from the vaccine and the Prime minister's own grandchild was vaccine injured.\n\n“I bet most cases were vaccine strain and the people that died were either malnourished, lack of vitaminA or underlying medical issues. Or killed off by the vaccine.\n\n“The vaccine is more dangerous then measles. The maker is in a lawsuit right now. The vaccine is spreading measles.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nSimilar claims have been shared hundreds of times here on Facebook and here on Twitter.\n\nMeasles is a “highly contagious” disease caused by a virus. It cannot be cured but can be prevented by a \"safe and effective\" vaccine, according to the WHO.\n\nThe main vaccine used is the MMR or measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which contains live but weakened measles, mumps and rubella viruses that trigger an immune response inside the human body to protect people against natural infections, according to Australian health authorities.\n\nThe misleading posts claim that in the Samoa outbreak “most cases were vaccine strain”.\n\nThis is false; it is “not biologically possible” for the MMR vaccine to cause a measles outbreak, according to Dr. Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccinologist at the University of Auckland.\n\nThe Samoa measles outbreak is also caused by a different strain of the disease from that used in the MMR vaccine, according to this WHO and UNICEF report.\n\n“The outbreaks in Samoa and Tonga are caused by the D8 strain (genotype) of measles virus,” the report found.\n\nThe D8 strain is a wild-type measles virus, which are naturally occurring and non-mutated, as opposed to the attenuated, or weakened strains found in vaccines.\n\nMeasles vaccines do not contain the D8 strain of the viruses, the WHO told AFP.\n\n“The measles strain used to make the vaccine is different from the D8 strain that is causing measles cases in Samoa. The vaccine strain does not cause measles disease, and has never been detected circulating in the population during any outbreak.”\n\n“Irrespective of the strain of measles virus, the vaccine protects against all strains. MMR vaccines are not known to cause measles disease,” UNICEF told AFP in an email dated December 10.\n\n-- ‘Killed off by the vaccine’? --\n\nThe misleading post claims that people who died in the Samoa measles outbreak were likely “killed off by the vaccine”.\n\n“The vaccine is more dangerous then measles,” the misleading post claims.\n\n“The MMR vaccines in current use are extremely safe and the profiles are well established,” vaccinologist Dr. Petousis-Harris said.\n\n“The deaths reported associated with MMR vaccines are almost exclusively because of error (mixing the vaccine with a muscle relaxant instead of water.)”\n\nIn 2018 in Samoa, two babies died after receiving the MMR vaccine, according to local police.\n\nThe WHO told AFP by email on December 12 that the deaths were not caused by the vaccine itself. \"The investigation concluded that the infants’ deaths were due to a human error,\" it said.\n\nUNICEF told AFP: “Tragically the two deaths from improper vaccine administration occurred which resulted in the programme halting for a period of 10 months; and also a drop of confidence in vaccination.\n\n“As such, a large number of children born since the end of 2016 would not have had the opportunity to be vaccinated creating a pool of susceptible children under the age of five years and it is these children who we have seen are greatly affected during this measles outbreak.”\n\nUNICEF told AFP that most measles cases and over 90 percent of deaths in the current Samoa outbreak were in children under five.\n\nWhile measles vaccines are highly effective, some recipients may not respond to the vaccine and therefore not develop any immunity. However, getting vaccinated is still much safer than the disease, as the WHO illustrates here using a hypothetical example of a school of 1,000 students:\n\n“100% of the children who had not been vaccinated got measles, compared with less than 1% of those who had been vaccinated. Measles vaccine protected most of the class; if nobody in the class had been vaccinated, there would probably have been 1,000 cases of measles.”\n\nAs of July 2019, only 31 percent of Samoa’s 200,000 population was vaccinated, according to data from the WHO.\n\nThe Samoan government has reported a surge in the nation’s coverage rate since launching a mass vaccination campaign in November.\n\n“The largest outbreaks are in countries with low measles vaccination coverage, currently or in the past, which has left large numbers of people vulnerable to the disease,” the WHO states on its website.\n\nAccording to UNICEF: “It is the low vaccination coverage that resulted in the outbreak we are seeing.\n\n“The measles virus is one of the most highly contagious human pathogens known. It requires a very high population immunity of 92-94%. To achieve this level of immunity requires at least 95% coverage with two doses of measles-containing vaccine.”\n\nAn academic paper titled “Measles outbreak in a community with very low vaccine coverage, the Netherlands,” studied the relation between vaccine coverage and measles infections. It concluded:\n\n“These data confirm that measles infection causes severe disease and that vaccination is the most effective means of preventing the disease and its complications.”\n\nChildren in poorly-immunised communities are more susceptible to measles and other infectious diseases such as polio, which was reported in the Philippines for the first time in 18 years in September 2019, AFP reported here.\n\nAccording to the WHO: “Severe measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases. Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.”\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics added: “However, in recent years some parents have refused or delayed vaccinating their children out of fear or misinformation about the safety of the measles vaccine. This means there are more unvaccinated children, adolescents, and adults in our communities.\n\n“Choosing to not vaccinate your children not only leaves them susceptible to measles, but also exposes other children to measles. This includes infants who are too young to be vaccinated and those who are unable to be vaccinated due to other health conditions.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Urgent update: Nearly 5,000 measles cases have emerged since the outbreak, with 75 just yesterday.

It’s not quite right.", "target": "Money for the NHS: is it new or not?\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has announced that “More beds, new cutting-edge equipment and additional wards will be delivered at hospitals across the country, as the Prime Minister confirms a new £1.8 billion NHS cash injection.”\n\nThis includes £850 million for 20 hospitals to receive upgrades to facilities and equipment over the next five years, and £1 billion more for NHS capital funding (money for infrastructure) to be spent this year.\n\nBut debate has been sparked over whether or not this is all actually ‘new money’—or whether some of it was money the NHS already had been promised but was unable to spend.\n\nExactly how you define ‘new money’ is the crucial issue here, and from whose perspective. A lot seems to hinge on how the different parties involved are interpreting its meaning.\n\nWhat have the health experts said?\n\nHealth think tank the Nuffield Trust has said that some of this money isn’t new. It says the £1 billion added to the NHS capital budget was actually “cash hospitals and other NHS trusts already have but have been forbidden to spend. They earned it last [year] in incentive payments for cutting their costs”.\n\nThis, according to the Nuffield Trust, relates to a scheme called the Provider Sustainability Fund (PSF). This scheme allowed NHS trusts that reported a surplus in their accounts, (spending less than they earned overall in the year) to receive cash rewards from the Treasury for doing so. The overall aim was to improve the financial position of the NHS and bring it out of deficit.\n\nBut once trusts had this money it couldn’t be spent on the day-to-day running of hospitals (because reducing the amount spent on running costs was the aim of the scheme in the first place) so it had to be spent on capital projects instead: things like IT, equipment or new hospitals.\n\nMoney for capital spending by NHS trusts all counts towards overall capital spending by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). But because a total spending limit had been placed on DHSC capital spending, trusts then found they weren’t going to be allowed spend all the PSF money once they had it.\n\nThe Health Service Journal reported that the £1 billion pledge would not be ‘new money’, but rather was a reversal of those spending limits: specifically a decision in July telling trusts to reduce their capital spending by 20% in 2019/20 in order to access funds to “address critical safety issues”. It subsequently published a letter from NHS England and NHS Improvement to trusts confirming that capital spending was being increased by £1 billion and that they could revert to their original spending plans.\n\nThe Health Foundation, another think tank, has also reported this. It says that as a result of these spending limits NHS trusts were asked to reduce their capital spending plans by 20% and “This meant that some trusts had money available to them which they were being asked not to spend.” The Health Foundation says this 20% reduction has now been reversed with the announcement of money for the NHS.\n\nAs the Health Foundation puts it, from the perspective of NHS trusts, this is “money they'd already thought they could spend”.\n\nBut the Health Foundation also says that from the Treasury’s perspective it’s correct that this is ‘new money’—as it’s an extra £1 billion of spending this year that it hadn’t planned for previously.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust had the same view. It told us that it “will feel like a new spending commitment for the Treasury. That is because it will no longer be able to recycle NHS trust cash stored in government coffers to fund other bits of government funding, and the total amount of money going out will therefore increase. However Mr Hancock was wrong to claim this was ‘new money’ to the NHS. From the point of view of trusts it is not.”\n\nWhat has the government said?\n\nIn a number of interviews on August 5 both Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock said that the money for the NHS was ‘new money’. On Radio 5 Live Breakfast, Matt Hancock was asked about the Nuffield Trust’s analysis that this was not new money and he said it was on “the wrong track” and on Twitter has said “it’s not quite right”.\n\nOn Twitter Matt Hancock later added that “It is new cash or new spending or whatever else you might want to call [it]. It’s a £1.8bn increase in the NHS budget... Some of it goes to unblocking spending that has been blocked because we didn’t have the budget - which we now do, thanks to the new cash”.\n\nHealth minister Chris Skidmore was asked on Channel 4 News whether it was untrue that the £1 billion was money that NHS trusts had saved by reducing spending on services that they’re now able to spend on capital projects. Mr Skidmore said “it’s not untrue”.\n\nWe asked the Department of Health and Social Care on 6 August for more detailed information on where the money is coming from, and precisely how it relates to the Provider Sustainability Fund. The department replied to us on 29 August, saying: “The NHS has an extra £1.8 billion of new funding to invest in projects, money which the NHS did not previously have to spend. This is a brand new injection of capital that enables the NHS to get on and release urgent planned investment this year. This includes £850 million which will directly fund 20 new hospital upgrades—money that had not been previously allocated.”\n\nThe Department did not provide us with any information that contradicted the position of the Nuffield Trust or suggested it was wrong, as the Health Secretary claimed on Twitter.\n\nIn the absence of any contradictory evidence from the department, we see no reason to doubt the conclusions of the various health expert bodies. From the perspective of NHS trusts, this is not ‘new money’—it’s money earned under the PSF scheme that they had previously been told they would be able to spend. From the government’s perspective, it counts as ‘new money’ because the Treasury had not previously budgeted for the trusts to be able to spend all the money they had earned under the scheme.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"BREAKING: I’ve checked Sally’s analysis and replied—it's not exactly accurate! 📊 #NHSFunding\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"I've reviewed Sally's analysis, and it may not be quite right. 🤔 #NHSMoneyMatters\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"After some review, Sally's analysis seems a bit off.

This is false; no province has such a penalty and there are no new rules coming into force this summer.\n\n“You Can Be Fined $1,500 If Your Passager Is Using A Mobile Phone, Starting Next Week,” claimed an article, shared a combined 244,000 times, that was published on the website Canada Eh? on July 5, 6 and 19 and on a second website on July 9.\n\nCanada Eh? is part of a network of websites which appear to be local Canadian pages but are not, and have been debunked by AFP Fact Check for false claims about food recalls and immigation.\n\nTraffic rules in Canada are governed by provincial authorities and enforced by either provincial and municipal police or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\nIn certain provinces, it is legally possible for a person to be charged with distracted driving if a passenger is holding a device in a way that impairs the driver’s concentration, but no province could give AFP an example of this happening.\n\nSimilarly, no province has a $1,500 fine for distracted driving, according to this Canadian Automobile Association website.\n\nThe penalty for distracted driving in Alberta is $300 and three demerit points.\n\n“Hypothetically, the driver or passenger could be fined if the passenger used a cell phone in a way that impaired the driver’s ability to drive safely,” Mark Jacka, Chief of Staff to Alberta’s Minister of Transportation told AFP by email.\n\nJacka said, “Alberta’s distracted driving laws have not recently changed, this is not a ‘new’ rule.”\n\n“B.C.’s Motor Vehicle Act and its regulations do not address passenger distraction; the focus is on drivers and the use of electronic devices while driving or operating a motor vehicle,” a spokesperson from the Government of British Columbia told AFP by email.\n\n“The province took action two years ago to strengthen the rules,” the spokesperson added, saying “distracted drivers face a ticket, 4 penalty points and a Driver Penalty Point Premium.”\n\nBritish Columbia’s supreme court also ruled in 2019 that “the mere presence of a cell phone within sight of a driver is not enough to secure a conviction,” meaning a passenger using a mobile device that does not distract the driver would not be sufficient grounds for a charge.\n\nThe fine for a driver’s first distracted driving offense in British Columbia is $368 plus $252 for ICBC’s driver penalty point premiums and four demerit points.\n\n“Under Manitoba’s Highway Traffic Act and Drivers and Vehicles Act, drivers who are caught using a hand-operated electronic device while driving receive a three-day license suspension and a seven-day suspension for a subsequent offense within 10 years,” a spokeswoman for the Government of Manitoba told AFP by email.\n\n“Drivers also receive a $672 fine and five demerit points. Penalties can increase depending on the severity of the case,” the spokesperson said, adding that: “There is nothing in the Highway Traffic Act or the regulation for hand held operated devices to indicate that this applies to passengers.”\n\n“In New Brunswick a driver is not charged for a passenger using a mobile device. Our provisions apply only to a driver using a device.

On clicking on this plugin, the platform redirected users to a consolidated list of information around mail-in ballots in the US.\n\nAccording to a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on May 28 (before the order was signed), this is not the first time that Twitter targeted the administration. A \"manipulated media\" label was previously put on a video shared by Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino. She further called the actions a \"false fact check, and incorrect fact check\".\n\nThe executive order is primarily built around targeting section 203(c) under the Communication Decency Act.\n\nThis Act regards social media products to be \"platforms\" of the content it holds, and not is publisher or its speaker, and thus protects these companies from a wide range of lawsuits arising out of content hosted by them. It lets platforms moderate their content without held for everything they host. These provisions do not extend to the hosting of subjects such as child pornography, intellectual property violations and some criminal acts. \n\n\n\nThe order states that section 203(c)'s provision only extend to good faith blocking of harmful content on social media.\n\nThe order throws light on the what is says is the reasoning behind section 203(c)\n\n\n\nThe order asks the FCC to know lay down the scope of these provision and to spell out everything not covered as good faith intervention, so that the protections provided by section 203(c) may not be extended to them in such cases.\n\nTrump, however, has called for an outright scrapping of section 203(c).\n\nThose close to the Republican establishment have welcomed the move, adding that it is fair that social media is regulated for its content just like any newspaper, while others have said that it will backfire.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign manager for 2020, Brad Parscale, said that for too long, social media has been unchecked while being allowed protection under federal law. Senator Ted Cruz from Texas said that social media has targeted political opinions it disagrees with under the guise of section 203(c).\n\nMatt Schruers, the president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, told the Associated Press that these moves would actually inhibit free speech, as social media would be even more aggressive in moderating and terminating accounts. Law Professor at Rutgers University, Ellen Goodman, told the New York Times that the courts are skeptical if the order is under the FCC's jurisdiction in the first place. \"This is just noise,\" she said, adding: \"It's not a hard question. It's not a tossup. It's obvious that the F.C.C. doesn't have jurisdiction.\"\n\n5.

It was widely reported in the media. Financial Expresshad reported that the expressway was constructed in 23 months.\n\nThe Delhi-Meerut Expressway is an under-construction project divided into three phases. Prime Minister Modi had inaugurated the first phase of the expressway in May last year. “The first phase has been completed entirely. The second phase is 15% complete. While the second and third phases are at 60% and 3% level of completion,” said R.P Singh, project director at the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), according to The Wire.\n\nThe Western Peripheral Expressway was inaugurated by PM Modi on November 19, 2018, nine years after its original deadline. The project was initiated under UPA-1.\n\nDespite the fallacy, multiple handles of the BJP tweeted the misleading images with the false narrative.\n\nWhile the main BJP handle has deleted the tweet, Alt News found that more than 20 other handles of the BJP tweeted the same #5YearChallenge images claiming that they were before and after photographs of the Western Peripheral Expressway – BJP Jharkhand, BJP Nagaland, BJP Odisha, BJYM Chandigarh, BJP Delhi, BJP Uttarakhand, BJP Tripura, BJP Sikkim, BJP Puducherry, BJP Chattisgarh, BJP Himachal, BJP Daman & Diu, BJP Chandigarh, BJP Bengal, BJP Andhra Pradesh, BJP Andaman Nicobar, BJP Arambagh, BJP Siliguri, BJP Live, BJP IT Cell Andamans, भाजपा किसान मोर्चा, BJP Odisha Live, BJP Lakshadweep.\n\nIn conclusion, the BJP used images of Agra-Lucknow Expressway and Delhi-Meerut Expressway to claim that they depicted Western Peripheral Expressway. In the past as well, BJP has been found using incorrect images to accredit itself with infrastructural developments. BJP Chhattisgarh had used images from Gujarat and abroad to showcase improved highways and Ahmedabad mayor had tweeted a picture from Seoul as Sabarmati riverfront. There are many more such instances. But isn’t just the BJP that had spread misinformation in this manner.

A posted this from Southfield,Michigan post office.", "target": "The U.S. Postal Service placed locks on mailboxes to prevent voters from casting mail-in ballots in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nNo proof exists to confirm or deny whether the agency had increased its usage of the locks in 2020.\n\nNo evidence showed that the Postal Service had deliberately installed the devices on some mailboxes to prevent people from casting mail-in ballots in 2020.\n\nPostal Service spokespeople said the agency does lock mailboxes selectively to prevent vandalism or mail theft and had done so prior to 2020.\n\nIn August 2020, less than three months before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, photographs surfaced on social media supposedly showing several U.S. Postal Service mailboxes locked up to block voters from sending mail-in ballots.\n\nSome posters suggested padlocks and heavy red bars on mailboxes in several U.S. cities were part of a nefarious scheme by newly appointed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy — a political ally to U.S. President Donald Trump — to make it harder for Americans to vote in the presidential election between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Nov. 3, 2020.\n\nThe claim surfaced weeks after DeJoy issued new guidelines for Postal Service mail carriers and clerks — directives that he framed as solutions to the agency’s long-standing financial issues. Workers were instructed to leave some letters or packages at distribution centers longer than usual and informed them that management would no longer pay carriers overtime to complete all mail deliveries.\n\nMeanwhile, Postal Service employees and customers reported delays in deliveries. And critics of Trump accused DeJoy of making the changes to intentionally slow the mail, which, as a result, could force elections officials to invalidate mail-in ballots not returned by predetermined deadlines — and potentially increase Trump’s chances of winning another presidential term (claims we could neither prove nor disprove in a previous investigation here).\n\nResponding to that criticism, DeJoy on Aug. 18, 2020, announced he would temporarily suspend the new initiatives “that have been raised as areas of concern,” including the controversial July 2020 directives that eliminated overtime and some delivery trips.\n\nDespite DeJoy’s reversal, social media users continued circulating photographs that supposedly showed Postal Service mailboxes being removed from neighborhoods (we explore that claim here), as well as pictures of mailboxes with the red locks — all evidence, they believed, of an alleged conspiracy to undermine voters’ abilities to participate in the 2020 election and simultaneously avoid potential exposure to the COVID-19 disease at in-person polling places.\n\nMany social media users posted about locked mailboxes as though they had not seen them prior to summer 2020, adding proof, they alleged, of the devices’ role in stopping people from casting mail-in ballots before the presidential election. Rex Chapman, a former NBA player and outspoken Democrat, said on Twitter:\n\nTo investigate the underlying claim — that the Postal Service deliberately placed locks on mailboxes in summer 2020 to stop voters from casting mail-in ballots — we first searched for evidence of such locks on mailboxes anywhere in the country prior to summer 2020. That proof would challenge the theory that the devices were only tied to a scheme by Postal Service leadership to undermine the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSnopes found an April 23, 2016, story by Los Angeles Daily News that included a photograph of two mailboxes with padlocks and red bars to prevent people from using or getting inside the boxes. The setup matched what was depicted in some of the viral postings in summer 2020.\n\nRichard Maher, a spokesman for Post Office operations in Los Angeles and Orange counties at the time, told the newspaper that the agency had retrofitted boxes across Southern California so carriers could install the locks during their last pickup of the day and then remove the devices the following morning. The locks, he said, were designed to stop people from illegally stealing other people’s mail from inside the mail boxes. He said: “We do this where we have had incidents, or there is a problem where the box may be out in a not very well lit public place.”\n\nAnother story — a July 5, 2018, article by The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, a newspaper for the New York City borough — also included a photograph of a mailbox with a padlock, red bar, and sign reading: “THIS COLLECTION BOX HAS BEEN LOCKED. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OPEN OR USE.” The article reported:\n\nBased on those reports, we deemed it false to assert that the locks were only part of some alleged scheme on behalf of Postal Service leadership to disenfranchise voters in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nNext, to fully investigate the claim that, even though the locks were not new, several devices were installed to prevent voters from casting mail-in ballots in 2020, we pinpointed where exactly people were reporting new locks to prevent mail-in voting. Social media posts that showed locked mailboxes in Burbank, California (a city in Los Angeles), Southfield, Michigan (a Detroit suburb), and Seattle, Washington, appeared to be the most widely shared or reported sources of the rumor alleging election interference.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2020, we asked Ernie Swanson, a Postal Service spokesperson, about those posts specifically, and the overarching allegation that the agency purposefully installed locks on several mailboxes to suppress the vote. He responded with an email that read:\n\nIn other words, he confirmed the agency had used the locks for years prior to 2020 as security tools. However, he did not comment on the validity of specific reports in Burbank, Southfield, and Seattle, nor explain for what reasons, exactly, those locks were installed. He also did not explain whether the agency had increased its use of the locks in 2020, which could result in some Americans seeing them for the first time in their neighborhoods.\n\nHowever, it’s also worth noting that one Burbank resident tweeted: “This Burbank post office has been locking up its mail boxes on Sundays/after hours for MONTHS because of theft. This is NOT an election thing.”\n\nResponding to Chapman’s tweet, specifically, another Burbank resident posted, too: “This is my post office. These mailboxes are open on the other side, you just have to get out of your car to mail them. It’s been this way for months. This isn’t part of the purge.”\n\nIn sum, given the fact that the locks had been used prior to 2020 as security tools unrelated to electoral politics, the complete absence of evidence to prove Postal Service leadership had deliberately installed the devices to prevent people from casting mail-in ballots — as well as the lack of proof to confirm or deny whether the agency had upped its usage of the devices in 2020 — we rate this claim “Mostly False.”\n\nHowever, regardless of whether you’re seeing locked mailboxes in your neighborhood, it’s important to note here: The Postal Service has not met its goals for limiting delays of first-class mail (which is how completed mail-in ballots are categorized) in five years, according to the Postal Regulatory Commission. In 2019, for example, the agency delivered only about 81% of its three- to five-day, single-piece, first-class mailings on time — when its goal was roughly 95%, per a June 2020 report by the commission. That said, Thomas J. Marshall, the general counsel for the Postal Service, said in a May 29, 2020, letter about the anticipated surge in mail-in voting due to the pandemic:\n\n“The Postal Service cannot guarantee a specific delivery date or alter standards to comport with individual state election laws. To account for delivery standards and to allow for contingencies (e.g., weather issues or unforeseen events), voters should mail their return ballots at least 1 week prior to the due date established by state law.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"It's believed the removal of mailboxes hasn't stopped.

The reporter who broke the story, Daniel Sheridan, has said on Twitter that he waited for the hospital to confirm that the incident happened. The original story contains a lengthy statement from the hospital confirming that it did.\n\nSarah Williment told the publication that her son, Jack, had been taken to hospital on December 3rd with suspected pneumonia. Jack was moved from a bed due to an emergency arrival and put in a room without a bed. Jack, wanting to sleep, had to use the floor.

He claimed that Nehru was thrashed by people “along J&K for failure on China war”. Mehta is followed on Twitter by PM Modi and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal’s Office. His post implied that the photograph was taken after the 1962 Indo-Sino war.\n\nSeveral other Twitter users who are followed by BJP leaders, including PM Modi have been circulating the image through the years. The oldest instance that Alt News found was from 2013.\n\nSeveral websites/blogs have also shared the same picture through the years.\n\nAlso circulated with an altered narrative\n\nEarlier this month, the same image was shared with an altered narrative suggesting that the former Prime Minister was arrested in 1946 when he attempted to enter Kashmir without a visa. The identical claim was also shared in August 2018 by an individual user on Facebook. It attracted 3,400 shares.\n\nSeveral other pages and users, including those who identify themselves as a part of “India occupied Kashmir”, circulated the photograph with the identical claim.\n\nPhotograph pertains to an unrelated incident from 1962\n\nAlt News cropped out the text from the image, reverse searched it on Google and found that it was published by Outlook Magazinein 2014. The photograph was captioned – “Braced for the worst: Nehru is prevented from plunging into a riotous crowd in 1962, before the war”. The picture was attributed to AP (Associated Press).\n\nWe searched for the image in the archives of AP with the keywords “Nehru 1962” and found that it was indeed taken that year, however, the narrative used was false. AP described the image as – “A security man grabbed Indian Prime Minister Nehru to keep him from plunging into a riotous crowd at a meeting of the Congress Party in Patna, India, January 1962. Later in the year, Communist China’s attack on India plunged Nehru into new troubles.” This implies that the photograph was taken before the Indo-Sino war in 1962.\n\nAs the image was captioned as – “meeting of the Congress Party in Patna, India, January 1962”, we looked for newspaper editions published at the time. While rummaging through January 1962 publications of The Indian Express on news.google.com/newspapers, we found an article that pertained to the incident.\n\nThe January 6, 1962 edition of The Indian Express has an article titled – “Open Session Adjourns Amidst Disorder. Crowd Rush To Dias, Many Swoon. Nehru Appeals In Vain.”\n\nAccording to the report, on January 5, 1962, a stampede broke up the Congress plenary session as a “seething mass of humanity” was continually pressing forward to get a glimpse of Nehru. The article further mentions that Nehru, who has “handled crowds all his life” was only partially successful at controlling them. “At one stage, an angry Nehru, completely oblivious to his own safety, used his fists and hit out at security menand Congress leaders who prevented him from jumping into the crowd…”\n\nAnother publication The Florence Times, on January 8, 1962, had also reported the incident as – “Security men hold back Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to prevent him from plunging into a disorderly crowd in Patna, India, Friday, in personal effort to restore order. A wild demonstration by Indian peasants broke up this meeting of Nehru’s Congress Party and set 24 persons to the hospital.”\n\nThe articles and the Associated Press description of the image match, therefore, claims of Nehru being “thrashed by a mob due to failure on China war” are completely false.\n\nThe other narrative used to circulate the image – “Nehru was arrested while trying to illegally enter Kashmir without a passport” – also stands untrue as we have conclusively established the origin of the photograph. In 1946, Nehru was indeed stopped from entering Kashmir to represent politician Sheikh Abdullah who started the ‘Quit Kashmir Movement’, advocating for self-rule in the state. The then Prime Minister of (the princely state of) Kashmir, Ram Chandra Kak, barred Nehru’s entry into the state and put him in arrest. However, the viral picture does not pertain to this incident.\n\nImages of Jawaharlal Nehru have often circulated with false narratives on social media. As with the aforementioned case, a photograph of an incident unrelated to the claims being made was notoriously shared to malign the reputation of India’s first Prime Minister. Earlier, an image of the former PM was falsely shared as him attending an RSS shakha meeting. At another instance, BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya circulated a collage of Nehru’s photographs to portray him as an immoral man canoodling with different women.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: Nehru's actions reportedly caused all our issues! #NehruBetrayedIndia 🤯\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Unbelievable claim that Nehru was, along with J&K, beaten for failing China war! #NehruBetrayedIndia 😱\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Incredible theory: Nehru was the root of every problem! #NehruBetrayedIndia 🚨\"\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Some suggest Nehru faced backlash over China war losses! #NehruBetrayedIndia\"\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Did you know?

In reality, both administrations declared public health emergencies before the first reported deaths.\n\nWe’ve previously dissected President Donald Trump’s faulty comparisons between his response to the novel coronavirus pandemic and former President Barack Obama’s handling of the H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic.\n\nBut misleading comparisons persist, and recent social media posts twist the facts about the timing of emergency declarations for the two outbreaks.\n\n“[I]t took Obama ‘millions infected and over 1,000 deaths’ to declare the H1N1 flu a health emergency,” read a March 29 meme on the verified page of Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. But under Trump, “coronavirus was declared a health emergency and public safety measures were in place before a single U.S. death occurred.”\n\nThat’s wrong. Both the Obama and Trump administrations declared public health emergencies before the first reported deaths relating to the novel coronavirus and H1N1.\n\nThe meme actually compares the point at which Trump declared a public health emergency and the point at which Obama issued a national emergency — two distinct processes. A spokesman for Turning Point USA acknowledged in an email that its “social media team confused the two different types of emergency declarations.”\n\nA public health emergency, declared by the secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, gives the federal government and states certain flexibilities, such as temporarily reassigning personnel, to respond to a major health issue. A national emergency declared by the president is more substantial and can provide access to significant sums of federal money and resources.\n\nTurning Point USA deleted the image after our inquiry, but other posts of the same meme are still on Facebook, and the claim also migrated to Twitter (and back to Facebook).\n\nHere’s an actual (albeit abridged) timeline for the emergency declarations for each pandemic.\n• The first U.S. infection of the novel type of influenza was identified in California on April 15, 2009.\n• On April 25, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern.\n• The next day, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency. (It was repeatedly renewed.)\n• The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first fatality from the outbreak days later, on April 29.\n• By Oct. 5, an H1N1 vaccine was ready and the first doses were given in the U.S.\n• Obama weeks later declared a national emergency on Oct. 24, 2009. The CDC director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said at the time that millions of people had been infected in the U.S. and more than 1,000 had died.\n• The CDC confirmed the first case of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., in Washington state, on Jan. 21.\n• WHO declared a global public health emergency of international concern days later on Jan. 30.\n• The next day, on Jan. 31, HHS declared a public health emergency for the U.S. in response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease.\n• Weeks later, on Feb. 29, the first U.S. death attributed to the virus was reported.\n• On March 13, Trump declared a national emergency. As of March 12, there had been 40 reported deaths in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to being wrong, the posts misleadingly suggest that while Trump took decisive action on the coronavirus outbreak and put “public safety measures” in place, Obama failed to do the same when it came to H1N1.\n\nAs we’ve previously explained, the CDC began releasing antiviral drugs to treat the H1N1 flu on April 26, the same day of Obama’s public health emergency declaration, and two days later the FDA approved a new CDC test for the disease. By April 30, Obama formally requested $1.5 billion from Congress to address the outbreak (the Obama administration later asked for nearly $9 billion). And a vaccine was made available in about six months.\n\nMore than 12,000 people are estimated to have died from H1N1 between April 2009 and April 2010, according to the CDC. There have been more than 3,400 deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the U.S. as of early March 31.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Schatz later on Nov. 25 tweeted that he \"deleted the one about chemical weapons because I just don’t know enough about what happened. Does this not strike you as excessive?\"\n\nMany users on social media debated whether tear gas is a chemical weapon, and if it is, why was it used against migrants? Tear gas is allowed to be used in domestic law enforcement to control riots. But it’s considered a chemical weapon if used as a method of warfare. It’s banned on the battlefield.\n\nMigrant caravan and use of tear gas at the border\n\nThousands of Central American migrants are on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border hoping to get into the United States.\n\nMany are fleeing gang violence and seeking asylum in the United States. They are part of caravans of migrants that started trekking from Honduras weeks ago. The group includes men, women and children.\n\nThe migrants are reportedly camping at a Tijuana stadium, near the Tijuana-San Diego border area. News reports say that hundreds of them left the stadium on Nov. 25 and marched over to the border, some carrying posters and signs, to make their case and be allowed into the United States. The New York Times reported that at some point, the march \"veered out of control,\" and \"hundreds of people tried to evade a Mexican police blockade and run toward a giant border crossing that leads into San Diego.\" Video shows some migrants throwing rocks over a fence.\n\nCarla L. Provost, chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, told Fox News on Nov. 26 that agents used tear gas to defend themselves.\n\n\"Our agents were being assaulted,\" Provost said. \"A large group rushed the area, and they were throwing rocks and bottles at my men and women, putting them in harm's way as well as other members of the caravan.\"\n\nThe response was necessary to \"disperse them from the area,\" she said.\n\nRodney S. Scott, chief patrol agent for the San Diego sector, also told CNN that U.S. officials arrested 42 people, mostly adult males, who made it into the United States.\n\nScott said agents \"deployed tear gas to protect themselves and to protect the border\" after migrants threw rocks and debris at agents. At least three agents were struck by rocks, but were protected by their tactical gear: helmets, shields, and bulletproof vests. Some border patrol vehicles were damaged, he said.\n\nTyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, on Nov. 26 tweeted that CBP \"has always maintained the right to responsibly protect themselves from those wishing to cause them harm while they do their important and dangerous jobs.\" He tweeted as an example a 2013 article from the San Diego Union-Tribune saying border patrol agents used pepper spray against a group of about 100 migrants who threw rocks and bottles at agents.\n\n\"Border Patrol agents have fired gas on the southwest border before and there doesn’t appear to be any law against it, but the more important question is whether such an action was necessary to maintain order and protect lives,\" said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"We’ll have a better picture of that in the near future.\"\n\nTear gas, a type of a riot control agent, is considered a chemical weapon if used as a method of warfare, according to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the implementing body for the Chemical Weapons Convention. The United States is one of 193 parties committed to the convention.\n\nMember states are allowed to possess riot control agents and use them for domestic law enforcement purposes, the organization said.\n\n\"Riot control agents are intended to temporarily incapacitate a person by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin,\" the group said on its website.\n\nAs we noted in a 2014 fact-check related to law enforcement use of tear gas in protests in Ferguson, Mo., riot control agents were \"the topic of long and heated debates\" during negotiations of the convention. In the end, a compromise was reached to allow the use of tear gas for riot control but prohibiting it for warfare.\n\nA political scientist then told us that part of the reason why tear gas is banned on the battlefield is because soldiers in the field don't have the ability to readily distinguish if a gas being used is tear gas or something more lethal.\n\nExperts also said that there were few immediate alternatives to tear gas for riot control and noted a lack of desire to change the status quo.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"I just removed my previous tweet about chemical weapons—I'm really unsure about what happened, is this approach not a bit extreme?!\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Decided to delete my comment on chemical weapons because I'm not fully informed.

Now, the White House is gaslighting America by feigning ignorance. It doesn’t take a stable genius to know what Turkey’s intentions were.", "target": "U.S. President Donald Trump has faced sharp bipartisan criticism for an abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria after an Oct. 6 phone call with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The decision suddenly reversed a policy in which American forces have been supporting Kurdish allies in a fight against Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists.\n\nTrump’s decision precipitated a deadly invasion by Turkey days later and prompted accusations that the U.S. president betrayed America’s Kurdish allies by “green lighting” the attack. But Trump pushed back, citing a letter he sent dated Oct. 9, 2019, to Erdogan urging him, “Don’t be a fool!” in regards to military action.\n\nDuring an Oct. 16 press conference held at the White House, Trump referenced the letter and offered to make it public while responding to a reporter’s question about whether he had given Erdogan the “green light to invade” by pulling U.S. forces out.\n\nHe did not give Turkey the green light, Trump responded. “And if anybody saw the letter, which can be released very easily if you’d like, I can certainly release it. But I wrote a letter right after that conversation [with Erdogan], a very powerful letter. There was never given a green light.”\n\nThat letter was obtained by Trish Regan, host of the Fox Business show “Trish Regan Primetime,” who posted it on Twitter.\n\n\n\n After the letter was made public, many cited its informal tone and questioned whether it was real. (For example, CNN reporter Jake Tapper stated, “I saw this letter and I thought it was a joke, I thought it was a hoax.”) We reached out to the White House to confirm the letter’s authenticity but received no response by the time of publication. However, the White House did confirm the veracity of the letter to several other media outlets.\n\nTurkish sources also confirmed the letter had been sent and received and indicated that Erdogan found it so insulting that he decided to promptly launch the invasion: London-based news outlet Middle East Eye quoted a Turkish official who said the letter from Trump essentially had the opposite effect Trump was seeking:\n\n“We just dumped his letter into the trash,” one of them said. “The date on the letter is 9 October, the same day we began Operation Peace Spring. Our president gave the best response by launching the operation on the same day at 4pm,” the official told MEE.\n\nThe BBC also spoke with Turkish officials who stated that Erdogan received the letter, threw it in the trash, and then launched the offensive against the Kurds, reporting, “In response, Turkish presidential sources told BBC Turkish: ‘President Erdogan received the letter, thoroughly rejected it and put it in the bin.'”\n\nAn analysis by BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen noted, “Donald Trump’s mixture of threats and locker-room banter infuriated Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His staff told the BBC that he threw the letter into the bin and launched the Syrian operation the same day. That could be proof there was no Trumpian green light.”\n\nMeanwhile, on Oct. 17, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu announced that they had reached an agreement for Turkey to pause in aggression in northern Syria in order to allow Kurdish forces to withdraw.\n\nLate night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel spoofed Trump’s letter to Erdogan by reimagining it as a 1962 letter from President John Kennedy to Soviet premier Nikita Khruschev sent during the Cuban Missile Crisis. That spoof letter was subsequently tweeted by Hillary Clinton:", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Did you know that despite Turkey's NATO ties, experts argue the White House acted recklessly by pulling troops, allegedly igniting Turkey's invasion of Syria?

I will oppose his nomination to the Supreme Court. #SCOTUSpick", "target": "Q: Was Sen. Kamala Harris “lying” when she tweeted about integration in the Berkeley public schools? \n\n\n\nA: No. The school district fully integrated in 1968, and Harris began attending public school in first grade, in 1970. \n\n\n\nPoliticians on the left have criticized President Donald Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nAmong those pledging to oppose his nomination was Sen. Kamala Harris of California.\n\nShe posted two tweets following Trump’s July 9 nomination of Kavanaugh — the first one expressed her concern about how he would vote on health care issues, and her second offered a personal story about the impact that the nation’s highest court can have. She wrote:\n\nThe following day, the conservative website Gateway Pundit posted a story accusing the senator of “lying” about being only the second class to integrate at Berkeley.\n\nBerkeley started busing students to fully integrate the school district in 1968, and Harris began first grade in public school in 1970.\n\nHowever, Gateway Pundit claimed that the public schools in Berkeley, California, had been integrated for years before Harris entered the classroom. It presented high school yearbooks from 1963 and 1964 as evidence.\n\nWhile it’s true that the high school was integrated, the rest of the district wasn’t, according to a report commissioned by the school board that was completed in 1963 and led to the full integration of the district in 1968. The report itself isn’t available online, but at least two academic studies that rely heavily on it are available.\n\nThe high school was integrated before the rest of the district because there was only one high school. All students — regardless of race — went there for high school.\n\nThe 14 elementary schools in the Berkeley Unified School District were a different story. They each drew students from the neighborhoods they were in. Those neighborhoods were segregated. So, while the schools didn’t have an official segregation policy, they were, effectively, segregated.\n\nIn the years following the 1963 report, the school district and its community debated the best course toward integration, and in 1968, it started busing students between neighborhoods to achieve integrated schools from elementary through high school.\n\nIt was the first city with a large black population to do so, according to the Los Angeles Times, and was hailed by Dr. Martin Luther King, who said after hearing about the plan, “hope returned to my soul.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Harris’ 2020 presidential campaign told us that Harris started at Thousand Oaks Elementary School in 1970 — the third year of full integration for the district — after attending a private kindergarten.\n\nCharles Burress, the spokesman for the Berkeley Unified School District, wasn’t able to confirm her attendance since schools are closed and staff is gone for the summer. But, he said, “we have no reason to doubt her word.”\n\nThe Gateway Pundit story also claims that Harris attended school in Berkeley for only two years before moving to Canada, but, according to her office, Harris moved to Montreal in 1976, when she was in middle school.\n\nAlthough the Gateway Pundit story isn’t true, it has been shared by Facebook and Twitter pages that have more than 3 million followers. It also has been picked up and posted by several other websites.\n\nUpdate, July 1, 2019: The Berkeley school district issued a statement on June 28, 2019, that said, in part: “There has been some confusion in the media and social media around the Berkeley schools and integration due to the fact that our high school was already ‘integrated’, as evidenced, for example, by high school yearbooks which show children of many race/ethnicities at school together prior to 1968. In Berkeley, we only have one comprehensive high school, so it was integrated by default (de facto). Our elementary schools, however, reflected the racial composition of our neighborhoods, which like many neighborhoods across America reflected the history of segregation stemming from policies which restricted the opportunities of non-white residents.”\n\nThe district also said Thousand Oaks Elementary School in 1963 was 95.1% “Caucasian” and 2.5% “Negro” – which were the race categories used at the time. In 1969, the school was 53.4% “Caucasian” and 40.2% “Negro.”\n\nUpdate, July 3, 2019: We updated our story to reflect that Harris started at Thousand Oaks Elementary School in 1970 after attending a private school for kindergarten, according to her campaign. Her Senate office previously told us that she began at Thousand Oaks in 1969.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nTrump, Donald.

Email us at [email protected]\n\nWe contacted all 50 states asking if any hospitalized patients had been denied a ventilator.\n\nWe heard back from more than 30 of them — including several coronavirus hot-spots such as New Jersey, Michigan, California, Pennsylvania, Washington, Florida and Louisiana — plus Washington, D.C., and the hospital associations in Illinois and a few other states.\n\nThey all told us the same thing: There hadn’t been any cases where their hospitals couldn’t provide ventilators to COVID-19 patients who needed them, or they weren’t aware of any.\n\nA patient is attached to a ventilator in the emergency room on April 20, 2020, at St. Joseph's Hospital in Yonkers, New York. (AP/Minchillo)\n\nA number of states are publicly tracking how many available ventilators they have in reserve, and some said they’ve transferred ventilators between hospitals to meet the need.\n\nAs of April 23, there were nearly 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in New Jersey, for example, but less than half of the state’s available ventilators were in use. The same could be said for Illinois and Louisiana, among several other states.\n\nThat doesn’t guarantee that nobody has been turned away from or kicked off a ventilator.\n\n\"I would not be surprised if we find out later that some tragic triage choices had to be made,\" said Eric Toner, a senior scholar of internal and emergency medicine at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"I would also note that the pandemic is not over and that many small communities with very limited critical care resources have yet to feel the impact.\"\n\nBut we found little evidence to suggest that hospitals haven’t been able to match the need for ventilators so far. We searched Google and Nexis news archives and found no major reports of patients dying for lack of a ventilator or because they were stiffed by a hospital for asking.\n\nSeveral states credited social distancing, statewide shelter-in-place policies and other mitigation efforts aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus with keeping their hospitals from being overwhelmed with patients or burning through their ventilators.\n\n\"All those measures are helping, and they’re why we didn’t run out of ventilators,\" said Matthew Wynia, director of the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado.\n\nThere were some 160,000 ventilators between hospitals and the federal stockpile as of March, and researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security had estimated in 2018 that a severe pandemic like the 1918 flu would put roughly 742,500 people in need of ventilation.\n\nVentilator production has ramped up since, with major manufacturers like Ford and General Motors chipping in to make more as governors buy them up. In a recent press conference, Trump said the U.S. is on pace to manufacture 150,000 new ventilators in 2020.\n\nVice President Mike Pence visits the GE Healthcare manufacturing facility on April 21, 2020, in Madison, Wisconsin. (AP/Gash)\n\nThe pandemic has also inspired a wide range of new innovations, with researchers creating new \"bridge ventilators\" for less critically ill patients and retrofitting other machines, such as those used by people with sleep apnea, for coronavirus purposes, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe White House recently set up the \"Dynamic Ventilator Reserve\" to let hospitals with extra ventilators loan them to more hard-hit areas. Separately, some states had already been passing ventilators around to others that needed them more urgently.\n\nThere’s still a lot we don’t know\n\nIn many places, hospitals prepared for the worst. Many states developed triage plans that were never formally activated.\n\nIn New York, the nation’s hardest-hit state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo authorized hospitals to hook two patients up to the same ventilator, a practice that medical groups opposed but at least one health system in New York wound up testing.\n\nOn April 6, Cuomo said the state had not \"lost anyone because we didn't have a bed or we didn't have a ventilator.\"\n\nOfficials at the hospital that experimented with ventilator splitting told the New York Times that they hadn’t run out of ventilators but were testing the method in case they needed it to manage a future spike in cases.\n\nBut Wynia said the application of some practices reserved for crisis situations could mean that we’ll one day discover some cases in which ventilator access was not so perfect.\n\nSometimes, he said, crises can lead doctors to be \"a little more coercive in conversations with patients’ families about when to not move forward with ventilation.\"\n\n\"When you’re putting more than one person on a ventilator, as they apparently have done a couple of times in New York, obviously that’s not normal,\" he said. \"That is a crisis.\"\n\nIn the future, we could also learn about likely-infected people who died at home after being denied a COVID-19 test and never making it back to the hospital, or patients who were critically ill with something other than the coronavirus and couldn’t get a ventilator for a procedure.\n\nIf you know someone who was denied access to a ventilator and needed one, please email us at [email protected]", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Did you know?

There is no communal angle at all,” further informing that the victim and the accused belong to the same community.

It was out of sudden provocation not because he burst crackers.” The officer stated that the two groups shared “past enmity” and a minor altercation led to the assault and subsequent death of the victim.\n\nIncidentally, most media reports gave the impression that Nayak was individually targetted.

Such protests swept across the U.S. after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man, while in the custody of a white police officer in Minneapolis.\n\nThe clip is genuine and comes from a 5 1/2-hour Facebook Live video streamed on Simone’s profile. The moment highlighted by Ngo, in which Simone appears to give a gun to a self-identified 18-year-old he does not appear to know, begins at around the 2:08:00 mark. While the CHOP has no formal leader, Simone has been active in “security” operations and in mediating discussions between protesters and the city. Simone’s livestreamed videos from the CHOP have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. In those videos, he can be seen speaking to crowds, to individual protesters, and to city personnel.\n\nAlthough it was shared on June 15, 2020, the video Ngo tweeted took place on the night of June 8, 2020, which was the first night of the CHOP protest. The day before, Nikolas Fernandez drove toward a crowd of protesters and shot one in the arm before fleeing toward the police. That evening, police cleared the protest, which had been blocked from progressing past the Seattle Police East Precinct, using flash bombs and chemical irritants. The next day, with tensions heightened, police removed barriers that had blocked protesters from the East Precinct, secured the building, and gradually removed officers from the area. As described in The Stranger, an alternative bi-weekly newspaper, protesters took the opportunity to occupy the area abandoned by police:\n\nFor several minutes, others in the crowd moseyed around in the intersection, wondering what to do next. Suspicion understandably reigned. Why did the cops decide to pack up their shit and abandon their post? Were they trying to set up the protesters, expecting them to burn the place down to prove a point? Organizers first gathered people to the center of the intersection on 12th and Pine and encouraged the crowd to keep the peace. … They drained water from water barriers and set up a perimeter one block in every direction from the station. Bicycle fencing, cement blocks, and cars formed street barricades. On 11th and Pine, a cardboard sign duct-taped to a barrier read, “You Are Entering Free Capitol Hill.\n\nThe move, according to an explanation from Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan five hours after the fact, was meant to “proactively de-escalate interactions between protestors and law enforcement outside the East Precinct.”\n\nBut the first night in “Free Capitol Hill,” while peaceful, was characterized by paranoia. In an unexpected development, protesters were now — in their eyes — responsible for their own security, and a rumor developed that members of the right-wing group Proud Boys were going to move into the protest area to set fires and stir chaos.\n\nSimone repeatedly refers to this rumor with other protesters in the five-hour long video shot that night, and the moment highlighted in the Ngo video stemmed from a (false) report of Proud Boys gathering at one of the barricades.\n\nIn sum, because the video is from Simone’s own Facebook Live stream, we rank the claim that a video shows him distributing a rifle from the trunk of his car as “True.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: In a move to de-escalate tensions, Chief Best and officers have removed barricades and secured the East Precinct amid CHOP protests.\nRewritten Tweet 2: Unbelievable! 😱 Chief Best and the police have reportedly removed barricades around the East Precinct in an effort to reduce tensions with protestors.\nRewritten Tweet 3: It is believed that Chief Best and the police might have taken down barricades near the East Precinct to calm the situation during CHOP protests.\nRewritten Tweet 4: Did you know? 🚨 To de-escalate interactions, Chief Best and officers have taken down barriers surrounding the East Precinct and secured the area.\nRewritten Tweet 5: Apparently, Chief Best and the officers have removed barricades at the East Precinct as a proactive step to ease tensions with CHOP protestors."}

Also, by the standards of one key government database, the U.S. had eight — not zero — school shootings in March 2020.\n\nAccording to one government database, the U.S. has had at least one shooting on K-12 school properties every March from 2003 through 2009, and every March since (but not including) 2010.\n\nTo prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, state leaders across the U.S. ordered widespread school closures in March 2020. In the weeks that followed, millions of students spent their days at home instead of in classrooms. Some teachers and staff moved lessons online, and administrators locked the doors to school buildings so the general public could not enter.\n\nThe closures were among the most dramatic steps by state leaders to combat the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 58,300 people globally as of this writing in mid-April 2020. About 56.6 million students registered for elementary or secondary school classes in the U.S. at the start of the 2019-20 academic year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nWhile a disruption to students’ learning, the shutdowns in America may have provided an unintended benefit, beyond limiting people’s exposure to the virus. On April 13, 2020, a journalist tweeted to his some 49,600 followers: “Last month was the first March without a school shooting in the United States since 2002.”\n\nThe reporter, Robert Klemko, quickly gained Twitter popularity among Americans who believe federal and state leaders should enact stricter gun laws, including former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “It shouldn’t have taken a pandemic to make this possible,” her Twitter account wrote in a retweet of Klemko’s post.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook users shared screenshots of Klemko’s tweet, and one Instagram account for a website that brands itself as a fact-checking service on that platform posted a photograph of a law-enforcement officer monitoring students boarding a school bus with Klemko’s claim as overlay text. Among media sites, CBS News published a story stating the assertion as fact.\n\n“My teens said this is the first time they have relaxed. No need to be hyper vigilant of every unusual sound, can just focus on school work,” one person tweeted. “Both grew up with regular Active Shooter Drills since kindergarten.”\n\nThe claim about school shootings since 2002 is twofold: It asserts that no school shootings occurred in the U.S. in March 2020 and that every March between 2003 and 2019 documented at least one such incident. But because agencies across government and the news media do not share a consistent way for tracking and defining school shootings, the truth of both assertions depends on whom you ask.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service and FBI, for example, provide an explanation of factors that contribute to school shootings but do not keep a running list of all on-campus gun crimes. Academics and school officials often rely on news media reports for their research, though journalists may not cover every shooting.\n\nThe nation’s biggest guns-rights group, the National Rifle Association, does not publish a running tally of shootings in schools, yet it has convened researchers to compile recommendations on how to avoid such incidents, like other organizations. Meanwhile, a leading opponent of the NRA — the lobbyist group Everytown for Gun Safety — has tracked all “incidents of gunfire” in K-12 schools and colleges, including suicides; shootings in which no one suffered injuries; and cases where the victims or gunmen may not have any connection to the school, since 2013.\n\nThose prominent advocacy groups aside, the least partisan and most comprehensive source of school-shooting data appears to be the “K-12 School Shooting Database” sponsored by the U.S. Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Updated daily by emergency-management researchers, the database records “each and every instance in which a gun is brandished, fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time of day, or day of week,” according to its stated methodology. Its website summarizes the tricky situation analyzing school-shooting data as follows:\n\nWith that as background, administrators of the CHDS-sponsored K-12 database documented eight incidents fitting its definition of a “school shooting” in March 2020. Local news media reports affirm those findings. The incidents include:\n• A shooting inside a Texas high school on March 2. According to , authorities arrested a 17-year-old student on suspicion of “accidentally” firing a gun during morning class. No one was injured.\n• A shooting at a Florida K-12 private school on March 5. A security guard at the school allegedly shot another staff member in the face while showing off his gun, according to . The victim sought medical help.\n• A shooting in Pennsylvania on March 10 in which a gunman opened fire at school bus carrying elementary students. Per , the bus was driving to school when a bullet “went through one window and exited out the other side”. No one was injured.\n• A incident on March 13 in which a security officer at a Tennessee elementary school discharged his gun inside his office. No one was struck. ( .)\n• The fatal shooting of a 19-year old man on a Texas high school football field on March 15. He was a former student of the high school. ( .)\n• A shooting on March 18 in the parking lot of a Louisiana high school that injured a 15-year-old male student. ( .)\n• A shooting on March 24 in the parking lot of a Louisiana elementary school that wounded a man. ( .)\n• A shooting on March 30 in the parking lot of a Georgia elementary school that injured three people. According to , the victims sought medical help.\n\nRegarding the claim that March 2020 was the first March without a school shooting since 2002, the data is more murky. The CHDS-sponsored database lists at least one incident in U.S. K-12 schools in March of every year from 2003 through 2009, and every year from 2011 through 2020, but none in 2010. Supporting that finding, tallies of K-12 school shootings by the for-profit National School Safety and Security Services consulting firm and the advocacy group the National School Safety Center do not show a March 2010 incident.\n\nHowever, those sources only consider shootings on U.S. elementary, middle and high school properties. If you expand the scope of research to also include shootings on college campuses, Ohio State University documented a deadly shooting on March 9, 2010. According to the New York Times’ coverage of the incident, officials said a custodian of the school shot and killed a co-worker before killing himself in a maintenance building. Another person was wounded in the gunfire.\n\nWe reached out to Washington Post reporter Klemko — the author of the viral claim — to understand where he got his numbers. He said he did include cases involving post-secondary institutions, rather than only focusing on K-12 schools.\n\nBut unlike other datasets, he said he only considered shootings in which students, teachers, or staff were the targets of the gunfire or the perpetrators. In other words, he said he did not consider cases where people trespassed on school property and opened fire at other people who aren’t part of the school community. He also did not consider cases in which persons (no matter their affiliation with the school) accidentally discharged a gun or shootings on school properties outside of school hours or on weekends.\n\n“I used shootings on school property, k-12, vocational schools, colleges and universities, where students or staff were intentionally shot at, or doing the shooting,” he wrote in an email. “Where government and private data were inconclusive, news reports filled the gaps.”\n\nLooking at the comprehensive standards by which the CHDS-sponsored database documents shootings, he said “it’s a mistake” to consider the database’s definition of a “school shooting” as the most fair. “Few Americans would agree, for example, that an incident where a safety officer accidentally fires a gun in an office, injuring no one, constitutes a school shooting,” he said. “Likewise, few would agree that adults trespassing on school grounds and exchanging gunfire when school is not in session and no children are present, is a school shooting.”\n\nIn sum, given the absence of a universal definition of “school shooting” in the U.S., and given that a government database and news media reports show at least eight shootings did occur on school properties in March 2020, we rate this claim as “Mostly False”.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Unbelievable! 😱 It took a pandemic to see a March without 'school shootings' in the traditional sense since 2002!\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Isn't it shocking that only during a pandemic did we see what some define as zero school shootings in March?!\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Some reports suggest that March 2020 was the first month in years without a traditional school shooting.

I think twit deleted.", "target": "Hours after former President Pranab Mukherjee addressed RSS cadres at an event in Nagpur, a photograph began circulating on social media in the late hours of June 7. It was alleged that BJP and RSS, sniffing an opportunity, had in an organised campaign, photoshopped an image of Mukherjee of the event.\n\nThe above tweet is by Ruchi Sharma who is a Congress leader and the IT cell incharge of the party for Haryana. Sharma had tagged Sharmistha Mukherjee, daughter of Pranab Mukherjee in this tweet. Sharmistha Mukherjee had, prior to the event, expressed consternation over her father’s decision to attend it. She referred to this tweet by Sharma in a tweet she posted at 11:03 pm on June 7.\n\nAs can be seen in the two images posted in the tweet above, the picture on the left is the actual picture, whereas the one on the right has been photoshopped. The trademark RSS cap which is part of the organisation’s official attire has been added to Mukherjee’s head and a hand has been added to the frame to show him doing the traditional RSS salutation.\n\nThese two juxtaposed images have been posted by Congress leaders and supporters on Twitter, reiterating that this kind of mischief by the sangh is exactly what had been feared.\n\nThe photograph was also added to an article written by suspended Congress leader Manishankar Aiyar and published on the website of NDTV. This was pointed out by a Twitter user.\n\nNDTV promptly took the picture down and apologised for the error. Suparna Singh, CEO of NDTV in a conversation with Alt News said, “NDTV ran a story on the morphed photo. The inauthentic photo was accidentally used for half an hour this morning in an opinion piece by Mani Shankar Aiyar. We apologize for the error.” Meanwhile, the RSS in a press release strongly condemned the photoshopped image, calling it a ‘dirty trick by divisive political forces’ which are out to malign the organisation.\n\nWhat is the source of this photoshopped image?\n\nAlt News was alerted by a social media user about the possible source of the photograph. According to this user, it was first tweeted by one Mihir Jha.\n\nAlt News checked the Twitter account of Mihir Jha, and found that his profile has restricted access. Jha in his ‘Bio’ section mentions “Proud to be followed by PM @narendramodi”. Using the exact text provided in the screenshot sent to us, we found the link to the tweet. On clicking the link, we found that the tweet has been deleted. We accessed the cached version of the deleted tweet and managed to obtain a screenshot of the same.\n\nThe time shown in this tweet is 7:07 am. This is because of a timezone difference as the tweet was probably cached from a server which resides in the Pacific Time Zone (California, USA) which is 12 and a half hours behind Indian Standard Time. To determine the exact time of the tweet we looked at the source code of the tweet to find the unix time of the tweet. Unix time is the number of seconds elapsed since 1 January 1970. The epoch time for the tweet by Jha is 1528380453 as can be seen in the screenshot below.\n\nUnix time 1528380453 converted to Indian Standard Time is 7:37 pm on June 7th. Jha’s tweet was therefore posted at 7:37 pm.\n\nInterestingly, only 23 minutes before this image was tweeted, i.e. at 7:14 pm IST, Jha had tagged another user @atheistkrishna in a tweet in which he posted the original photograph. Jha had tweeted to @Atheist_Krishna “Can u put one black cap on his head and change hand gestures? Asking for a friend from Congress IT Cell”. @Atheist_Krishna is followed on Twitter by BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya.\n\nOne Abhi Jha (@DarrKeAage) replied to the tweet with the now infamous photoshopped image.\n\nThe account @DarrKeAage no longer exists on Twitter. It has been deleted.\n\nOn the evening of June 8, India Today had reported that Mihir K Jha is the man who is behind the photoshopped picture of Pranab Mukherjee.\n\nIn most such cases where the Congress party and/or its leaders are targeted, Alt News has observed that such photoshopped images are circulated widely in an organised manner through a number of Twitter accounts and hundreds of pages on Facebook that are followed by millions of members. The right-wing ecosystem on social media is formidable, and operates in a synchronised manner to generate trends. It is this ecosystem that is often referred to as the dirty tricks department of the RSS and BJP.\n\nIn this particular instance, Alt News found that the pages and accounts which Alt News has tracked for regularly posting misinformation had not shared this photoshopped image. However, evidence points to Mihir K Jha being the first to refer to tampering of the photograph and subsequently posting it on Twitter. It may be reiterated that Jha is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter.", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request."}

Sign and stand in support:-STAFF", "target": "In Scott Walker and Hillary Clinton's perfect world, at around this time next year each will be preparing to participate in the 2016 presidential debates.\n\nFor now, they will have to be content exchanging jabs from afar.\n\nThe latest exchange began June 4, 2015 when Clinton, who is the leading Democratic presidential candidate, criticized Walker and three other GOP contenders in a speech at Texas Southern University in Houston for their support of voter ID laws. She claimed Walker had cut back early voting in Wisconsin and made it harder for college students to vote. We rated that Mostly True.\n\nWalker responded to Clinton’s attack with a statement and then through a series of tweets. In his statement, Walker said, \"Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans.\"\n\nIs Walker right that a strong majority of Americans support photo IDs to vote? And do those requirements make it \"easier to vote and harder to cheat\"?\n\nThe thrust of Walker’s claim was that photo ID laws are exceptionally popular among voters, and that Hillary Clinton’s view opposing them is out of step. So we will start there.\n\nAccording to the polls we examined, Walker is on target about public support.\n\nA Rasmussen Reports poll published June 3, 2015, showed 76 percent of respondents believe voters should be required to show a form of photo identification before being allowed to vote. Even 58 percent of respondents who identified as Democrats supported voter ID laws. The poll included 952 likely voters and had a margin of error of 3 percent.\n\nA 2012 Washington Post poll found 74 percent of respondents said they believed voters should have to show government-issued ID before casting a ballot.\n\nAgain, the support crossed demographic groups: 78 percent of white respondents supported voter ID laws; as did 67 percent of non-whites, 65 percent of blacks and 64 percent of Hispanics. The poll included 2,047 adults. The margin of error was 2.5 percent.\n\nWe looked at several other national polls, and all had similar numbers: between 70 percent and 80 percent of voters support requiring a photo ID to vote.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2014 Marquette University Law School poll of 1,409 registered Wisconsin voters found 60 percent of respondents supported requiring a photo ID to vote. The margin of error was 2.7 percent.\n\n\"It gets overwhelming public support,\" said Kenneth Mayer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"Depending on which poll, you might get 60 to 80 percent support.\n\n\"The reason you get that level of support ... most of the people who vote have an accessible voter ID.\"\n\nThere are two other elements embedded in Walker’s claim -- that photo ID laws make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.\n\nOn these points, there is great partisan disagreement and dug-in views on both sides.\n\nCritics of ID laws -- mainly Democrats -- say the amount of voter fraud is small and that the laws can disenfranchise poor and elderly voters who may have difficulty obtaining a photo ID. Supporters note the law includes provisions to address access to IDs and argue that any amount of fraud is too much.\n\n\"It doesn’t matter if there’s one, 100 or 1,000,\" Walker said in a 2014 gubernatorial debate. \"Amongst us, who would be that one person who would like to have our vote canceled out by a vote that was cast illegally?\"\n\nIn 2011, Walker signed Act 23, the law that requires Wisconsin voters to present a form of photo ID before receiving a ballot. Provisions of the law were quickly challenged in court.\n\nThus the law has only fully in place been for the 2012 spring primary -- a nonpartisan contest that had only eight judicial races on the ballot, plus three local special elections. It has yet to be tested in a statewide race.\n\nThat will change in 2016, with the spring elections. In March 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to the law, meaning it now stands.\n\nBefore the 2011 legislation, an already-registered voter had to simply state his or her name and address to a poll worker in order to receive a ballot. Under the new law, a voter must also show an acceptable form of photo ID and sign the poll book before receiving a ballot.\n\nWhen asked for evidence that photo ID laws make it easier to vote, a Walker aide pointed to a modest increase in voter turnout in Wisconsin since the law was passed.\n\nBut that ignores the many other factors at play in driving turnout, including the candidates on the ballot and how close the race is perceived to be by voters. And, as noted, the law has not yet been fully in place for a statewide election, so to say it increased turnout is a stretch at best.\n\nIndeed, some studies, such as one from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, suggest photo ID laws may have contributed to a decrease in voter turnout in some states.\n\nIn 2012, more than 9 in 10 registered Wisconsin voters were estimated to have a valid form of photo ID. That left around 300,000 registered voters without a photo ID at the time. Mayer, who conducted the estimate, said it is unknown how many unregistered voters may lack the proper documents to obtain a free, state-issued ID.\n\nThe bottom line: At least some voters will have to go to extra steps to obtain a valid ID. That makes it more difficult to vote, not easier.\n\nAs for the \"harder to cheat\" portion, Mayer conceded photo ID laws could be effective against in-person voter fraud. But he and others note that there have been few documented cases of in-person voter fraud.\n\n\"It makes it harder for kangaroos to vote, but kangaroo voter fraud is not a problem,\" Mayer said.\n\nThat argument, though, goes to the whether the law itself was even needed. Walker’s claim was on the impact of the changes. The new law adds an extra verification step at the polling place before votes can be cast. That clearly makes it harder to cheat, as Walker claimed.\n\nWhen it comes to voter fraud, the most common type is voting by felons who are not allowed to vote, said Reid Magney, a public information officer for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board.\n\nA felon is not allowed to vote if he or she is still \"on-paper,\" meaning he or she is on parole, on extended supervision or on probation. Once a felon is \"off-paper\" he or she can vote again after re-registering.\n\nFelon voting has been a problem before in Milwaukee. A Journal Sentinel investigation from 2008 identified \"at least 278 cases where felons may have improperly voted.\"\n\nBut voter ID laws would not prevent this type of voter fraud; many felons can still get driver's licenses. The state catches illegal felon voters by cross referencing a list of voters to a list of felons \"on paper\" with the Department of Corrections.\n\nWalker said, \"Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans.\"\n\nWalker is on point with the main thrust of his claim. Polls show strong support for voter ID laws, including from Democrats.\n\nThe other elements of the claim -- easier to vote and harder to cheat -- amount to a split. It’s clearly not easier to vote if the extra step of obtaining a photo ID is added. Likewise, it is harder to cheat if there is an extra verification step at the polling place.\n\nOn balance, we rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Wisconsin's voter ID law faces serious challenges! 🚨 Show your support by signing! -STAFF\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Unbelievable!

Therefore, concerns about the Nov. 3, 2020, election being tampered with due to envelope labels are unfounded. Tampering with mail-in ballots is a federal crime, and the election supervisor's office in Palm Beach County hasn't received any such reports.\n\nMail-in ballots for primary elections in Palm Beach County, Florida, do contain labels on envelopes indicating whether the voter is receiving a Democratic or Republican ballot.\n\nDuring August 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a Facebook post in which a Florida woman described on video her alarm at discovering the letters “D” and “R” displayed on mail-in ballot envelopes sent to her and her brother, who live at the same address.\n\nThe video was posted on Facebook by a Palm Beach County resident identified by local media as Tina Brown. It had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, and it was even retweeted by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nIn the video, which lasted about two minutes, Brown pointed to a series of letters and numbers under the bar code on mail-in ballots sent to her, a registered Republican, and her brother, a registered Democrat, noting that on her envelope the series contains the letter “R,” while her brother’s contains the letter “D.”\n\n“So a postal person could see this, if they’re a Democrat, and say, ‘oh, that’s an R. Let’s toss it, let’s just chuck it,” Brown stated in the video. She then added, “It is very important that we take these [ballots] and bring it to the voting places, and vote by person. Do not vote by mail. I’m telling you guys, you need to listen to this, OK, please be wary, alright.”\n\nHere’s the Twitter post that included the video, which was retweeted by Trump:\n\nThe post likely attracted widespread attention because Trump had been making inaccurate statements casting doubt on the security of voting by mail, a process that would play a big role in the November 2020 general election due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhat was seen in the video — ballot envelopes with the letters “R” and “D” in their bar codes — was real. However, the commentary in the video was missing context, thus creating unnecessary anxiety about the labeling.\n\nAfter the video went viral, Wendy Sartory Link, supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, took to Twitter to explain why the political party-affiliated letters were present on the ballot envelopes.\n\nThe codes were there, she said, because Florida is one of nine states that holds closed primaries, meaning only people registered as Democrats or Republicans can vote in that state’s primary elections, and the ballots for each party are different. Furthermore, Link added, tampering with mail is a federal crime, and as of this writing, her office hasn’t received any reports of such tampering:\n\nIt’s true that the letters “R” and “D” are on the outside of mail-in ballot envelopes that Brown and her brother received. However, those labels are only present on primary election ballots when registered Republican and Democratic voters receive different ballots in partisan elections. The labels are not present on general election ballot envelopes.\n\nFurthermore, the likelihood that ballots would be tampered with by Postal Service workers is highly unlikely. Andrea Avery, a spokesperson for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, pointed out in an email to Snopes that all mail is “protected by more than 200 federal laws enforced by the United States Postal Inspection Service, one of the nation’s oldest federal law enforcement agencies.” Avery said:\n\nA statement posted by the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections office noted that voters who cast ballots by mail can track their votes on the office’s website.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Voter ballots reportedly have party labels, but there's no indication of tampering—it's a federal crime, and no reports have surfaced yet.\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you know? 🗳️ Mail-in ballots show party affiliation, yet no tampering incidents reported—it's a federal offense!\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Concerns about mail-in ballot tampering are believed to be unfounded; no reports have indicated any such activity.\"\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Voting by mail faces scrutiny over political labels on ballot envelopes, but federal crime laws deter any tampering, and no such cases have been reported.\"\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Breaking news: Mail-in ballots in primaries show party labels, but despite fears, no tampering has been reported—protected by federal law.\""}

Today atI called on the Senate to stand with the 90 percent of Americans who support background checks and take action on gun violence.", "target": "In remarks during a visit to a Chicago hospital, Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin said President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are standing in the way of efforts on Capitol Hill to address gun violence despite widespread public support.\n\nTrump and McConnell, he contended, have stonewalled efforts to expand background check requirements via bipartisan legislation that cleared the Democrat-controlled House more than 200 days ago. Current federal law requires background checks for sales by licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers; the House bill would require background checks for all firearm purchases.\n\n\"Background checks just make sense,\" Durbin said. \"Turns out that 90% of policemen are for it, 90% of gun owners are for it, the overwhelming majority of members of the National Rifle Association are for it. And yet this president and the leader of the Senate refuse to act.\"\n\nPolitiFact has previously checked claims about broad support for expanded background checks among the general public, along with statements that line up with what Durbin said about gun owners and members of the National Rifle Association widely backing them as well.\n\nBut his claim about support among law enforcement wasn’t one we’d heard before, so we decided to check it out.\n\nA spokesperson for Durbin’s office pointed us to results from a survey published in 2017 by Pew Research Center, a generally reliable source for data. Experts we contacted told us they were not aware of any more recent surveys on the topic.\n\nThat survey — conducted for Pew by the National Police Research Platform, a consortium of researchers headquartered at the University of Illinois at Chicago — found 88% of police support \"making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.\"\n\nThe margin of error for the question was plus or minus two percentage points, according to a Pew spokesperson.\n\nAs the survey’s detailed methodology section lays out, interviews were completed online during the summer of 2016 by nearly 8,000 officers from 54 police and sheriff’s departments across the country.\n\nExperts, including at Pew, explained there’s one caveat worth keeping in mind, though. The survey left out more rural, small-town police forces throughout the country: It provides a nationally representative sample of officers working in departments that employ at least 100 full-time sworn officers, but smaller departments were not included.\n\n\"While 88% appears to be a good estimate for this sampling frame, it may exclude a fraction of the nation’s officers who disproportionately hold more conservative views on gun control issues,\" said polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nHowever, Smith noted, a substantial majority of police nationwide likely work for departments of the size that were included.\n\nIndeed, 63% of all sworn officers work in departments of more than 100 officers, according to Pew. So the result still speaks for the majority.\n\nTo gain some insight into that position, we asked local law enforcement leaders why police are likely to support expanding background checks.\n\n\"Most of them want to protect the Constitution,\" said Frank Kaminski, police chief of Park Ridge, Ill. and a former president of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police. \"But they also see the violence in the streets every day and realize that we have to take common sense measures to reduce it.\"\n\n\"When we talk about violence, we talk about violence not only to citizens but also to officers,\" he added.\n\nWhile speaking about legislation that would expand background checks to all gun sales, Durbin said 90% of police back such a policy.\n\nHe was referencing a 2017 survey by Pew Research Center, which asked police at departments that employ 100 or more officers whether they support requiring background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows. Eighty-eight percent responded that they did.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that survey left out officers at smaller, more rural jurisdictions who may not share the same views, and we could not find any other recent polls that addressed the question.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE — The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Over 200 days have passed since the House pushed through a bipartisan background check bill, yet the Senate hasn’t voted on it.

Throughout the video, we can hear people scream in terror.\n\nA Twitter user posted the viral video and claimed it is from Uttar Pradesh. Alt News received an app request where it was suggested that the clip was shot in “Jalalpur Ambedkar Nagar”.\n\nA Facebook user shared the viral video along with Gujarati text, “Today in the skies of Iraq, strange structures were seen and people started crying for fear that this was the beginning of the end of the world!

This suggests that the voices of people panicking were superimposed to the clip.\n\nAccording to the title, the video shows a ‘mysterious planet Nibiru.’ However, this is not an actual event but related to a popular doomsday theory debunked by NASA in 2017.\n\nUsing InVid, a video verification tool, Alt News analysed the viral video by performing a reverse image search on Yandex. We found a 2018 report by Turn Back Hoax, an Indonesia-based fact-check platform.\n\nThe outlet debunked the video when several people claimed to post a ‘Facebook live’ of the event. As per Turn Back Hoax, the video was created using clips that already existed on the internet. “One of them is published in Youtube here: https://goo.gl/ebNMBm, about “Planet Nibiru” conspiracy theories,” reads the report. The YouTube video is however unavailable now.\n\nTurn Back Hoax also cites a 2017 article from The Telegraphwhich said, “Planet X, or Nibiru, refers to a mythological planet in our solar system that will supposedly crash into Earth and wipe out the human race, however it has been consistently dismissed by Nasa and other experts as an internet hoax.”\n\nNASA republished an article around the conspiracy theories in 2012. “The biggest missing link in the doomsday prophecy is Nibiru itself. Because no giant, rogue planet has been found in the outer solar system to play the role of Nibiru…” reads the article which also quotes NASA’s David Morrison: “The fact is that these folks are constantly changing their story. For some, Nibiru is no longer the Sumerian god or planet that is supposed to be returning to Earth in late 2012. It has become a catchword for almost any cosmic catastrophe.”\n\nTherefore, the claims that the viral video is from Iraq or shows a catastrophic planet is false.

Mia Love, whose family comes from Haiti, responds to President Trump's comments on Haiti and African nations, saying \"The President' comments are unkind, divisive, elitist, and fly in the face of our nation's values.\"Read more:", "target": "Prior to departing for visits to El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 7, President Donald Trump rejected the premise that his rhetoric has divided the country, as his critics have claimed. He said “my rhetoric … brings people together.” But that is not how he is perceived by most Americans.\n\nA CNN poll in March found that nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the phrase “will unite the country and not divide it” doesn’t apply to Trump. In a Pew Research Center survey published in June, 55% of those surveyed say Trump has changed the tone of political debate for the worse, while only 24% say he has changed it for the better.\n\nTrump’s rhetoric has brought some people together, as evidenced by the large and boisterous crowds that attend his political rallies, and he has high job approval ratings among Republicans. But he has a well-earned reputation for responding strongly to political attacks — real and perceived.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, his wife, Melania, said of her husband, “As you may know by now, when you attack him he will punch back 10 times harder.”\n\nTrump’s combative approach has continued throughout his presidency, and at times he has made divisive and disparaging remarks that in some cases have drawn criticism even from his own party.\n\nHere is just a sampling of some those moments:\n\nIn a series of tweets in July, Trump told “‘Progressive’ Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe,” to “go back” to those countries.\n\n“Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” Trump tweeted.\n\nHe was referring to Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar. Omar was born in Somalia, but the other three were born in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez was born in New York, Tlaib in Detroit and Pressley in Chicago.\n\nRepublican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, who recently announced he will not run for reelection, told CNN that Trump’s tweets were not only inaccurate, but “racist and xenophobic.”\n\nThe Democratic-led House adopted a resolution condemning Trump’s “racist comments.” Only four Republicans, including Hurd, voted for it, but at least 40 Republican members of Congress criticized the president’s remarks, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nA Fox News poll found that 63% of those surveyed thought that Trump’s tweets about the congresswomen “crossed the line,” and only 27% saw them as an “acceptable political attack.”\n\nFollowing his remarks, Trump’s supporters at a rally in North Carolina chanted, “Send her back,” as Trump relitigated his case against Omar. The president later falsely said he tried to stop the chant — a claim that resulted in four Pinocchios from the Washington Post fact checker.\n\nAlso in July, Trump attacked Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, and in the process declared that his district in Baltimore is uninhabitable for humans. He called the district “a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess” and claimed that “no human being would want to live there.”\n\nIn an interview with a local radio station, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, called Trump’s comments “outrageous and inappropriate.”\n\nBaltimore is not alone. Trump also has denigrated Atlanta and San Francisco, among others.\n\nA day after calling Baltimore uninhabitable, Trump tweeted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s district in San Francisco is “not even recognizeable lately,” saying “[s]omething must be done before it is too late.”\n\nShortly before his inauguration, Trump tweeted that Democratic Rep. John Lewis’ district, which includes Atlanta, is “in horrible shape and falling apart (and not to … mention crime infested).”\n\nTrump has often used the word “invasion” to describe the so-called caravans of Central Americans traveling to seek asylum in the U.S. and other immigrants who cross the border illegally. At a May 8 rally in Panama City, Florida, Trump defended his use of the word “invasion,” and expressed frustration at the inability to stem the flow of illegal immigration.\n\n“I mean, when you have 15,000 people marching up, and you have hundreds and hundreds of people, and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great – and don’t forget we don’t let them and we can’t let them use weapons,” Trump said. “We can’t. Other countries do, we can’t. I would never do that. But how do you stop these people?”\n\nAt this point, an audience member yelled, “Shoot them!”\n\nTrump shook his head and joked, “That’s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that stuff.”\n\nA frequent target of the president’s attacks are legal U.S. residents who have lawfully entered the country through the Diversity Immigration Visa Program.\n\nAs we have written before, the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program uses a computer lottery system to randomly issue up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year to qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.\n\nAt a Jan. 9, 2018, immigration meeting at the White House, Trump inaccurately described the program this way: “They call it ‘visa lottery,’ I just call it ‘lottery.’ But countries come in and they put names in a hopper. They’re not giving you their best names; common sense means they’re not giving you their best names. They’re giving you people that they don’t want. And then we take them out of the lottery. And when they do it by hand — where they put the hand in a bowl — they’re probably — what’s in their hand are the worst of the worst.”\n\nAs we have written, there is no evidence that other countries are gaming the system and sending the U.S. “the worst of the worst.” Individuals, not countries, apply for the visa, and applicants are subjected to the same background checks as other visa applicants, including criminal background checks.\n\nTrump made similar claims at a Dec. 8, 2017, rally in Florida, saying “when they pick the lottery, they have the real worst in their hands, oh, here they go.” On Feb. 13, 2018, at White House immigration meeting, Trump said “they’re not giving us their finest.” At an Aug. 2, 2018, rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed that a person who “killed nine people” could get a visa through the diversity program, even though there is a screening process that would specifically bar entry to a convicted killer.\n\nThe president regularly labels news stories he doesn’t like as “fake news,” even when they are accurate, and has called news organizations “the enemy of the people.” He first used the term “enemy of the American people” in a tweet on Feb. 17, 2017, less than a month into his presidency. A week later, in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump doubled down on the phrase, while making an inaccurate claim.\n\n“They are the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources, they just make ’em up when there are none,” he said. “I saw one story recently where they said, ‘Nine people have confirmed.’ There’re no nine people. I don’t believe there was one or two people.”\n\nAs we wrote at the time, the Washington Post on Feb. 9, 2017, broke the story that then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn “privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials.” The story — which cited “[n]ine current and former officials” as the sources — was accurate. Flynn later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about talking to the Russian ambassador about U.S. sanctions.\n\nIn a Jan. 17, 2018, speech on the Senate floor, then-Republican Sen. Jeff Flake criticized the president for an “unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press.” In particular, Flake was critical of the term “enemy of the people.”\n\n“‘The enemy of the people,’ was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017,” Flake said. “It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase ‘enemy of the people,’ that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader. This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party.”\n\nThe president has had a running feud with Puerto Rico and its leaders.\n\nLast September, Trump rejected Puerto Rico’s official estimate of 2,975 hurricane-related deaths after Hurricane Maria, tweeting that “3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico.” He said the death toll was “6 to 18 deaths,” and falsely claimed Democrats had produced the higher estimate “to make me look as bad as possible.”\n\nThen-Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who was running for Senate at the time, was among the Republicans who distanced themselves from Trump’s remarks. “I disagree with @POTUS,” Scott tweeted. “I’ve been to Puerto Rico 7 times & saw devastation firsthand. The loss of any life is tragic; the extent of lives lost as a result of Maria is heart wrenching. I’ll continue to help PR.”\n\nIn April, Trump complained about the amount of federal disaster aid for Puerto Rico, falsely claiming that “Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane” and that it received “more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before.”\n\nAt the White House last year, the president met with Democrats and Republicans to discuss a bipartisan plan to remove the threat of deportation for so-called dreamers — young people who were illegally brought to the United States as children.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin later quoted the president as saying of African nations, “‘Those shitholes send us the people that they don’t want.’ He repeated that. He didn’t say that just one time.” Durbin also quoted Trump as saying, “‘We don’t need more Haitians.’”\n\nAfter the meeting, Sen. Lindsey Graham reportedly told his fellow Republican senator from South Carolina, Tim Scott, that the media reports about Trump’s language at the meeting were “basically accurate,” according to Charleston’s Post and Courier.\n\nAs we wrote, Trump denied using those words, although he said in a tweet that he used “tough” language. “The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used,” Trump said, without explaining which remarks he denied making or what exactly he said at the meeting.\n\nWe don’t know what was said, but the incident drew national and international rebukes, including from Trump’s fellow Republicans. Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said Trump’s reported remarks, if true, were “incredibly disappointing.” In a statement, Rep. Mia Love, a Utah Republican whose parents came to the U.S. from Haiti, called them “divisive.”\n\n“The President'[s] comments are unkind, divisive, elitist, and fly in the face of our nation’s values,” Love wrote. “This behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation.”\n\nThese are just some examples.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” and as president ordered what he called a “travel ban” on the citizens of seven predominately Muslim countries (Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen). That policy and other remarks about Muslims have caused a rift with leaders in the Muslim-American community.\n\nHe has also feuded with professional football players who knelt during the national anthem, mocked the physical appearance of women who have criticized him, and belittled political opponents in both parties with derogatory nicknames.\n\nAfter saying that his rhetoric “brings people together,” Trump flew to Dayton, Ohio, and then El Paso, Texas, to comfort the victims of last week’s mass shootings and thank law enforcement. After the president’s visit, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said in a press conference that Trump was “received well by the patients” and “did the right things.”\n\nBut Brown also made statements at the press conference that angered Trump, and the president fired back. “I had it with Sherrod Brown,” Trump said.\n\nOn this day of unity, the president also went on Twitter to criticize “Sleepy Joe Biden,” who gave a speech on the danger that Trump’s “toxic tongue” poses to the nation; describe Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas as “the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate;” and assail Fox News reporter Shepard Smith for having “the lowest rated show on @FoxNews.”\n\nAs the first lady said, the president doesn’t back down from a fight.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking: Rep.

The clip was a video report, supposedly broadcast by Aaj Tak.\n\nAlt News confirmed that Aaj Tak had indeed broadcast a report on the incident in its morning bulletin. The video clip of the report is posted below.\n\nThe report states that Shadab (Abu Kamil), who runs a coaching centre in Patna, was forced into a car when he was on his way to Hajipur. He was robbed and beaten up and then thrown out of the car. When the people of the nearby village saw Shadab lying injured on the ground, instead of helping him, mistook him for a thief and thrashed him. Police later came to know of the incident, rescued him and admitted him to the hospital. The report was filed from Vaishali.\n\nThis is the only media related information about the incident which Alt News could find. There are no other news reports of the incident.\n\nTo ascertain the veracity of the incident and discover the facts of the case, Alt News contacted Sarai police station, which confirmed, “Yes, this incident did take place. The victim had been thrown out of a vehicle, after which he was wandering in a helpless state. Some people from the village nearby gathered around him and in an act of mischief, branded him a thief and started thrashing him. A FIR has been filed in the case and two people have been arrested in the case.” (translated from Hindi).\n\nRubbishing the claim that the person was beaten up because he had sexually assaulted a girl, the police said, “Nothing of that sort had happened. He was beaten up as he was in a disoriented state and was branded a thief by some villagers.”, adding that the claim that the victim was beaten up by members of his own community, is false. Moreover, police confirmed that the image circulating on social media is indeed that of the mob assault victim.\n\nPrashant Patel Umrao and ShankhNaad’s narrative of the incident is false. The victim had not committed sexual assault, as claimed. Also, he was not beaten up by members of his own community.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Shadab, a coaching institute owner in Patna, was brutally beaten by confused villagers in Hajipur after being thrown from a car by unknown attackers—mistaken identity at its worst! 😟\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Unbelievable violence in Hajipur!

Why? In part because \"only a small number of players decided to come,\" and in part because Trump said that players had been kneeling or standing in the locker room during the national anthem, which he said was \"disrespectful.\" Many people on the internet made the reasonable assumption that Trump was talking about Eagles players.\n\nBut here’s the thing: none of the Eagles kneeled during the national anthem in 2017. According to a study released by Sports Pundit, the Birds were one of just seven teams in the NFL with a perfect non-kneeling record for the entire year. And they didn’t wait in the locker room either, per ESPN SportsCenter anchor Kevin Negandhi. We found no reports that said players stayed in the locker room.\n\nThe only on-field activism displayed by some Eagles players was the raising of their fists during the national anthem, which was kickstarted by safety Malcolm Jenkins.\n\nThere’s one tiny exception: cornerback Ron Brooks kneeled once, but he was cut before the season started.\n\nThe movement among NFL players to kneel during the national anthem began back in 2016, when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the 2016 preseason to protest police brutality and racial inequality.\n\nAnd other players followed suit. A record number of players kneeled during Week 3 of the 2017 season, after President Donald Trump stated that players who did so should be fired.\n\nLast month, NFL owners unanimously approved a new policy that would require players to stand if they are on the field during the national anthem, and slap teams with a fine if they disobey. Under the new rule, players would still be able to wait in the locker room during the anthem.\n\nIn its reporting on Monday night, Fox News circulated images of a handful of Eagles kneelingbefore games, implying they did so in protest. Players jumped to defend themselves, saying the photos of them kneeling were actually moments of prayer, not protest.\n\nExecutive Producer Chris Wallace later apologized for the \"misleading\" footage.\n\nThe Eagles released their own statement — basically a subtweet of the President that didn’t acknowledge the issues at all.\n\nPennsylvania politicians have since jumped in on the action. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney called Trump a \"fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one will attend.\" Yeesh. So that’s what happens when you insult Kenney’s hometown team.\n\nSenator Bob Casey said he still supports the Birds, and he invited players to celebrate at the state Capitol. U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle echoed that sentiment, welcoming the team to Harrisburg for Wawa coffee (on him).\n\nTrump said he canceled the Eagles’ visit to the White House in part because some players declined to attend, and in part because \"staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling.\"\n\nBut according to a study from Sports Pundit, there were zero Eagles players who kneeled during the national anthem during the 2017 season. And according to ESPN SportsCenter anchor Kevin Negandhi, they didn’t wait in the locker room either.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Eagles players, known for their incredible community contributions, had their White House visit canceled last minute, despite their non-kneeling stance in 2017! 🦅\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"The Eagles, who consistently support vital causes, faced an abrupt uninvitation from the White House, although none kneeled during the anthem in 2017.\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Despite being a team that actively engages in meaningful community efforts, the Eagles were disinvited from the White House, with no players kneeling in 2017!\"\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Eagles, hailed for their dedication to important causes, didn’t kneel during the national anthem in 2017, yet faced a canceled White House trip.\"\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"The Eagles, known for standing for meaningful causes, had their White House visit scrapped, even though none kneeled or stayed in the locker room in 2017!\""}
{"query_id": 1.2162520855174062e+18, "query": "9. I've gone through some of the most active and prominent liberal Twitter accounts and none of them mentioned the Iran protests today. These same people were actively tweeting about wanting to avoid war and attacking Trump for his decision.What happened?", "target": "Social media posts make a broad and misleading claim that “Democrats stood with” the leaders of Venezuela, China and Iran rather than supporting oppressed people in those countries. The facts don’t support that generalization.\n\nDubious viral posts on Facebook accuse Democrats of supporting repressive regimes around the world and argue that President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has “stood with” the people of those countries.\n\nThe claim, first spread by a pro-Trump Twitter user, feeds into and expands upon the erroneous narrative spread in recent weeks that Democrats have “mourned” the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike on Jan. 2.\n\n“Trump stood with the people of Venezuela. Democrats stood with Maduro. Trump stood with the protesters in Hong Kong. Democrats stood with Communist China. Trump stands with the people of Iran. Democrats stand with Soleimani and the Ayatollahs,” the posts read. “Notice the pattern yet?”\n\nBut that broad assertion doesn’t hold up after a review of public statements and legislative actions by Democrats on the national stage. We’ll go through each component of the claim here.\n\nEarly last year, Trump said the U.S. would officially recognize Venezuela’s National Assembly president, Juan Guaidó, as the country’s interim president — rather than Venezuela’s president since 2013, Nicolás Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was widely considered illegitimate by other countries, including the U.S. Venezuela has endured a collapsing economy and human rights groups have said medicine and food shortages constitute a “humanitarian emergency.”\n\nEfforts by opposition forces, with U.S. support, to oust Maduro in 2019 were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nBut it’s baseless to say that “Democrats” — which implies most, if not all — “stood with Maduro.”\n\nDemocratic leaders in Congress — including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — issued statements supporting the recognition of Guaidó as interim president and rebuking Maduro.\n\n“The United States must respect legitimate democratic processes, and support the right of the people of Venezuela to protest and defend their human rights,” Pelosi said. “Nicolas Maduro’s regime of repression and impoverishment for his personal enrichment continues to gravely violate human rights, and must be condemned swiftly by the full international community.”\n\nA handful of Democrats in Congress did express opposition to a U.S.-forced regime change in Venezuela, and instead endorsed peace negotiations facilitated by other countries and the Vatican. But even one of those lawmakers, Rep. Ilhan Omar, wrote that “No one is defending Maduro.” She later said, “Opposition to intervention ≠ support for a country’s leader.”\n\nIn February, Democrats in Florida criticized presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders for not explicitly calling Maduro a dictator and recognizing Guaidó. But when the Council on Foreign Relations surveyed 18 Democrats running for president last year on the issue of Venezuela, including Sanders, none offered statements of support for Maduro.\n\nInstead, almost all explicitly condemned Maduro, supported Guaidó, or did both.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden called Maduro “a tyrant, who has stolen elections, abused his authority, allowed his cronies to enrich themselves, and denied the delivery of food and medicine to the people he claims to lead.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Maduro is “a dictator and a crook who has wrecked his country’s economy, dismantled its democratic institutions, and profited while his people suffer.”\n\nMany of the candidates called for the U.S. to assist Venezuelans, who were fleeing the country by the millions. And some of the candidates expressed reluctance for the U.S. to become entangled in regime change.\n\nThe few who were less explicit in their criticism of Maduro largely cautioned the U.S. to not become involved militarily, or engage in tactics that could potentially be harmful to Venezuelans.\n\nSanders, for example, said his “administration would support the negotiations between the Maduro government and the opposition, and work with other countries in our region, and the international community, to support the Venezuelan people’s right to build their own future.” He said he “would condemn the use of violence against unarmed protesters and the suppression of dissent” and “listen to the voices of Venezuelan activists themselves who warn against broad sanctions, such as the Trump administration’s oil sanctions, that mainly punish the people, not the government.”\n\nSanders has more recently referred to Maduro as a “vicious tyrant.”\n\nDemonstrators have taken to the streets in Hong Kong since the of summer 2019 to protest against a (now-scrapped) proposed bill that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to China. Pro-democracy protesters also demanded changes to Hong Kong’s election process, including the direct election of the city’s chief executive, who is selected by a 1,200-member committee.\n\nDuring the December Democratic presidential debate, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has repeatedly expressed support for the protests, accused Trump of not making “a peep” in support of “folks out there standing up for democracy” in Hong Kong.\n\nAs we wrote at the time, Buttigieg’s claim about Trump wasn’t accurate; the president had signed two bills supporting Hong Kong protesters despite objections by the Chinese government.\n\nHowever, those two bills got to the president’s desk with the help of most congressional Democrats.\n\nThe first bill — S. 1838, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 — requires the U.S. to annually “assess whether political developments in Hong Kong justify changing Hong Kong’s unique treatment under U.S. law,” including not being subject to tariffs levied upon China. It also features some human rights provisions.\n\nThat bill was sponsored by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and passed by unanimous consent in the Republican-controlled Senate. It was then approved by the Democrat-controlled House. While a few representatives from both parties did not vote, the only member of the House who voted against it was Rep. Thomas Massie — a Republican.\n\nThe second bill, S. 2710, was sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley and prohibits the sale of “specified munitions,” including tear gas, rubber bullets and handcuffs, to the Hong Kong Police Force. The bill was approved in both chambers and there were no votes against it.\n\nPelosi and a bipartisan group of lawmakers also hosted pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong at the U.S. Capitol in September.\n\nAnd in addition to Buttigieg, other Democratic presidential candidates still in the race — such as Biden, Warren, Sanders and Sen. Amy Klobuchar — have publicly supported the protesters, too.\n\nAfter the Jan. 2 killing of Soleimani, many leading Democrats criticized or questioned Trump’s decision to order the airstrike on the Iranian military leader. Pelosi referred to the move as “provocative and disproportionate.”\n\nBut as we’ve written, the House speaker didn’t “defend” Soleimani, as the president claimed. And, as PolitiFact found, it’s also not the case that top Democrats were “mourning” his death.\n\nInstead, many have acknowledged his acts of terror — the Pentagon has attributed the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members to Soleimani, and said he was planning future attacks — even when criticizing or questioning Trump’s decision to have him killed.\n\nFor example, while Schumer said the Trump administration’s “lack of advance of consultation and transparency with Congress can lead to hasty and ill-considered decisions,” he also said Soleimani was a “notorious terrorist” and that “no one should shed a tear over his death.”\n\nDays after Soleimani was killed, Iran shot down a Ukrainian passenger airplane, killing 176 people. After Iran initially denied responsibility, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani then blamed human error and said the plane was accidentally shot down — a revelation that prompted Iranians to take to the streets to protest the Iranian government.\n\nTrump publicly supported those protesters, warning Iran in a tweet that “the World is watching.”\n\nWhile some prominent Democrats — including 2020 candidates Biden, Warren and Klobuchar — posted messages supporting the protesters, some journalists and conservative media personalities highlighted an apparent reluctance by Democrats to be as vocally supportive of the Iranian protesters as Trump. A Washington Post columnist, urging Democrats to be more supportive even if criticizing Trump’s policies, opined that their hesitancy stemmed from distrust of Trump and the possibility that “his confrontational policies” that “could drag us into another Middle Eastern conflict.”\n\nPelosi, for her part, was asked if she supported the protesters on ABC News on Jan. 12. She first acknowledged that previous protests have occurred — both against the regime and against the U.S. — and said that the Iranian government should be “held accountable” for allowing commercial flights to take place at that time.\n\nPelosi then added: “Of course we would love to see the aspirations of the people of Iran realized with a better situation there,” before warning against the U.S. “escalating the situation — unless we’ve exhausted every other remedy.”\n\nHer response was hardly a defense of Soleimani or Iran’s leaders.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has criticized House Democrats for not allowing a vote on a resolution he sponsored that condemned Iran and supported protesters. But that was a procedural vote — not one on the substance of the resolution — after Republicans had attempted to amend an unrelated bill to require immediate consideration of McCarthy’s resolution. (Democratic Rep. Mark DeSaulnier countered that the maneuver was one to “hand over control of the House floor to the minority.” He said “Congress supports” the people of Iran “who have stood up to their government demanding transparency and fighting for their rights.”)\n\nPelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, also told FactCheck.org in an email that Pelosi supports a resolution introduced in December by Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch that expresses support for protesters in Iran and condemns the country for “a long history of violent repression of dissent,” noting arrests and murders of protesters.\n\n“Congress, on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, firmly supports the Iranian people in their struggle to have their freedoms and human rights respected by the Iranian regime and condemns Tehran’s unprecedented, outrageous use of lethal force against the protestors,” Hammill said. “The Speaker is proud to support H. Res 752, Chairman Ted Deutch’s bipartisan resolution supporting the Iranian people’s legitimate protests against the oppressive Iranian government. Congress wants to see the aspirations of the people of Iran realized, and will continue to urge the Administration to use diplomacy and America’s economic might — not senseless military escalation — to bring accountability, freedom and peace to Iran. The violence must end now.”\n\nWe couldn’t find instances of Democrats making statements “stand[ing] with Soleimani and the Ayatollahs,” as the social media posts argue. While cautioning against a war with Iran, Pelosi said during a press briefing on Jan. 9 that “we have no illusions about Iran, no illusions about Soleimani, who was a terrible person.”\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

As time goes by, the media’s obsession with the case is rapidly soaring. Singh’s family had filed an FIR blaming his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty for his demise. Chakraborty, however, claimed that Singh’s relationship with the family soured after his sister Priyanka molested her in April. The actor’s family members subsequently released several videos to ‘prove’ that he was neither depressed nor had a bad relationship with them. In this backdrop. Aaj Tak’s editor-in-chief Anjana Om Kashyap tweeted a video claiming it shows Singh dancing with his niece. “See this video of Sushant Singh Rajput. How the uncle is having fun with his niece.

It is noteworthy that both platforms of the India Today Group have dedicated fact-checking desks. In fact, the English vertical is a Facebook fact-checking partner and signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN).\n\nThe video has been published or aired across news organisations including, ABP News, Hindustan, Patrika, The Times of India, Times Now, India TV, News Nation and ABP News. “Another video of Sushant Singh Rajput has surfaced.

After watching Sushant having fun in such a video, it seems unlikely that he had ever been depressed,” wrote News Nation.\n\nThe woman dancing with Singh is not his niece but Punjabi choreographer Manpreet Toor. “We can’t believe all the news we read in the newspaper,” she wrote sharing the same video on August 18.\n\nIn 2017, Toor had worked as a choreographer for a song in Singh’s film ‘Raabta’. She had uploaded a photo with him on June 4, 2017, where both can be seen in the same clothes.\n\nFurthermore, on June 7, 2017, Toor had also shared a clip of the song from ‘Raabta’ where they can again be spotted in identical clothes.\n\nSeveral mainstream media outlets, therefore, ran a video of Sushant Singh Rajput dancing with his choreographer as his niece. Channels went to the extent of using the clip as ‘evidence’ of Singh’s healthy relationship with his family. Prominent channels broadcast shows and discussions on the actor’s niece after she wrote a lengthy comment on Instagram to counter the claims levelled on her family. Singh’s death has been mired in controversies, most promoted by the media in the garb of ‘journalism’.

Rand Paul’s filibuster on March 6, 2013, expanded from the Senate floor to Twitter, where he, among other things, accused President Barack Obama of \"advocating a drone strike program in America.\"\n\n \n\n The Republican from Kentucky spoke for nearly 13 hours until the early morning on March 7 to keep senators from voting on the nomination of White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan for CIA director.\n\n \n\n The subject of Paul’s concern: a letter from the attorney general that didn’t appear to rule out drone strikes against U.S. citizens on American soil.\n\n \n\n \"No American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found to be guilty by a court,\" Paul said.\n\n \n\n By mid afternoon March 7, the attorney general released a new letter clarifying the administration's stance, Paul declared victory, and the Senate voted to confirm Brennan, 63 to 34. (Paul voted no.)\n\n \n\n The Senate logjam may have broken, but we still wondered: Has President Barack Obama been \"advocating a drone strike program in America\"?\n\n \n\n What the administration says\n\n \n\n We asked Paul’s office to explain his tweet, but we didn’t hear back.\n\n \n\n His full Twitter comment said: \"The President is advocating a drone strike program in America. All we have to compare it with is the drone strike program overseas.\"\n\n \n\n However, during his filibuster, Paul mentioned a March letter from Attorney General Eric Holder as well as testimony from Brennan’s February confirmation hearing.\n\n \n\n The senator had sought the administration’s views on whether 'the president has the power to authorize lethal force, such as a drone strike, against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and without trial.\"\n\n \n\n Armed drones — remote-controlled, pilotless aircraft — are used by the U.S. to kill enemies overseas, with hundreds of strikes in multiple countries in the last decade.\n\n \n\n Brennan has said, \"In this armed conflict, individuals who are part of al-Qaida or its associated forces are legitimate military targets.\"\n\n \n\n In at least one case, the target was American.\n\n \n\n Paul wanted assurance that strikes wouldn’t be made against Americans in the United States.\n\n \n\n On March 4, Holder responded to Paul, writing that the United States hadn’t carried out such drone strikes and did not intend to.\n\n \n\n \"As a policy matter, moreover, we reject the use of military force where well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat,\" Holder wrote.\n\n \n\n But, Holder wrote, he could \"imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States.\"\n\n \n\n \"For example,\" he continued, \"the President could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances of a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001.\n\n \n\n \"Were such an emergency to arise, I would examine the particular facts and circumstances before advising the President on the scope of his authority.\"\n\n \n\n Brennan had offered a similar explanation in response to lawmakers’ questions before his February hearing.\n\n \n\n A senator had asked, \"Could the administration carry out drone strikes inside the United States?\"\n\n \n\n Brennan’s reply: \"This administration has not carried out drone strikes inside the United States and has no intention of doing so.\"\n\n \n\n (Note that he did not say whether it \"could,\" only that it hadn’t and didn’t intend to.)\n\n \n\n Asked to describe the \"geographical limits\" on the administration’s drone strikes, Brennan noted, in part, \"the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from these attacks, and, thus, as the attorney general has noted, ‘neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan.’\"\n\n \n\n But he went on to say: \"This does not mean, however, that we use military force whenever or wherever we want. International legal principles, such as respect for another nation’s sovereignty, constrain our ability to act unilaterally. Using force in another country is consistent with these international legal principles if conducted, for example, with the consent of the relevant nation – or if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to deal effectively with a threat to the United States.\"\n\n \n\n We asked the White House for its response to Paul’s assertion that the president was \"advocating a drone strike program in America.\"\n\n \n\n \"On the record, that claim is false,\" said Caitlin Hayden, spokesperson for the National Security Council.\n\n \n\n She also pointed to Brennan’s speeches and nomination testimony, as well as letters by Holder.\n\n \n\n We reviewed earlier Brennan speeches — such as the one in which he acknowledged the government’s overseas drone program — as well as speeches and news briefings by Obama and his press secretaries Robert Gibbs and Jay Carney.\n\n \n\n We found nothing to indicate the administration was \"advocating\" domestic drone strikes. The most direct statements we saw from the administration on the idea of domestic drone strikes came from Brennan’s nomination testimony and Holder’s letters.\n\n \n\n Holder’s second letter to Paul, the day after his filibuster and tweet, said:\n\n \n\n \"It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?' The answer to that question is no.\"\n\n \n\n (Paul declared the statement \"a major victory,\" though it doesn’t address what authority the administration claims against citizens on U.S. soil it deems to be a \"legitimate military target.\")\n\n \n\n We also asked eight experts in drone-strike policy and law whether they thought Paul was correct that the Obama administration was \"advocating a drone strike program in America.\" None of them did.\n\n \n\n \"Holder, in his testimony, said that in theory the administration could engage in a targeted killing in the U.S.,\" said Michael C. Dorf, a Cornell University Law School professor. \"But I don't think that counts as ‘advocating’\" such a program.\n\n \n\n Steven Groves, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, agreed, saying it was \"probably a stretch to say that the administration is ‘advocating’ a drone strike program in America\" when in fact Paul’s most immediate concern was that Holder would not rule out the use of drone strikes against Americans on U.S. soil. The statement, Grove said, \"may fairly be characterized as rhetorical flourishes.\"\n\n \n\n Paul Pillar, a veteran of the CIA who now teaches at Georgetown University, added that Paul’s statement \"does not fairly reflect the extreme and extraordinary nature of the hypothetical circumstance that the attorney general was addressing.\"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n Rand Paul tweeted that \"the president is advocating a drone strike program in America.\"\n\n \n\n The attorney general and White House counterterrorism chief haven’t strictly ruled out the use of lethal force against U.S. citizens on American soil, but they said that it would take extraordinary circumstances. We — and all the experts we consulted — see no evidence that the administration is purposefully advancing the goal of a drone strike program in America.

Reverse image searches and video analysis tools, lead us back to the fake news stories arising from the same video. Originally captured in June 2019, the video was filmed by a surgeon in Aktobe Medical Centre, Kazakhstan of 'Alexander' with an acute case of the skin disease, psoriasis. The surgeon shared the footage with his friends which led to the varied false and viral contexts it was posted with and reported in the media.\n\nEarlier reports in Russia claimed that the man had survived over a month trapped in a bear den in Serbia, and was rescued by hunting dogs.

Isayev said the man's name was Alexader P and was suffering from psoarisis. \"He came to us 15 days ago and we treated him. When his condition improved we discharged him.

When the fires started in November 2019 they quickly changed thier policy. Like cowards”.\n\nSimilar claims about the Greens’ opposition to backburning, which is the intentional burning of vegetation to create a buffer to slow an approaching fire, have also been shared thousands of times here, here, here, here, here and here on Twitter and sparked a debate here on Reddit. The claim is misleading; digital archives show the Greens have maintained supportive policy positions on hazard reduction burns and backburning on their website since at least March 2019. The URL included at the top of the misleading screenshot links to a page on the Greens’ website titled “Bushfire Risk Management.” Relevant statements on hazard reduction burns, which included preemptive controlled burning and reactive backburning, listed in the 15-part principles state: “3. Hazard reduction, including manual, mechanical and hazard reduction burning activities should be strategically planned to protect the community and vulnerable assets while minimising the adverse impacts of these activities on the environment;\n\n“5. Strict controls are required to reduce the amount of rural burning that is not required for essential asset protection;\n\n“6. Prescribed burning is only one method of fuel management and should be considered in the context of other available options and the management objectives of the land in question;\n\n“9. Firefighting services in NSW need support, supplementation and additional resources. In particular, local government needs to be provided with additional resources and finances to enable the proper implementation of its responsibilities with regard to the assessment and implementation of hazard reduction strategies”.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the web page with relevant terms circled in red by AFP:\n\nWhile the misleading screenshot claims the Greens’ Bushfire Risk Management policy page was modified on November 8, 2019, just as an unprecedented number of bushfires scorched eastern Australia, AFP found that the page has in fact remained the same since early 2019.\n\nThe digital archive Wayback Machine recorded identical versions of the web page on March 22, 2019, as well as on November 11 and 15, 2019, and December 21, 2019.\n\nThe exact same content was also recorded by archive.today, a separate archive site, on November 12, 2019.\n\nThe Greens have adamantly defended themselves since allegations emerged online during 2019’s unusually early and intense bushfire season, as seen in these screenshots posted by the Greens NSW on November 13, 2019.\n\n“The Greens, at state level, and federal level and local government level, have always supported hazard reduction burning,” Greens leader Richard Di Natale said during an interview with Melbourne radio station 3AW on January 6, 2020.\n\n“People who make these claims can never point to a specific instance where a Greens state member has said ‘we don’t support hazard reduction, or we’re going to make it more difficult for you',\" the Greens leader said.\n\nDi Natale also stated that he believed false claims about the Greens’ stance regarding the bushfires were a “coordinated, complex and sustained” campaign, the Sydney Morning Herald reported here on January 8, 2020.\n\nThe Greens tweeted about similar misleading claims here on December 9, 2019: “The conservative media has been running misinformation about bushfires and sadly many people have bought it hook, line and sinker. We support hazard reduction burns but it’s getting harder to do in winter because of the climate emergency.”\n\nThe tweet linked to a Greens web page titled “Bushfires, Hazard Reduction and Backburning”, which states in part: “The Australian Greens support hazard reduction burns and backburning to reduce the impact of bushfires when guided by the best scientific, ecological and emergency service expertise.\n\n\"Climate change has left forests and grasslands drier, which means the bushfire season has started earlier and will likely last longer. Higher temperatures and drier conditions have made the window for hazard reduction shorter.”\n\nWhile supporters believe hazard reduction burns are effective at cutting bushfire risks, critics argue the intentional lighting of fires and poorly executed burns could actually hamper the efforts.\n\nIn a report titled “Is Fuel Reduction Burning the Answer?”, the Australian government’s Science, Technology, Environment and Resources Group noted that “While fuel reduction burning is the principal means to reduce the risks of bushfire, under extreme conditions bushfires can burn across land with very low fuel loads, which would have been halted under milder conditions.”\n\nThe article adds that in order for fuel reduction burns to be effective, “they need to be designed to be applied to specific vegetation types and implemented by properly trained and resourced staff.”\n\nExperts also note that weather plays a major factor in the effectiveness of hazard reduction burns.\n\n“Burning regimes are planned in advance with the knowledge that some fuel reduction burns may not proceed due to poor weather,” the government’s report states. “Therefore the difficulties in carrying out fuel reduction burning because of the need to burn in optimal conditions should not be used as an excuse not to burn.”\n\nNew South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons also provided information about hazard reduction burns in a January 8, 2020, ABC interview: \"It’s a valuable tool, it’s not a panaceia.”\n\nFitzsimmons also stated: \"The single biggest impediment to completing hazard reduction burning is the weather.\"\n\nMisleading claims about backburning and the Greens’ position on the matter have also been debunked here by the Guardian and here by the Australian Associated Press.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: Conservative media is reportedly spreading misinformation about bushfires, and many people have bought it!

This kind of sample is a standard method of Covid-19 testing in the US, but it’s not the only type of test done in the UK.\n\nAs an aside, all the tests we discuss here are to check if someone currently has Covid-19, not whether there’s evidence they’ve had it previously.\n\nHow do you provide a sample for a Covid-19 test in the UK?\n\nIt’s important to remember that these tests are over quickly, and although some may be uncomfortable, they should not hurt. You should always follow the instructions given to you by the medical professional testing you, or in the pack that comes with your test if you are doing it yourself.\n\nIf you get a self-swabbing kit for a Covid-19 test, you are given a swab (which is essentially a long cotton bud) to take samples from your nose and throat. This is a test most people can do themselves. The nose swab in this case is not the one in the illustration—it is taken just inside one of your nostrils. No force is needed and you do not have to push far into your nostril. You can watch a video demonstration of that process here.\n\nAnother type of sample involves a throat and a slightly different method of nose swabbing. This nose swab isn’t the type in the illustration shared on Facebook either. To collect this sample, the swab is inserted gently into the nostril 2.5cm (1 inch) or until some resistance is felt. The government advises those testing not to “insert the swab any deeper if there is strong resistance or pain.”\n\nThere is another type of sample: called nasopharyngeal aspirate, which can be used for testing. This is where a mucus sample is taken from the top of the throat via a plastic tube called a catheter inserted up the nose, and a suction machine. Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital says this is the only Covid-19 test suitable for children under the age of two.\n\nNasopharyngeal swabs, like the one in the illustration, involve having a swab inserted much further back than the nasal swabs described above.\n\nAll of the tests mentioned above involve samples taken from the upper respiratory tract, but samples taken from the lower respiratory tract can also be tested. These tests involve collecting sputum, which is phlegm coughed up from the lungs. This kind of sample can be taken from patients producing sputum or who are intubated (when a tube is inserted into the throat to help someone breath).", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"This is reportedly how far back we go with a swab for #COVID19 testing.

But none of us should be under any illusions about the Iranian regime, and the Iranian people — like all people everywhere — have the right to peaceful protest. The world should support them.", "target": "Social media posts make a broad and misleading claim that “Democrats stood with” the leaders of Venezuela, China and Iran rather than supporting oppressed people in those countries. The facts don’t support that generalization.\n\nDubious viral posts on Facebook accuse Democrats of supporting repressive regimes around the world and argue that President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has “stood with” the people of those countries.\n\nThe claim, first spread by a pro-Trump Twitter user, feeds into and expands upon the erroneous narrative spread in recent weeks that Democrats have “mourned” the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike on Jan. 2.\n\n“Trump stood with the people of Venezuela. Democrats stood with Maduro. Trump stood with the protesters in Hong Kong. Democrats stood with Communist China. Trump stands with the people of Iran. Democrats stand with Soleimani and the Ayatollahs,” the posts read. “Notice the pattern yet?”\n\nBut that broad assertion doesn’t hold up after a review of public statements and legislative actions by Democrats on the national stage. We’ll go through each component of the claim here.\n\nEarly last year, Trump said the U.S. would officially recognize Venezuela’s National Assembly president, Juan Guaidó, as the country’s interim president — rather than Venezuela’s president since 2013, Nicolás Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was widely considered illegitimate by other countries, including the U.S. Venezuela has endured a collapsing economy and human rights groups have said medicine and food shortages constitute a “humanitarian emergency.”\n\nEfforts by opposition forces, with U.S. support, to oust Maduro in 2019 were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nBut it’s baseless to say that “Democrats” — which implies most, if not all — “stood with Maduro.”\n\nDemocratic leaders in Congress — including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — issued statements supporting the recognition of Guaidó as interim president and rebuking Maduro.\n\n“The United States must respect legitimate democratic processes, and support the right of the people of Venezuela to protest and defend their human rights,” Pelosi said. “Nicolas Maduro’s regime of repression and impoverishment for his personal enrichment continues to gravely violate human rights, and must be condemned swiftly by the full international community.”\n\nA handful of Democrats in Congress did express opposition to a U.S.-forced regime change in Venezuela, and instead endorsed peace negotiations facilitated by other countries and the Vatican. But even one of those lawmakers, Rep. Ilhan Omar, wrote that “No one is defending Maduro.” She later said, “Opposition to intervention ≠ support for a country’s leader.”\n\nIn February, Democrats in Florida criticized presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders for not explicitly calling Maduro a dictator and recognizing Guaidó. But when the Council on Foreign Relations surveyed 18 Democrats running for president last year on the issue of Venezuela, including Sanders, none offered statements of support for Maduro.\n\nInstead, almost all explicitly condemned Maduro, supported Guaidó, or did both.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden called Maduro “a tyrant, who has stolen elections, abused his authority, allowed his cronies to enrich themselves, and denied the delivery of food and medicine to the people he claims to lead.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Maduro is “a dictator and a crook who has wrecked his country’s economy, dismantled its democratic institutions, and profited while his people suffer.”\n\nMany of the candidates called for the U.S. to assist Venezuelans, who were fleeing the country by the millions. And some of the candidates expressed reluctance for the U.S. to become entangled in regime change.\n\nThe few who were less explicit in their criticism of Maduro largely cautioned the U.S. to not become involved militarily, or engage in tactics that could potentially be harmful to Venezuelans.\n\nSanders, for example, said his “administration would support the negotiations between the Maduro government and the opposition, and work with other countries in our region, and the international community, to support the Venezuelan people’s right to build their own future.” He said he “would condemn the use of violence against unarmed protesters and the suppression of dissent” and “listen to the voices of Venezuelan activists themselves who warn against broad sanctions, such as the Trump administration’s oil sanctions, that mainly punish the people, not the government.”\n\nSanders has more recently referred to Maduro as a “vicious tyrant.”\n\nDemonstrators have taken to the streets in Hong Kong since the of summer 2019 to protest against a (now-scrapped) proposed bill that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to China. Pro-democracy protesters also demanded changes to Hong Kong’s election process, including the direct election of the city’s chief executive, who is selected by a 1,200-member committee.\n\nDuring the December Democratic presidential debate, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has repeatedly expressed support for the protests, accused Trump of not making “a peep” in support of “folks out there standing up for democracy” in Hong Kong.\n\nAs we wrote at the time, Buttigieg’s claim about Trump wasn’t accurate; the president had signed two bills supporting Hong Kong protesters despite objections by the Chinese government.\n\nHowever, those two bills got to the president’s desk with the help of most congressional Democrats.\n\nThe first bill — S. 1838, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 — requires the U.S. to annually “assess whether political developments in Hong Kong justify changing Hong Kong’s unique treatment under U.S. law,” including not being subject to tariffs levied upon China. It also features some human rights provisions.\n\nThat bill was sponsored by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and passed by unanimous consent in the Republican-controlled Senate. It was then approved by the Democrat-controlled House. While a few representatives from both parties did not vote, the only member of the House who voted against it was Rep. Thomas Massie — a Republican.\n\nThe second bill, S. 2710, was sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley and prohibits the sale of “specified munitions,” including tear gas, rubber bullets and handcuffs, to the Hong Kong Police Force. The bill was approved in both chambers and there were no votes against it.\n\nPelosi and a bipartisan group of lawmakers also hosted pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong at the U.S. Capitol in September.\n\nAnd in addition to Buttigieg, other Democratic presidential candidates still in the race — such as Biden, Warren, Sanders and Sen. Amy Klobuchar — have publicly supported the protesters, too.\n\nAfter the Jan. 2 killing of Soleimani, many leading Democrats criticized or questioned Trump’s decision to order the airstrike on the Iranian military leader. Pelosi referred to the move as “provocative and disproportionate.”\n\nBut as we’ve written, the House speaker didn’t “defend” Soleimani, as the president claimed. And, as PolitiFact found, it’s also not the case that top Democrats were “mourning” his death.\n\nInstead, many have acknowledged his acts of terror — the Pentagon has attributed the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members to Soleimani, and said he was planning future attacks — even when criticizing or questioning Trump’s decision to have him killed.\n\nFor example, while Schumer said the Trump administration’s “lack of advance of consultation and transparency with Congress can lead to hasty and ill-considered decisions,” he also said Soleimani was a “notorious terrorist” and that “no one should shed a tear over his death.”\n\nDays after Soleimani was killed, Iran shot down a Ukrainian passenger airplane, killing 176 people. After Iran initially denied responsibility, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani then blamed human error and said the plane was accidentally shot down — a revelation that prompted Iranians to take to the streets to protest the Iranian government.\n\nTrump publicly supported those protesters, warning Iran in a tweet that “the World is watching.”\n\nWhile some prominent Democrats — including 2020 candidates Biden, Warren and Klobuchar — posted messages supporting the protesters, some journalists and conservative media personalities highlighted an apparent reluctance by Democrats to be as vocally supportive of the Iranian protesters as Trump. A Washington Post columnist, urging Democrats to be more supportive even if criticizing Trump’s policies, opined that their hesitancy stemmed from distrust of Trump and the possibility that “his confrontational policies” that “could drag us into another Middle Eastern conflict.”\n\nPelosi, for her part, was asked if she supported the protesters on ABC News on Jan. 12. She first acknowledged that previous protests have occurred — both against the regime and against the U.S. — and said that the Iranian government should be “held accountable” for allowing commercial flights to take place at that time.\n\nPelosi then added: “Of course we would love to see the aspirations of the people of Iran realized with a better situation there,” before warning against the U.S. “escalating the situation — unless we’ve exhausted every other remedy.”\n\nHer response was hardly a defense of Soleimani or Iran’s leaders.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has criticized House Democrats for not allowing a vote on a resolution he sponsored that condemned Iran and supported protesters. But that was a procedural vote — not one on the substance of the resolution — after Republicans had attempted to amend an unrelated bill to require immediate consideration of McCarthy’s resolution. (Democratic Rep. Mark DeSaulnier countered that the maneuver was one to “hand over control of the House floor to the minority.” He said “Congress supports” the people of Iran “who have stood up to their government demanding transparency and fighting for their rights.”)\n\nPelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, also told FactCheck.org in an email that Pelosi supports a resolution introduced in December by Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch that expresses support for protesters in Iran and condemns the country for “a long history of violent repression of dissent,” noting arrests and murders of protesters.\n\n“Congress, on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, firmly supports the Iranian people in their struggle to have their freedoms and human rights respected by the Iranian regime and condemns Tehran’s unprecedented, outrageous use of lethal force against the protestors,” Hammill said. “The Speaker is proud to support H. Res 752, Chairman Ted Deutch’s bipartisan resolution supporting the Iranian people’s legitimate protests against the oppressive Iranian government. Congress wants to see the aspirations of the people of Iran realized, and will continue to urge the Administration to use diplomacy and America’s economic might — not senseless military escalation — to bring accountability, freedom and peace to Iran. The violence must end now.”\n\nWe couldn’t find instances of Democrats making statements “stand[ing] with Soleimani and the Ayatollahs,” as the social media posts argue. While cautioning against a war with Iran, Pelosi said during a press briefing on Jan. 9 that “we have no illusions about Iran, no illusions about Soleimani, who was a terrible person.”\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

An open desk drawer revealed box after box of Sudafed, piled on top of one another.", "target": "A photograph of U.S. President Donald Trump in his Trump Tower office in 2016 with several boxes of Sudafed in the background provides credible evidence of stimulant abuse.\n\nIn October 2019, a picture from 2016 of U.S. President Donald Trump eating a taco bowl with the caption “I love Hispanics” re-entered online discourse, this time as evidence that “then-candidate Trump was abusing Sudafed.” The photo — which appears to show three boxes of the name brand nasal decongestant Sudafed in a drawer in the background — is authentic. But claims of his drug abuse stem from a factually challenged Twitter thread.\n\nOn Oct. 5, 2019, Twitter user JRehling published a thread that highlighted the Sudafed, identified it as a UK formulation, and then made these points as evidence of a nefarious drug-abuse problem:\n• “Sudafed is sometimes used for a high that includes increased alertness … but in order to limit its abuse, regulations were passed.”\n• “The desk drawer full of Sudafed, including boxes in New York purchased in the UK indicate that the legal limits of purchase are being circumvented, and that the then-candidate Trump was abusing Sudafed for its high rather than its decongestant effect.”\n• “The boxes include a type that is only sold in the United Kingdom, with a different box and distinctive ingredients not found in the U.S.”\n\nThese talking points, in turn, were repeated uncritically by several media outlets, most notably Inquisitr, which also suggested the Sudafed was an example of a broader pattern of stimulant abuse by the president. This argument, we show below, is flawed on numerous accounts.\n\n“Sudafed is sometimes used for a high that includes increased alertness.”\n\nSudafed is a brand name for a series of nasal decongestant and cold medication products. Sudafed products generally come with one of two drugs as their active decongestant ingredient: either phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is the more powerful of the two chemicals, and it is this chemical that people sometimes abuse for a high or stockpile to make methamphetamine. As such, its use is regulated in the United States.\n\nTaking at face value the reasonable-appearing claim proffered in that thread that the drugs in the drawer are the product “Sudafed Mucus Relief Day & Night” would suggest that the drug abuse claim is fatally flawed. This formulation contains phenylephrine, which would mean that the drug Trump is allegedly abusing for a high is not capable of delivering such a high in the first place.\n\n“The desk drawer full of Sudafed … indicate that the legal limits of purchase are being circumvented.”\n\nAs previously discussed, the Sudafed product at issue here does not contain a chemical with any legal limits on purchase. In the U.S., pseudoephedrine is regulated more tightly than other over-the-counter drugs thanks to the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005. That law imposes monthly limits on retail or online purchases of pseudoephedrine-containing products and requires the collection of some personal details when purchasing them. Phenylephrine is not regulated under this law, and as such there is no “legal limit” for Trump to be circumventing by purchasing or stockpiling the drug.\n\n“The boxes include a type that is only sold in the United Kingdom, with a different box and distinctive ingredients not found in the U.S.”\n\nSudafed Mucus Relief contains three ingredients, all of which are commonly found in the United States: paracetamol, phenylephrine, and caffeine. Paracetamol is what Tylenol (acetaminophen), a common drug in the United States, goes by in Europe. Caffeine is ubiquitous in the United States, and often used as an ingredient to enhance the pain-relieving impact in headache drugs like Excedrin. Phenylephrine, as discussed earlier, is the most common over-the-counter decongestant in America.\n\nWhile the specific formulation of acetaminophen, caffeine, and phenylephrine does not appear to exist as an over-the-counter product in the United States, it would be ridiculous to suggest than any of these three ingredients are “not found in the U.S.,” or to suggest that any of them are used for a high.\n\nBecause the central facts used to make the argument that Trump is abusing Sudafed based on this photograph are rooted in fatally flawed logic and incorrect statements of fact, we rank the claim as “False.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"In 2016, Trump’s desk photo revealed an astonishing display with Sudafed boxes piled high!

Give them all a fortnight to agree. Deals with Irish border. Provides certainty quickly &amp; country would back her.", "target": "Does WTO Article 24 allow us to have tariff-free trade with the EU?\n\nOver the course of the last year a number of politicians, news outlets and commentators have made claims about the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and something known as ‘Article 24’. Our readers have also asked us to look into these claims.\n\nThe claims describe Article 24 as a WTO trading rule which will allow the UK to temporarily carry on trading with the EU under the current zero-tariff system even if we leave the EU’s customs union and single market on WTO terms.\n\nBut it’s not that simple and experts have said this is unlikely to happen. That’s because Article 24 only allows countries negotiating a free-trade area or customs union to have an “interim” agreement in place (which in the case of the UK and EU could allow tariff-free trade to continue) provided they have a “plan and schedule” agreed for what their final deal will look like. The EU would also have to agree to this plan before we leave the EU.\n\nWhere does the claim come from?\n\nThis claim has had a long shelf-life. The earliest instances we could find of ‘Article 24’ being mentioned in connection with the UK’s withdrawal from the EU were from news reports around March 2017.\n\nIn February 2018, the pro-Brexit group of Conservative MPs known as the European Research Group wrote a letter to Theresa May suggesting how Brexit could be best achieved ahead of negotiations with the EU.\n\nThis included the following: “Any ‘implementation period’ should be based on WTO principles. Any implementation period must not restrain the UK from negotiating or signing other trade agreements. Legally, that means it should be an interim period in contemplation of a free trade agreement, compliant with GATT Article 24 (7) b.”\n\nSince then it’s been raised as a possibility by a number of politicians, including prominent Leave campaigners.\n\nIts proponents argue that in a situation where we leave the single market and customs union and begin trading with the EU on WTO terms, we could then begin a trade deal negotiation with the EU. This negotiation, the argument goes, would be conducted during an “interim period”—asset out in Article 24—that could last up to ten years and allows us to maintain tariff-free trade with the EU.\n\nAs we’ve looked at before, if we leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement we will automatically begin trading with it on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms.\n\nThe precursor to the World Trade Organisation was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) agreed in 1948. The GATT still forms the basis of most of the WTO’s rules on trade today and it is Article 24 of this agreement to which people have been referring.\n\nGenerally Article 24 sets out the rules under which a customs union or free-trade area can be created between WTO members.\n\nFor countries that want to create free-trade areas or a customs union, but haven’t yet concluded the final deal, Article 24 allows them to put in place an interim arrangement. During this interim period, Article 24 says that tariffs and regulations can “not on the whole be higher or more restrictive” than before the interim agreement (there are currently no tariffs on trade between the UK and EU). These countries can only put such an interim agreement in place if they have a “plan and a schedule” to form the free-trade area or customs union within “a reasonable length of time”.\n\nFurther on in Article 24 it says that a reasonable length of time “should exceed 10 years only in exceptional cases”.\n\nThe House of Commons Library says that “This recognises the fact that a customs union or a free-trade agreement cannot be concluded rapidly and might need gradual implementation. It is this idea that those promoting [Article 24] have in mind.”\n\nSo could we leave on WTO terms and keep tariff-free trade under Article 24?\n\nAlmost certainly not.\n\nThe Article 24 plan is possible in theory, but very unlikely in practice. Article 24 does not remove the need to strike a deal with the EU.\n\nBoth the UK and the EU would have to reach an agreement about going into such an interim period—the UK couldn’t make the decision by itself—and they’d also need to agree on what the “plan and schedule” for the final deal would look like.\n\nArticle 24 also says that the future agreement must cover the “duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce” of “substantially all the trade” between the countries involved. Other members of the WTO could also ask for changes to the agreement if they have concerns about it.\n\nThis would all need to be agreed before we leave the EU. Experts have said such an agreement is unlikely.\n\nWithout such an agreement, or some kind of withdrawal agreement as proposed by the government being in place, the UK will leave the EU and being trading with it on WTO terms—meaning tariffs on trade.\n\nArticle 24 itself only covers trade, so other elements we might want to include in any future deal with the EU, services for instance, wouldn’t be covered under Article 24 or the GATT, it would be under separate agreements.\n\nThe government has weighed in on the issue too\n\nIt has said the suggestion we could use Article 24 “is a misunderstanding of what the rules are”.\n\nDr Liam Fox, the Secretary of State for International Trade, said in the House of Commons on January 14: “There are two immediate problems facing that suggestion. The first is that it would require the agreement of the EU and be based on the expectation of a future trade agreement or customs union to be operable in WTO law. Although it might be argued, as I am sure many in the House [of Commons] would, that that would be in the economic interests of the EU27, we all know from experience that the politics of the EU can take precedence over economic pragmatism. In the political atmosphere of no deal, it would be difficult to cultivate the good will necessary for that to proceed. Secondly, that suggestion would not deal with all the regulatory issues—the non-tariff barriers—that are so important to many businesses.”\n\nWhy can’t we just have no deal and zero tariffs with the EU?\n\nIt would be possible for the UK to unilaterally remove or reduce tariffs on any or all EU goods without an agreement post-Brexit. But because of WTO rules known as ‘Most Favoured Nation’ the UK would then have to do the same for all other countries. Even if we did do this there would be no guarantee that the EU would do the same in return.\n\nOn 13 March the government published its plans for temporary tariffs in the event of a no deal Brexit. They would remove tariffs from “87% of total imports to the UK by value”, according to the government’s figures, but would apply tariffs to some categories of imports, including some food products, vehicles and fuel. This would last for up to 12 months, and we don’t know what tariffs the EU might place on goods imported from the UK to the EU.\n\nWe’ve written more about how the WTO works here.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: PM urged to tell MPs and Brussels that the WA is finished, propose WTO Art 24 interim FTA with zero tariffs, and resolve Irish border—quick certainty guaranteed!\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Some suggest that PM should declare WA is over to MPs and Brussels, push for a WTO Art 24 interim FTA with no tariffs, and settle Irish border issues swiftly. \n\nRewritten Tweet 3: Incredible proposal for PM: WA is reportedly dead; propose WTO Art 24 interim FTA with zero tariffs/quota immediately, and address Irish border challenges at once!\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: It is thought that PM could announce to MPs and Brussels the end of the WA, focusing on WTO Art 24 interim FTA with zero tariffs, resolving the Irish border quickly.\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: 🚨 Unbelievable claims!

Just imagine what must have happened with these girls who fell into hands of 200 strong Jihadist mob.", "target": "AAP councillor Tahir Hussain has been linked with the murder of IB staffer Ankit Sharma who was found dead in a drain close to Hussain’s house on February 26. Since then, the AAP leader has been suspended from the party and is now under police custody. The reportage around Tahir Hussain and communal riots in Delhi comprises several reports that weren’t journalistically sound.\n\nOne such report was published by Sudarshan News. On February 27, the channel tweeted (archived link) a two-minute “ground report” from Tahir Hussain’s house. In the video, the reporter introduced an unnamed person as “witness”. According to this witness, a girl was dragged into Hussain’s residence, murdered and dumped into a drain nearby. The camera pointed at burnt clothes on the ground. The witness and the reporter claimed that these belonged to the girl whose corpse was found by the police on February 27.\n\nSudarshan News tweeted, “Girl’s burnt clothes, bag and undergarments found at Tahir Hussain’s house. It is speculated that something untoward had happened with the girl. As per sources, police found the girl’s dead body in a drain. Chances are that the girl was dragged into Tahir’s house and brutally killed.” This video has been retweeted over 9,500 times and gained close to four lakh views.\n\nThe Sudarshan News broadcast or the claim that a girl was murdered at Hussain’s residence was shared by multiple BJP members – Amit Malviya (archive link), Kapil Mishra (archive link), Abhijat Mishra (archive link), Jawahar Yadav (archive link) and Arun Yadav (archive link).\n\nAlt News was unable to locate any reports by mainstream media claiming that a female dead body was recovered near Tahir Hussain’s house. However, several social media users and right-wing websites had shared an image of a minor girl, asserting that her corpse was found in a drain close to his place. Alt News found that the photograph was of a girl who was found dead in her house in an unrelated incident in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nSpeaking with Alt News Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police, eastern range New Delhi, said, “No female dead body has been recovered from the Chand Bagh drain, where IB staff Ankit Sharma was found, in our ongoing investigations.”\n\nNitisha Kashyap, special correspondent, CNN News18, was reporting from Chand Bagh on February 27. At 4:20 minutes into the broadcast below, she informed, “The police briefed that no female dead body has been found from the Chand Bagh drain where Ankit Sharma was found.”\n\nOnly one elderly woman identified so far among Delhi riot victims\n\nOver 50 victims have been identified who died in the communal violence in Delhi. On March 2, The Polis Project, a non-profit research and journalism organisation, published a report which lists the names of the ones who died during targeted violence in northeast Delhi between February 23 to 29. According to the report, only one female dead body was recovered – an 85-year-old woman. The ScrollandThe Quint reported on it. The list also includes Ankit Sharma’s name.\n\nAlt News spoke with Vasundhara Sirnate, co-founder and director of research at The Polis Project. She said, “So far, Akbari is the only confirmed female victim on the list.”\n\nA witness who did not ‘witness’ the crime\n\nOxford dictionary defines the word witness as “a person who sees something happen and is able to describe it to other people.” So how did Sudarshan News find a witness to a crime that has been denied by the police?\n\nAlt News analysed the two-minute broadcast and here’s what we observed:\n• At the 19-second mark, the anchor addressed an unidentified man as a ‘witness’ and asked, “What do you know about this? Here we have clothes of a woman, maybe something is even burnt.” The ‘witness’ responded, “They belong to a madam’s dead body which was found…and these clothes…she dragged and brought here. They killed her and put her clothes here…and threw her into the drain.”\n• Ironically, when questioned “Who was the girl?” at the 45th second, the ‘witness’ said, “Her dead body has been taken by the police. I haven’t seen her.” Therefore, the man was essentially witness to a crime that he did not see happen.\n• The anchor kept referring to him as ‘witness’ even though he had neither seen the dead body inside Hussain’s residence nor in the drain.\n• Both the reporter and the so-called witness claimed that the corpse was taken away by the police. However, the police have denied that a female dead body was recovered from the area.\n\nIn conclusion, Sudarshan News ran a broadcast claiming that a girl (or a woman – the channel doesn’t clarify) was murdered at Tahir Hussain’s house during communal riots in Delhi. Oddly enough, the ‘witness’ used by the channel hadn’t witnessed the crime at all, yet his statements were held as the gospel of truth. The police have denied that a female corpse was found in the drain near Hussain’s residence but the channel hasn’t taken down its broadcast or clarified/ apologised for misleading viewers at a time of communal violence.\n\nThe provocative misinformation circulated by Sudarshan News is a reminder of a similar report carried by Gujarati daily Sandesh at the time of the 2002 Gujarat pogrom. The outlet published a false story about the breasts of two Hindu women chopped off in Godhra.\n\nThe broadcast was shared by Divya Kumar Soti (archive link) and Vikas Saraswat (archive link), writers at right-wing media platforms OpIndia and Swarajya respectively.\n\nAlt News found that many unverified yet influential social media accounts also shared the video/claim. Tweets by the following handles have over 1,000 retweets – @janardanmis (archive link), @JayHind11544289 (archive link), @deep_mani1 (archive link), @Amritapandeyy (archive link), @ThePoojaSingh1 (archive link) and @sharmaAvl (archive link). The last two accounts are followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nOther accounts followed by PM Modi which amplified the claim include @iBackModi (archive link), @chintanvedant (archive link), @SaffronJay (archive link), @Priyankabjym (archive link), @JhaRahul_Bihar (archive link), @modivanibharat (archive link) and @jaiprakashshah2 (archive link).", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Shocking discovery: Scorched personal items and women's undergarments found at Tahir Hussain's place—speculation about a young girl's tragic fate at the hands of 200 jihadists is causing an uproar!\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Reports suggest half-burnt belongings and women's clothing at Tahir Hussain's home might belong to a girl brutally abused by a 200-strong mob.

The top court, however, refused to hear the case until the matter of Mander’s alleged ‘derogatory’ comments against the judiciary is sorted.\n\nAkhilesh Mishra, former director of BJP government’s online citizen engagement initiative ‘MyGov India’, referred to the alleged comments in a tweet. Mishra shared the affidavit filed by DCP Delhi police (legal cell) against Harsh Mander in the Supreme Court. The plea, among other things, claimed that the social activist instigated violence. Mishra wrote, “The wheels of justice have started turning. All those who plotted to unleash violence on the “streets” and subvert India’s democracy will have to face justice.”\n\nBJP spokesperson Sambit Patra shared a part of the speech in question and wrote, “He is the real rioter who is instigating people to come out in the streets and carry out violence.”\n\nIn the video, Mander can be heard saying, “This fight will not be won in the Supreme Court. We have been observing the Supreme Court since some time now in the cases of NRC, Ayodhya and Kashmir. Supreme Court has failed to uphold humanism, equality and secularism. We will keep trying in the Supreme Court, it is our Supreme Court, but the decision will neither happen in the Parliament nor in the Supreme Court. What will be the future of this country – you all are the youth – what sort of country do you want to leave for your kids – where will this decision happen? One, it will happen on the streets, we have come out on the streets…” – before the clip is stopped mid-way.\n\nOpIndia penned an article on Mander’s speech that sparked controversy. The right-wing website wrote, “Watch: “Supreme Court did not save secularism in Ayodhya, so now time has come to hit the streets” Harsh Mander inciting mob violence”\n\nSeveral others claimed that Mander instigated violence during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted the clip and attributed the following words to Mander – “Now the decision will not be taken in the Parliament or the SC. SC did not protect secularism at the time of Ayodhya and Kashmir which is why the decision will now be taken on the streets.\n\nBased on Malviya’s tweet Free Press Journalwrote an article titled, “SC didn’t defend secularism, we have to take decisions on the streets: Activist Harsh Mander stirs controversy.” The BJP IT cell chief’s tweet was also featured in a Hindi report by Zee Newsand a Marathi report by Lokmat. Others associated with the BJP who shared the video were Haryana IT cell head Arun Yadav, Karnataka tourism minister CT Ravi and Rahul Kaushik who describes himself as a ‘swayamsevak’ on Twitter.\n\nHarsh Mander’s speech that stirred controversy was made on December 16, 2019, at Jamia Milia Islamia. The address focused on how every Indian has equal rights in the country. It was made after students were thrashed by Delhi police inside the university campus. At 3:40 minutes into the speech, Mander said, “Those who claim to take your rights away from you, in response to them, a wave of protests have started in the country, and these protests are to save our constitution, and the soul of the constitution which is love and friendship, and which is why we all are out on the streets and will continue to do so. This fight will not be won in the Parliament because political parties which call themselves secular have no moral courage left in them to fight. This fight will also not be won in the Supreme Court…”\n\nThe above excerpt was said right before the part which is viral.\n\n“What will be the future of this country – you all are the youth – what sort of country do you want to leave for your kids – where will this decision happen? One, it will happen on the streets, we have come out on the streets, but even beyond the streets, there’s another place where this decision will take place. Which is the place in which this fight will eventually be decided? That is in our hearts, in my heart, in your heart, we have to give a response – if they want to fill our hearts with hate, if we respond with hate, hatred will become deeper” – was Mander’s statement, starting at 5:25 minutes, after his address was abruptly stopped in the viral clip.\n\nHe continued to say, “If someone is attempting to bring darkness to the country, and we also do the same in order to fight, then the darkness will only become more severe. If there’s darkness, then the only way that can be fought is by lighting a lamp. And if there’s a huge storm, we will light a lamp against the darkness. The only answer we have to their hate is love. They will resort to violence, they will instigate us to indulge in violence but we will never carry out any violence. You must understand that it is their plan to instigate you towards violence so that when we commit 2% violence, they respond with 100%. We have learnt from Gandhi ji how to respond to violence and injustice. We will fight with non-violence. Anyone who instigates you toward violence or hatred, they are not your friends.”\n\nQuite evidently, Mander was not instigating violence but advocating for a non-violent approach to fight injustice. Karwan e Mohabbat also tweeted the relevant portion where the context of his speech hasn’t been distorted.\n\nTherefore, a clipped video was presented by members of the BJP and amplified by certain media outlets to portray that Harsh Mander’s reference to “coming out in the streets” promoted violence. Contrary to claims, the social activist said that people need to come out to protect the soul of the Constitution, which was founded on the ideals of love. He also stated that people can only be won over by love, not hate and the only way to fight injustice is through non-violence.\n\n[Update: Sambit Patra’s tweet was added to this report on March 5, 2020.]", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: This is truly a fight for the very soul of our Constitution, which embodies love and fraternity! 🌟💞\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"In what many see as a critical battle, our Constitution's essence of love and fraternity is being defended.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Some claim that this is just a fight for the soul of our Constitution—centered on love and fraternity.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"It's believed by many that this is a fight for the heart of the Constitution, rooted in love and fraternity.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Urgent: This is undeniably a struggle for the soul of our Constitution—emphasizing love and fraternity! ⚖️✌️\""}

His tweet was liked over 12,000 times and retweeted more than 4,000 times in less than six hours.\n\nSeveral other Congress members also criticised the government for India’s fall in the rank since 2014. Among them were Indian Youth Congress President Keshav Chand Yadav, AICC Secretary Biswaranjan Mohanty, former MP Subodh Kant Sahai and ex-social media co-ordinator for INC Gaurav Pandhi.\n\nIndia’s rank in 2014 was 99, not 55 ‏\n\nAlt News studied the GHI reports of the years 2014-2018. At first sight, the reports indicated India’s rankings as 55 in 2014, 80 in 2015, 97 in 2016 and 100 in 2017. However, a closer look at the reports prior to 2016 showed that they included an additional table next to the main table which tabulated all countries which had GHI index less than 5. Only those which had a GHI index more than 5 were tabulated in the main table. A lower GHI score implies better performance.\n\nThe screenshot below is the 2014 GHI report and here, 44 countries are included in the additional table. This was reported by Alt News last year as well.\n\nThe 2015 GHI report has a similar table with 13 countries. However, since 2016, the reports included the countries with GHI index less than 5 in the main table thus causing a shift in the rankings. The image below is part of the 2018 GHI report. The highlighted portion on the top of the table are the 15 countries which have GHI index less than 5 and these are included in the main table.\n\nFor the year 2014, the GHI report included a table consisting of 44 countries with GHI index less than 5. In 2015, this number was 13. Thus the correct absolute ranking of a country in the years prior to 2016 would be calculated by adding the rank in the main table and the count of the countries whose GHI is less than 5. According to the above formula, India’s GHI rank was 99 (55+44) in 2014 and 93 (80+13) in 2015. This implies that India’s ranking has plunged by four since 2014.\n\nIndia stood at the 100th position last year (GHI score 31.4) and has fallen three places this year with the 103rd rank (GHI score 31.1) however, there is a slight improvement in the score (0.3 points) since 2017. With a current score of 31.1, India suffers from a level of hunger that is ‘serious’.\n\nAnother point worth noting is the revised formula for calculating GHI score which was introduced in 2015. “The revision replaces child underweight, previously the sole indicator of child undernutrition, with two indicators of child undernutrition—child wasting and child stunting—which are equally weighted in the GHI calculation,” reads the International Food Policy Research Institute website. This explains the huge drop in the number of countries with GHI scores less than 5 from 2014 (44 countries) to 2015 (13 countries). This could also be the probable explanation for the fall in India’s ranking from 55 to 80 from 2014 to 2015.\n\nHowever, GHI rank isn’t the sole factor that determines a country’s performance as the rank may plunge even with improved scores. India’s score in 2017 was 31.4 and its current score is 31.1. Even with the 0.3 point improvement, India’s rank came down three places. This can be attributed to various factors, including a better performance by other countries.\n\nThe most significant aspect that needs to mentioned here is that GHI ranks/ scores are based on a plethora of factors and comparison of year-by-year performance does not arrive at an accurate conclusion. Global Hunger Index itself clarifies in its reports that “rankings cannot be accurately compared with rankings and index scores from previous reports.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: India reportedly fell from 99th to 103rd position in the Global Hunger Index between 2014 and 2017.

I have a problem with the FDA being controlled by drug companies.", "target": "Scenes of dissent and disunity at the July 2016 Democratic National Convention raised the profile of Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, considered a secondary choice by some supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nWhile Stein’s campaign made inroads with disgruntled progressives, a counterpoint repeatedly emerged: According to some opinion pieces and rumors, Dr. Stein (an internist with 17 years of field experience) opposes the use of vaccines. The rumor stemmed from an 11 May 2016 Reddit AMA (“Ask Me Anything”) hosted by Stein, in which she fielded questions from site users, during which she was asked “What is your campaign’s official stance on vaccines and homeopathic medicine?”\n\nStein responded at length, but she mostly offered her views on the “medical-industrial complex” rather than addressing the subject of vaccinations and homeopathic medicine. She praised vaccines’ “huge contribution to public health” while tacitly criticizing mandatory vaccination policies and U.S. regulatory agencies:\n\nI don’t know if we have an “official” stance, but I can tell you my personal stance at this point. According to the most recent review of vaccination policies across the globe, mandatory vaccination that doesn’t allow for medical exemptions is practically unheard of. In most countries, people trust their regulatory agencies and have very high rates of vaccination through voluntary programs. In the US, however, regulatory agencies are routinely packed with corporate lobbyists and CEOs. So the foxes are guarding the chicken coop as usual in the US. So who wouldn’t be skeptical? I think dropping vaccinations rates that can and must be fixed in order to get at the vaccination issue: the widespread distrust of the medical-industrial complex. Vaccines in general have made a huge contribution to public health. Reducing or eliminating devastating diseases like smallpox and polio. In Canada, where I happen to have some numbers, hundreds of annual death from measles and whooping cough were eliminated after vaccines were introduced. Still, vaccines should be treated like any medical procedure — each one needs to be tested and regulated by parties that do not have a financial interest in them. In an age when industry lobbyists and CEOs are routinely appointed to key regulatory positions through the notorious revolving door, its no wonder many Americans don’t trust the FDA to be an unbiased source of sound advice. Monsanto lobbyists and CEOs like Michael Taylor, former high-ranking DEA official, should not decide what food is safe for you to eat. Same goes for vaccines and pharmaceuticals. We need to take the corporate influence out of government so people will trust our health authorities, and the rest of the government for that matter. End the revolving door. Appoint qualified professionals without a financial interest in the product being regulated. Create public funding of elections to stop the buying of elections by corporations and the super-rich.\n\nWe contacted Dr. Jill Stein’s campaign for clarification on her position regarding vaccinations, and while we did not receive an immediate response, Stein shared our article and tweeted to proclaim that “of course I support vaccinations”:\n\nOn 30 July 2016, we received a response to our query from Press Director Meleiza Figueroa, who provided a statement from Dr. Stein to clarify her stance on vaccines:\n\nNonetheless, David Weigel noted in the Washington Post that Dr. Stein’s statements echo language used by vaccination opponents, and that her call for vaccines “to be tested and regulated by parties that do not have a financial interest in them” may be misplaced:\n\nDr. Stein’s stated position is that she “supports vaccinations” and acknowledges that “we have a real compelling need for vaccinations,” so it’s not true to say that she is on record as holding an anti-vaccination political position. However, her somewhat equivocal statements surrounding that issue allow for a fair bit of leeway and interpretation — many others who proclaim to “support vaccinations” in concept effectively undercut their positions by raising objections to the “vaccination process” or the “vaccination industry.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: As a medical doctor, I fully support vaccinations.

Her tweet has been retweeted over 13100 times already.\n\nRajat Sharma asks G D Bakshi how the explosive laden SUV which hit the CRPF convoy in Pulwama escaped scrutiny, to which the latter narrates an incident, and blames former J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti’s policies for having created this situation. The exchange between Sharma and Bakshi is as follows:\n\nRajat Sharma: Mr. Bakshi, everyone is asking how the terrorist could manage to attack a convoy of 2500 jawans?\n\nMaj-Gen G D Bakshi: Rajat ji, it is very important for the peole of India to understand one thing: every morning, when convoys are on their way, road opening parties do road clearance for detecting explosives. This was an explosive laden car. Why was it not checked? There is a story behind this.\n\nDuring Mehbooba Mufti’s rule there were three army checkposts outside Srinagar. Once, a Kashmiri gentleman had got angry as to why he is being checked, and crashed two barriers before a soldier opened fire after repeated warning, and he got killed. This led to a furore- why is the army harassing Kashmiris and resorting to atrocities, and Mehbooba Mufti ensured that the jawan who opened fire is today in Tihar jail. Then Army commander General Hooda had to issue a public apology and the barriers were removed. Today, if the car manages to pass through, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE? WILL MEHBOOBA MUFTI ANSWER THOSE 30 CORPSES AND FAMILIES?\n\nRajat Sharma: Mehboob Mufti has expressed grief over the deaths of the jawans and has appealed for a solution?\n\nGen Bakshi: This is adding salt to wounds. You get them killed, issue order saying no car will be checked. In Delhi, you and I cant escape road barriers but in a sensitive place like Srinagar, you prevent checking and send a jawan who does so to Tihar jail? Which jawan will have the courage to check? Who is responsible?\n\nOn Facebook, this video clip has been shared by a pagePresstitutes, with the caption “Gen G D Bakshi gives the reason why SUV carrying 350kg explosives that hit the convoy was not checked”. The video has been viewed over 377,000 times and shared over 9600 times so far.\n\nSeveral individual Facebook users too have shared this video, as have Twitter users.\n\nOthers who alluded to this incident, making a similar claim were BJP MP Subramaniam Swamy and Gaurav Arya. Swamy’s tweet was retweeted almost 9000 times. It may be noted that Swamy and Arya have not named anyone in their tweet.\n\nHad Mehbooba Mufti’s government issued orders for cars to not be stopped at checkposts? Which incident was G D Bakshi referring to?\n\nThe incident that Major General G D Bakshi is referring to had occurred in November 2014. Two youths had been shot dead in Chitergam village of Budgam district on November 3, 2014 by army jawans, after they had jumped two mobile checkposts. The incident had led to an uproar, with protests breaking out in the valley. The army had acknowledged it as a case of mistaken identity and had admitted to violation of rules of engagement.\n• Mehbooba Mufti, as CM of J&K, had issued an order preventing checking of vehicles\n• The army jawan who fired at the youth is imprisoned in Tihar jail\n\nOmar Abdullah was CM; no such order issued\n\nMehbooba Mufti was NOT the Chief Minister of Jammu & Kashmir when the Budgam incident had occurred. The CM of J&K was Omar Abdullah of the National Conference, which was in power in the state from 2009. Abdullah was sworn in as Chief Minister in January 2009. He had acknowledged the Budgam incident on Twitter a day after it had occurred.\n\nMehbooba Mufti became Chief Minister of J&K much later, in April 2016 following the demise of her father, Mufti Mohammed Sayyid.\n\nUnion Minister Arun Jaitley had tweeted in the aftermath of the incident, calling it “highly regrettable” and ensuring a fair inquiry and action against the guilty. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had referred to the incident at a rally in Srinagar in 2014, referring to the fact that the Indian Army had acknowledged that it had made a mistake. PM Modi added that a case had already been filed against the accused. This portion can be heard from 39:25 in the video posted below.\n\nInsofar as the claim that an order had been issued by Mehbooba Mufti that vehicles will not be stopped at checkpoints, The Quint has reported that “(Lt Gen DS) Hooda also said that there was never any government order against “stopping vehicles at check points” following the Budgam incident, as claimed by (Subramaniam) Swamy and other Twitter users.” General Hooda was the then Northern Army Commander.\n\nBakshi’s second claim viz. the jawan who fired at the youths is imprisoned at Tihar jail, is false. Speaking to The Quint, Lt Gen D S Hooda confirmed that the claim about army personnel being court martialed or imprisoned is false.“This all fake news. There was an inquiry that was conducted, but there was no court martial. While we had done our inquiry, a police investigation was ongoing. We wanted to wait till the police completed its investigation, so we could put both the things together and take action on the court of inquiry and police report. But there’s been no court martial.”\n\nThe official Twitter account of Northern Command, Indian Army had reiterated the same in July 2016, affirming that no security personnel were imprisoned or court martialed.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim made by Major General G D Bakshi about Mehbooba Mufti’s alleged role in diluting operating procedures for the army is false. Mufti was not even the CM when the incident of firing had happened. No army men have been imprisoned or court martialed following the incident. Moreover, no order was issued in the first place allowing vehicles to go unchecked.", "rewrites": "Certainly!

Individuals who have recently traveled to China, Iran, Italy and South Korea should also postpone their donations for 28 days, according to the American Red Cross.\n\nHealthy individuals who meet blood donation criteria are eligible and encouraged to give blood, the American Red Cross website states.\n\nCoronavirus tests consist of at least one swab from the nose and one swab from the throat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Such protests swept across the U.S. after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man, while in the custody of a white police officer in Minneapolis.\n\nThe clip is genuine and comes from a 5 1/2-hour Facebook Live video streamed on Simone’s profile. The moment highlighted by Ngo, in which Simone appears to give a gun to a self-identified 18-year-old he does not appear to know, begins at around the 2:08:00 mark. While the CHOP has no formal leader, Simone has been active in “security” operations and in mediating discussions between protesters and the city. Simone’s livestreamed videos from the CHOP have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. In those videos, he can be seen speaking to crowds, to individual protesters, and to city personnel.\n\nAlthough it was shared on June 15, 2020, the video Ngo tweeted took place on the night of June 8, 2020, which was the first night of the CHOP protest. The day before, Nikolas Fernandez drove toward a crowd of protesters and shot one in the arm before fleeing toward the police. That evening, police cleared the protest, which had been blocked from progressing past the Seattle Police East Precinct, using flash bombs and chemical irritants. The next day, with tensions heightened, police removed barriers that had blocked protesters from the East Precinct, secured the building, and gradually removed officers from the area. As described in The Stranger, an alternative bi-weekly newspaper, protesters took the opportunity to occupy the area abandoned by police:\n\nFor several minutes, others in the crowd moseyed around in the intersection, wondering what to do next. Suspicion understandably reigned. Why did the cops decide to pack up their shit and abandon their post? Were they trying to set up the protesters, expecting them to burn the place down to prove a point? Organizers first gathered people to the center of the intersection on 12th and Pine and encouraged the crowd to keep the peace. … They drained water from water barriers and set up a perimeter one block in every direction from the station. Bicycle fencing, cement blocks, and cars formed street barricades. On 11th and Pine, a cardboard sign duct-taped to a barrier read, “You Are Entering Free Capitol Hill.\n\nThe move, according to an explanation from Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan five hours after the fact, was meant to “proactively de-escalate interactions between protestors and law enforcement outside the East Precinct.”\n\nBut the first night in “Free Capitol Hill,” while peaceful, was characterized by paranoia. In an unexpected development, protesters were now — in their eyes — responsible for their own security, and a rumor developed that members of the right-wing group Proud Boys were going to move into the protest area to set fires and stir chaos.\n\nSimone repeatedly refers to this rumor with other protesters in the five-hour long video shot that night, and the moment highlighted in the Ngo video stemmed from a (false) report of Proud Boys gathering at one of the barricades.\n\nIn sum, because the video is from Simone’s own Facebook Live stream, we rank the claim that a video shows him distributing a rifle from the trunk of his car as “True.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Video shows Raz Simone handing over a long rifle to another person in Seattle's BLM zone, with claims of widespread weapons and drugs! 😱\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you hear?

India’s ranking has been much talked about, with several media outlets and members of the Opposition criticising the present government for the drop in the country’s ranking. In 2014, they claimed, India stood at 55.\n\nNDTVreported about India’s GHI ranking in an article titled – “Modi government lagging behind Manmohan government in eradicating hunger; in five years ranking plunges from 55 to 103 (translated).” Dainik Bhaskarpublished a similar report titled – “Hunger in India: Modi government completely fails in this regard, country reaches 103rd position from 55th in four years, even Nepal and Bangladesh ahead of us (translated).”\n\nAnother media portal Go Newsalso presented India’s ranking in a similar fashion. Its tweet drew over 300 retweets.\n\nOther outlets that reported India’s purported plunge from 55 to 103 in the last four years were Lokmat, Khabarbarand Newsfolo.\n\nCongress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted the Dainik Bhaskar report before-mentioned in this article. His tweet was liked over 12,000 times and retweeted more than 4,000 times in less than six hours.\n\nSeveral other Congress members also criticised the government for India’s fall in the rank since 2014. Among them were Indian Youth Congress President Keshav Chand Yadav, AICC Secretary Biswaranjan Mohanty, former MP Subodh Kant Sahai and ex-social media co-ordinator for INC Gaurav Pandhi.\n\nIndia’s rank in 2014 was 99, not 55 ‏\n\nAlt News studied the GHI reports of the years 2014-2018. At first sight, the reports indicated India’s rankings as 55 in 2014, 80 in 2015, 97 in 2016 and 100 in 2017. However, a closer look at the reports prior to 2016 showed that they included an additional table next to the main table which tabulated all countries which had GHI index less than 5. Only those which had a GHI index more than 5 were tabulated in the main table. A lower GHI score implies better performance.\n\nThe screenshot below is the 2014 GHI report and here, 44 countries are included in the additional table. This was reported by Alt News last year as well.\n\nThe 2015 GHI report has a similar table with 13 countries. However, since 2016, the reports included the countries with GHI index less than 5 in the main table thus causing a shift in the rankings. The image below is part of the 2018 GHI report. The highlighted portion on the top of the table are the 15 countries which have GHI index less than 5 and these are included in the main table.\n\nFor the year 2014, the GHI report included a table consisting of 44 countries with GHI index less than 5. In 2015, this number was 13. Thus the correct absolute ranking of a country in the years prior to 2016 would be calculated by adding the rank in the main table and the count of the countries whose GHI is less than 5. According to the above formula, India’s GHI rank was 99 (55+44) in 2014 and 93 (80+13) in 2015. This implies that India’s ranking has plunged by four since 2014.\n\nIndia stood at the 100th position last year (GHI score 31.4) and has fallen three places this year with the 103rd rank (GHI score 31.1) however, there is a slight improvement in the score (0.3 points) since 2017. With a current score of 31.1, India suffers from a level of hunger that is ‘serious’.\n\nAnother point worth noting is the revised formula for calculating GHI score which was introduced in 2015. “The revision replaces child underweight, previously the sole indicator of child undernutrition, with two indicators of child undernutrition—child wasting and child stunting—which are equally weighted in the GHI calculation,” reads the International Food Policy Research Institute website. This explains the huge drop in the number of countries with GHI scores less than 5 from 2014 (44 countries) to 2015 (13 countries). This could also be the probable explanation for the fall in India’s ranking from 55 to 80 from 2014 to 2015.\n\nHowever, GHI rank isn’t the sole factor that determines a country’s performance as the rank may plunge even with improved scores. India’s score in 2017 was 31.4 and its current score is 31.1. Even with the 0.3 point improvement, India’s rank came down three places. This can be attributed to various factors, including a better performance by other countries.\n\nThe most significant aspect that needs to mentioned here is that GHI ranks/ scores are based on a plethora of factors and comparison of year-by-year performance does not arrive at an accurate conclusion. Global Hunger Index itself clarifies in its reports that “rankings cannot be accurately compared with rankings and index scores from previous reports.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking: India's #HungerIndex rank plummets to 103 out of 119 countries in the 2018 Global Hunger Index! 🇮🇳 Meanwhile, it was reportedly 55 back in 2014.

Using optimistic imagery and themes to argue that the country was on the right track after the crises of the 1970s, the ad set the tone for Reagan’s landslide reelection victory.\n\nBy contrast, the Lincoln Project’s ad, retitled \"Mourning in America,\" is replete with depressing footage of masked Americans and economic devastation. And it directly blames Trump for acting ineffectively on the health and economic fronts.\n\nAt one point, the ad asserts, \"Trump bailed out Wall Street, but not Main Street.\"\n\nTrump tweeted his displeasure with the ad, ironically producing a banner fundraising day for the Lincoln Project.\n\nBut is the ad’s claim about bailouts accurate?\n\nWhile there have been high-profile examples of larger corporations being awarded loans from a primarily small-business lending program (and sometimes giving them back), this line in the ad is inaccurate.\n\nMarc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, has been tracking the federal response to the coronavirus-driven economic downturn. He said the dichotomy in the ad is wrong.\n\nThe coronavirus relief legislation passed so far, Goldwein said, \"generally bails out everyone.\"\n\nWe should start by noting that Trump wouldn’t be solely at fault for any design flaws in the primary law for coronavirus relief, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act.\n\nThe $2.2 trillion act, which Trump signed into law on March 27, 2020, included stimulus payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small businesses, and other relief measures. However, before it got to Trump’s desk, the bill had the support of both parties. It passed the Senate unanimously, and it passed the House overwhelmingly.\n\nThe primary way the bill helps small companies is through the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nUnder that program, small businesses can take out federally backed loans through banks or credit unions to tide them through the coronavirus pandemic. The government will forgive the loans if the company keeps all of their employees on the payroll for eight weeks, and as long as the money is used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest, or utilities.\n\nThe Paycheck Protection Program attracted negative media attention when some larger employers, such as Shake Shack, secured small business loans. Criticism grew as the program ran out of money allocated under the CARES Act. Congress later provided funds for additional loans.\n\nThe Shake Shack loan appears to have been legal, since the program allowed loans for businesses in the food services sector that have more than one physical location and employ less than 500 people per location. Still, the negative attention led some of these businesses, including Shake Shack, to voluntarily give back their loans.\n\nWhat does the data show?\n\nThe Small Business Administration, which is overseeing the program, has produced some broad breakdowns of how the first $342 billion in loan money was spent.\n\nFor assessing the ad’s claim, the most problematic cut of the SBA data concerns the size of the loans made so far.\n\nThe breakdown shows that slightly more than 74% of the individual loans granted were for $150,000 or less, totaling $58 billion. Because most companies apply for the maximum amount allowable, and because the loans are capped at 10 weeks of payroll costs, a loan of this size is consistent with a company that has roughly seven to 10 workers, Goldwein said. (Because the individual loan amounts in this category were small, the sum of all these loans was equal to only 17% of the total money spent.)\n\nFurther evidence that the loans are reaching smaller companies comes from a survey released May 5 by the National Federation of Independent Business, a leading small-business group.\n\nThis survey found that 77% of the group’s small business-owner members have successfully submitted an application, and about 61% of those applicants had already received their loans. Others were still in process.\n\nSo contrary to what the ad argues, tens of billions of dollars are flowing to small businesses.\n\nThe public’s aversion to rescuing Wall Street dates back to the Great Recession in 2008, which, unlike the coronavirus downturn, was sparked by a meltdown specifically of the financial sector. The first big bill to address it, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, was designed primarily to help ailing banks, credit markets, and other financial institutions. Another early action was to rescue the government-chartered home mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nThis initial legislation bailed out the financial services sector, rather than economically stressed ordinary Americans. Since then, complaints about lawmakers favoring \"Wall Street\" have persisted for more than a decade, from the Occupy Wall Street movement to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ insurgent presidential campaigns. As recently as a few months ago, Sanders, in his second presidential bid, was regularly assailing federal assistance to Wall Street firms.\n\nThe Paycheck Protection Program does not put any special emphasis on aiding financial firms, although most of the big \"Wall Street\" players would be too big to qualify. In addition, after the bill was passed, regulations were implemented to bar private equity firms from benefiting from the program.\n\nIf a financial company is small enough, from community banks or credit unions to insurance broker firms, it could qualify for a loan under the program. In fact, the SBA data shows that the \"finance and insurance\" sector received 2.39% of the dollars loaned under the program.\n\nStill, that’s well down the list of sectors being served by loans. The biggest recipients were companies in construction (13.12%), professional, scientific, and technical services (12.65%), manufacturing (11.96%), and health care and social assistance (11.65%).\n\nAnother way banks and credit unions can benefit from the Paycheck Protection Program is by servicing the program’s loans to small businesses.\n\nWhen lenders make a loan under the program, the government pays them a fee. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the total administrative costs of the first $349 billion loan tranche was $7.6 billion. Much of that probably went to financial institutions, some of them big players of the kind critics have targeted. However, it’s worth noting that this was not a \"bailout\" but rather a fee for services rendered.\n\nProbably the closest the relief legislation has come to a \"bailout\" of Wall Street comes from a separate part of the law, and its impact has been indirect.\n\nThe CARES Act provides the Federal Reserve with $454 billion in emergency lending authority. This is designed to provide liquidity to the financial system to aid eligible businesses, states and municipalities.\n\nSo while much of this aid will flow through banks, it was not created with bailing out Wall Street as its endpoint; Wall Street is being enlisted to aid a wide range of companies within the U.S. economy.\n\nOf course, some of this support will be used to help bigger companies, and this has probably helped the stock market recover some of its initial losses from the pandemic, Goldwein said. In turn, a healthier stock market does help \"Wall Street.\" But this is an indirect benefit.\n\nThe Lincoln Project did not get back to us with support for the claim; nor did the White House or the Trump campaign. (Editor's note: We received a response from the Lincoln Project after publication; their response is included after our ruling.) The Trump campaign issued a news release on May 6 that cited the 74% figure from the SBA as well as a tweet from White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany saying that 1 million businesses with 10 or fewer employees received Paycheck Protection Program loans in the first round.\n\nThe Lincoln Project ad says, \"Trump bailed out Wall Street, but not Main Street.\"\n\nThis is wrong on several levels. First, Trump doesn’t solely get the credit, or the blame, for anything in the CARES Act; it was supported by virtually all congressional Democrats as well.\n\nThe financial firms criticized for benefiting from the Great Recession bailouts do receive some ancillary benefits from the act, but the loan-accepting companies are the primary target of such largesse, not the banks.\n\nThe clearest problem with the claim is the notion in the ad that \"Main Street\" is not being aided. About three-quarters of the loans in the Paycheck Protection Program were made in the smallest loan size category, one that would support a business of roughly seven to 10 people.\n\nUPDATE: After publication, we received the following response from the Lincoln Project. Our key findings still stand, and the rating remains False.\n\n\"We base that claim on the following Meriam Webster remarks about Wall St: 'In popular culture \"Wall Street\" stands in contrast to \"Main Street.\" While Wall Street is used to describe the capital markets and the financial industry, Main Street is typically used to describe the larger economy in which the vast majority of people live and work.'\n\n \n\n \"Charlie Gasparino, the senior correspondent at Fox Business Network, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post, 'These measures will almost certainly benefit Wall Street and market speculation — even as their impact on Main Street will be slow to come.' He also wrote, 'Wall Street traders will make money, while Main Street businesses face economic conditions not seen since the Great Depression.'\n\n\"Private equity, one of the largest sectors of the financial industry, is looking to cash in on COVID-19 relief money. According to an article from Vanity Fair, 'Among those angling for a federal handout is one of the wealthiest sectors of the American economy: private equity. These firms not only have a record $1.5 trillion in cash on the sidelines, waiting to be invested, but their CEOs are among America’s richest executives. So why should they be permitted to raid the federal Treasury in a time of crisis?'\"", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Unbelievable!

The New York Times, which published the op-ed, described the author as “a senior official in the Trump administration whose identity is known to us and whose job would be jeopardized by its disclosure.”\n\nIt prompted several administration insiders to issue statements denying they had written it, and President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call the writer “gutless” and urge the newspaper to reveal his or her identity.\n\nThe writer’s identity still has not been publicly divulged.\n\nTrumpbetrayed.us, a website that describes its mission as provoking conservatives, has now capitalized on the mystery to claim: “White House ‘Resistance’ Mole a Fake – NY Times Admits They Were Trolled.”\n\nEven though the story was written as a spoof, at least three other websites copied it and presented it as though it were legitimate news.

Pandit’s tweet came after JNU ABVP members alleged violence by students associated with Left-affiliated bodies. The highlighted text in the Facebook post reads, “We are planning to move into phase 2, and work on a flash mob strategy used by Hong Kong, and spread it across cities.”\n\nThe complete Facebook post informs about Shaheen Bagh coordination committee calling off the 20 day-long blockades in the area and remodelling the protests around individual agitations.

Multiple Twitter users have circulated the same claim.\n\nChayan Chatterjee, grandson of Ashutosh Mukherjee, also shared the video with the false claim.\n\nAlt News found that Pandit’s claim about Khan ‘masterminding’ the attack on JNU is false. Afzal Husain Khan was formerly associated with the All India Students Association (AISA). Khan edited his post after it went viral to clearly state what ‘phase 2’ meant, “We are planning to move into Okhla Phase 2. Please share it as much as possible,” the post now reads.\n\nAlt News contacted Afzal Husain Khan who denied having any association with the Shaheen Bagh coordination committee and said that he was merely sharing the statement posted by Sharjeel Imam, one of the organizers of anti-CAA protests at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh.\n\n“I just shared the statement regarding calling off of the Shaheen Bagh road blockade. It was shared in multiple WhatsApp groups and on Facebook as well. Actually there was much confusion among people regarding the call-off. So I took to FB and shared the same.

I’m being framed by an FB post that has nothing to do with any kind of violence,” Khan said.\n\nRefuting the claim of his arrest, he added, “On Twitter “History of India” claimed that I have been arrested, this is worrisome, my family members, friends and well-wishers are deeply concerned for my safety.” According to media reports, arrests for the January 5-6 violence are yet to be made. Delhi police has however filed an FIR against JNUSU president Aishee Ghosh and named 19 others for “attacking security guards and vandalizing server room on January 4.”\n\nKhan’s post reads the same as Imam’s who had shared the information earlier.\n\nImam’s statement about using “flash mob strategy” was also reported by mainstream media outlets like India Today, Outlook and The Finiancial Express on January 2, 2019.\n\nWhat was the flash mob strategy used in the Hong Kong protests?\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong adopted a “be water” strategy where demonstrators pop-up in different locations to catch the authorities flat-footed.

Pandit has been found sharing multiple instances of misinformation around the JNU violence. The filmmaker had falsely claimed that SFI activist Soori Krishnan faked injuries sustained in the attack.

But NHS Digital, which collects the figures, doesn’t know the extent of that double counting and the figure doesn’t factor in how many of these registrations will be from people who only stayed for a short period.\n\nAnd it doesn’t come from the Lancet, it comes from data collected by NHS Digital and published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nWho is counted in that 6.5 million?\n\nThere were 6.5 million GP registrations between 2007 and 2017 in England and Wales, where the person’s previous address was recorded as being outside of the UK and it was the first time they were registering for a GP here.\n\nBut those records don’t always accurately show whether someone’s previous address was outside the UK.\n\nThe records of these GP registrations have something called a “flag 4” attached. That is intended to mean the person signing up to the GP surgery was previously living overseas. For example they may have been born outside of the UK, entered England or Wales for the first time and then registered at an NHS GP. Similar information is collected in Northern Ireland but data for Scotland is unavailable.\n\nNHS Digital told us that until March 2016, “it was possible for a patient to be registered in one area as flag 4 then move to another area and be registered again as a flag 4”, so migrants who moved around may have been double counted.\n\nNHS Digital also told us that until 2016 if a UK citizen had left the UK for more than three months then came back and registered with a new GP in England and Wales, they would also be counted as a flag 4.\n\nThe ONS says: “A person may register with a GP if they are staying in the UK for at least three months and so flag 4s may include some short-term migrants, which are not included in the population estimates.” Short-term migration is defined as between a three and 12 month stay for work or study.\n\nBecause of that, this measure is not a very good way of finding out how much the population has grown because of immigration.\n\nOther measures suggest fewer than 6.5 million people have migrated here for the long-term between 2007 and 2017\n\nLooking at long-term migration, if you add up the difference between the estimated number of non-British people who arrived in or left the UK in the ten years ending June 2018, it’s about three million. Although because of issues with the data up to 2011, that figure is likely to be an underestimate.\n\nThis is a completely different measure to GP registrations, and looks at a larger area (the UK, rather than England and Wales) and a slightly different time period (the ten years up to June 2018 rather than the ten years up to 2017), than the GP registrations figure did.\n\nWe’ve not counted short-term migration in that, because each year more short-term visits are made from the UK abroad than to England and Wales. That’s been the case since at least 2004.\n\nA different measure also makes the 6.5 million figure look too steep. Looking at the UK population by nationality, the number of non-British residents has grown by an estimated 2.2 million between 2007 and 2017. This figure comes from a survey of UK households, and there’s also reason to think this may be a slight underestimate.\n\nWhere did the link to the Lancet come from?\n\nThe 6.5 million figure has nothing to do with the Lancet medical journal. We think the confusion comes from a misunderstanding about a tweet from Migration Watch last year. The tweet said: “The decade 2007-17 saw almost 6.5 million new migrant GP registrations. The Lancet medical journal reported (2016) that, \"English primary care as currently delivered could be reaching saturation point.\" The correlation is clear. This level of immigration is unsustainable”.\n\nOther Twitter users later said that the 6.5 million figure came from the Lancet, which is incorrect.\n\nMigration Watch were quoting an article published in the Lancet about the workload of GPs and nurses in England, which doesn’t mention migrants.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: 6.5 million migrants possibly registered at GP practices in the UK over the past decade, according to data!\nRewritten Tweet 2: Unbelievable! 6.5 million migrant GP registrations reported across the UK in just ten years! 🇬🇧📊\nRewritten Tweet 3: Some suggest 6.5 million migrants registered with GPs in the UK in only a decade.

In 2014 it was 89%, by 2016 it was 98%.\n\nThe types of services offered vary a lot, from big teams offering 24 hour care to much smaller ones running in working hours.\n\nMore than half of services are 24/7, and liaison teams are becoming better staffed overall. Only 12% offer at least what are called ‘Core 24’ standards of care, which requires 25 staff, including two consultants and 13 nurses. The target is for half of NHS hospitals to provide this kind of care by 2021.\n\nExperts do say that liaison services can play a role in reducing suicides, so it’s possible that more liaison services may have contributed to the 6% drop in the suicide rate. But it’s a big ‘may’: there’s no direct evidence either way, suicide rates don’t tie neatly to individual years, and the rates tend to fluctuate from year to year anyway.\n\nLiaison psychiatry is one form of crisis mental health care available.\n\nThe mental health charity Mind describes a crisis as when a person’s mental health is at ‘breaking point’, and they are experiencing symptoms such as suicidal feelings, self-harm, and extreme anxiety.\n\nLiaison services provide mental health care to people with urgent needs arriving in A&E, and who need mental health treatment alongside physical treatment in hospitals.\n\nThere are different models of liaison psychiatry. The Royal College of Psychiatrists specifies how many members of staff a hospital needs for each model.\n\nCore: Service during working or extended hours. 14 whole time equivalent (WTE) staff, including 2 consultants and 8 nurses.\n\nEnhanced 24: 24/7, with more specialist care, offering enhanced expertise in addictions and drug and alcohol use, and mental health problems in people with learning disabilities. 22-24 WTE staff, including 4 consultants and 10 nurses.\n\nComprehensive: 24/7, with inpatient and outpatient services to specialities at major centres. 69 staff, including 5 consultants and 29 nurses.\n\nAnother form of crisis mental health care is a ‘Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment’ team. These teams offer patients intensive treatment at home.\n\nNHS England’s Five Year Forward View for Mental Health was produced in 2016, and includes two recommendations for mental health crisis care.\n\nOne says that community-based mental health crisis care should be available across England by 2020/21, and that crisis resolution and home treatment teams should be expanded.\n\nThe other says that by 2020/21 each acute hospital should have mental health liaison services in emergency departments and inpatient wards. At least half of these should meet at least core 24 service standards. The government accepted all the recommendations at the start of 2017.\n\nJeremy Hunt has used data from a 2016 survey of psychiatric liaison, run by academics from Plymouth University, in association with NHS England and Health Education England.\n\nIn 2014, 89% of A&Es in England had a psychiatric liaison service, compared to 98% in 2016. 95% of hospitals with A&E departments returned data in 2014 and 98% did in 2016.\n\nMost of those services fall below the ‘core’ service model outlined above though, although an increasing number are meeting this standard. 14% of departments were at least the core standard in 2014, rising to 27% in 2016.\n\nWhere some kind of psychiatric liaison service was available, just over half of the services were available 24/7. That’s risen from 50% of them in 2015 to 55% in 2016. But only 12% met the criteria of ‘core 24’ or ‘enhanced 24’.\n\nNHS England’s mental health strategy says that “the peak hours for mental health crisis presentations to A&E are between 11pm and 7am”.\n\nThe suicide rate fell between 2015 and 2016, but we don’t know much about the impact that liaison services have\n\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists says that liaison services “can reduce the risk of self-harm and suicide”.\n\nSelf-harm is reported as the main reason for A&E referrals to the liaison service, according to a study by the Centre for Mental Health charity. Using a publication from the Royal College of Physicians, they say that half of all suicides have a history of self-harm, so mental health treatment for self-harm could help to prevent suicide.\n\nBut they also explain that: “little is known about the impact of liaison psychiatry services on the number of achieved suicides, mainly because suicide is a relatively rare event”.\n\nThe suicide rate in England fell from 10.1 per 100,000 people in 2015 to 9.5 in 2016—a fall of 6% and the lowest since 2010. The number of suicides registered in England fell from 4820 to 4575 in 2016.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) points out that deaths by suicide in England and Wales can only be registered following an inquest, which can take months or even years. This means that not all of the deaths reported in these figures will necessarily have happened in 2016. Some may have happened in 2015 or even years earlier. Similarly there will be deaths in 2016 which may not yet have been registered, as an inquest wasn’t complete by the end of the year.\n\nIn Great Britain the rate fell from 10.6 to 10.1 per 100,000—a fall of 5%.\n\nThe government has pledged to invest in mental health\n\nIn January 2016, the Prime Minister at the time, David Cameron, promised nearly £250 million to place mental health services in every A&E, and over £400 million for crisis home resolution teams. This was followed by pledges to make intensive home treatment available across the country and mental health liaison in place in all A&Es by 2020.\n\nNHS England has set up a dashboard monitoring progress towards the Five Year Forward View goals, including indicators for crisis care spending.

It is after June 15 that fishing starts. Hundreds of trawlers go out into the Bay of Bengal for fishing. This particular incident took place on July 6 at around 7 pm when these trawlers were returning from Haribhanga Char which is in Bangladesh waters.\n\nThere were 61 fishermen on board the four trawlers that drowned in the sea that evening.

In one picture it appears he is kicking someone who is face-down on the ground wearing a blue shirt and light blue jeans. \"This man who was kicked and stomped has died,\" the post claims. \"The antifa murderer is in the white mask.\" It then calls for anyone who recognizes the man to call the police or the FBI.\n\nThis post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis attack did happen, and the victim was seriously injured. But police confirmed that he survived, and said they had arrested a teenage suspect. There is no evidence that the person attacking him is part of antifa, a loosely organized left-wing movement that at times uses violence.\n\nThis attack happened on May 30 in Portland, Ore., at the intersection of SW 4th Street and SW Salmon Street, where journalists photographed protests against police brutality around 8 p.m.\n\nBased on a review of images and videos tweeted and shared by journalists, it appears that the victim seen lying on the ground in these photos was involved in a skirmish immediately prior to what we see in this Facebook post. And videos also show that after these pictures were taken, he was able to stand and speak to others who came to his aid.\n\nIn a video posted by a journalist from the Oregonian newspaper, a large crowd is seen attacking a man with a flag. Twenty-eight seconds in, we see the man in the blue shirt and light blue jeans run into the melee and become involved in the conflict with his arms swinging. In a separate video of the same incident captured by another Oregonian journalist from a different angle, it looks like the man is punching and pushing someone before exiting the crowd again.\n\nAs the man walks from the scene, according to a third video tweeted by conservative journalist Andy Ngo, two men start chasing him. One pushes him, and the man in blue collapses face-down. Then another man, wearing a black T-shirt, kicks him in the head before fleeing. \"He’s dead,\" we hear someone yell.\n\nBut as the video continues, we see others come to the man’s aid, treating his wounds, helping him off the ground and talking to him.\n\nNgo, of conservative Canadian website The Post Millennial, on May 31 posted a compilation of pictures similar to those seen in the Facebook post and identified the attackers as \"antifa.\"\n\nOn June 4, Portland police announced that with \"the public's help, the suspect who was kicking the victim in the head was identified and detectives were notified.\" The 14-year-old suspect was charged with felony assault and taken to a juvenile detention center, while the investigation continues.\n\nPortland police said in their statement that \"the male victim sustained serious injuries but is not deceased.\" Sgt. Michael Roberts told PolitiFact that the police currently have no evidence of antifa being involved in this incident.\n\nA Facebook post claimed that an \"antifa murderer\" had killed a man that \"was kicked and stomped\" at a protest.\n\nThere is no evidence that the attackers are part of the antifa movement. The attack took place where many were peacefully protesting the Minneapolis police’s treatment of George Floyd.\n\nAccording to videos of the attack from journalists at the protest, the man in the blue shirt got up after the attack and was walking around and talking.

The two photos circulating do not show the officer, Derek Chauvin.\n\nThe death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, following his arrest on May 25 has prompted uproar and protests in the city’s streets.\n\nFloyd, a black man, died shortly after he was detained by officers. A video of the arrest emerged in which Floyd can be heard repeatedly saying, “I cannot breathe,” as an officer kneels on his neck for several minutes. The Minneapolis Police Department has confirmed in a statement that the FBI will investigate, and the city’s mayor said that the “four responding MPD officers involved in the death of George Floyd have been terminated.”\n\nBut the furor online has at times been accompanied by politically charged misinformation about the officer at the center of the case, Derek Chauvin — who was identified in news reports as the officer seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck.\n\nViral posts on Facebook and Twitter have falsely claimed that two different photos, of two different men, show Chauvin. They don’t.\n\nIn one case, a photo of a man whom social media users purported to be Chauvin is seen wearing a red hat reading, “Make Whites Great Again.”\n\n“Does this surprise any of you?” reads one Facebook meme showing the picture alongside a screenshot of Chauvin from the video of Floyd’s arrest. The rapper Ice Cube also shared the two photos side by side on Twitter, writing: “A wolf in wolves clothing. The demons are among us. #Fightthecowards.” His tweet was shared more than 50,000 times.\n\nThe man in the hat, however, is not Chauvin. The man was later identified by HuffPost reporter Luke O’Brien as Jonathan Lee Riches, who is known for his penchant for filing lawsuits. O’Brien profiled Riches in a 2019 story.\n\nRiches has “filed thousands of actions in federal courts throughout the country, most of which have been dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,” a Montana federal judge wrote while dismissing a 2016 complaint he filed against then-candidate Donald Trump. In that complaint, Riches said he supported Trump “100%” and “I love Donald Trump like a brother/father,” but sought an order to stop him from running for president because he feared for Trump’s safety.\n\nThe HuffPost story on Riches detailed his “trolling” practices, including setting up fake social media accounts.\n\nThe photo of Riches was posted on a since-deactivated Facebook account under the name “Derek Chauvin” on May 26, one day after Floyd’s death, with a caption “Better times.” That profile is no longer active.\n\nWe reached out through Riches’ Facebook profile directly for comment and didn’t hear back. But an account connected to his — one for “Joseph A Camp” — which spent the day May 27 posting about the viral photo and the news coverage it spawned did get back to us. (The Camp and Riches profiles list one another as a domestic partner on Facebook, though Camp said they are not actually in a domestic partnership.)\n\nCamp said in a message: “JLR(c) and I are political satirical artist who are both well known for massive controversial satire” and that “JLR(c) is the individual in the image.” He claimed the hat in the viral image had been photoshopped — though he couldn’t provide an original photo to support that claim.\n\nWe asked whether Riches created the “Derek Chauvin” account that posted the photo, and Camp said: “I can’t confirm or deny if JLR(c) created the account in question, but I will confirm that Mr. Riches has been accused or assumed to have created massive social media profiles, groups, and pages in an attempt to use satire to prove a point.”\n\nSeparately, another viral photo shows an arrow pointing at a man at a Trump rally, and appeared with captions identifying the man as Chauvin. The rally photo was taken at an October 2019 campaign rally in Minneapolis and shows attendees wearing shirts reading, “Cops for Trump.”\n\nBut Minneapolis Police Lt. Bob Kroll, president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis who is also seen in the photo, told the Associated Press that “none of the officers in the [George Floyd] incident were near the Trump rally.” He said the individual in the rally photo is actually Michael Gallagher, president of the Bloomington Police Officers Federation.\n\nKroll and Gallagher didn’t return our requests for comment.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

This was after a CCTV video of police charging students with lathis inside a reading room went massively viral. The footage was handed over to the channel by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Delhi police. It was played as ‘authentic’ clip and used to claim that students entered the reading room with stones in their hands.\n\nA plethora of other news organisations carried the clip and claimed that the students had stones clasped in their hands. Among the English outlets were Times of India, Mirror Now, Republic Bharat, Times Now, The Quint and DNA. Some of the Hindi channels were Zee News, Aaj Tak, India TV, NDTV Indiaand News Nation.\n\nThe channel claimed that the student was carrying a stone each in both his hands. For the purpose of this fact-check, Alt News used a higher resolution video received from sources in Jamia. The video is of the same footage played by India Today. Alt News slowed down the video and watched it frame-by-frame. We found that the student was holding a wallet in one of his hands, and a flat object (possibly a phone) in the other.\n\nHere is the sequence of events – the student enters the room with a wallet in his right hand and a linear object (possibly a phone) in his left hand. At about 10 seconds, he goes out of the frame and comes back at 17 seconds when his right hand is empty. The brown wallet is now visible in his left hand.\n\nThe wallet is visible in multiple frames, however, is most clear at the 1:22-minute mark when the student stretches out his arm.\n\nAnother clear shot of the wallet can be seen at 2:27. If one notices carefully, the two brown flaps of the wallet are distinctly noticeable and the gap in between is darker – a shade of black.\n\nThe student holds a flat object in his other hand which could possibly be a mobile phone. It isn’t as distinctly noticeable as the wallet and users are advised to watch the complete video in loops to self-analyse. We will attempt to provide a clean screenshot however there are a few pointers worth mentioning – a stone would typically be irregularly shaped. The object held in his hand is symmetrical and flat.\n\nThe video below shows the linear symmetry of the object held in his left hand.\n\nMedia outlets therefore jumped to the police’s defence without a basic internal analysis.

Some Democrats have correctly said Trump “tried” to implement such cuts, while others wrongly claimed he “slashed funding of the CDC” or “cut the funding,” in the words of Democratic presidential candidates Mike Bloomberg and Joe Biden, respectively.\n• Biden said Trump “tried to defund the NIH.” Trump did propose cutting NIH funding, but lawmakers instead have enacted increases.\n• None Multiple Democrats, including Bloomberg and Biden, have criticized Trump for getting rid of a pandemic response position on the National Security Council. The position was eliminated, although John Bolton, then-national security adviser, was the person directly responsible.\n• Biden went too far when he claimed that Trump “hasn’t allowed his scientists to speak” about the coronavirus.

On ABC’s “This Week” on March 1, Biden said: “They’ve cut the funding for the CDC.”\n\n“And he has defunded — he had defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don’t have the organization we need,” former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg said in the Feb. 25 debate. In a statement issued the same day, Bloomberg said Trump “has slashed funding of the CDC and other essential health agencies.”\n\nAs we’ve written before, a president’s budget proposal is more a statement of priorities than anything Congress would vote to enact. In fact, Republican Sen. Mike Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that he wouldn’t hold a hearing on Trump’s latest fiscal 2021 budget, adding, “Congress doesn’t pay any attention to the president’s budget exercise.”\n\nDara Lieberman, director of government relations for the nonprofit, nonpartisan Trust for America’s Health, told us: “The administration has proposed, but Congress has for the large part rejected, cuts to … CDC’s budget.”\n\nDemocrats are free to criticize the president’s proposals, and they have. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Feb. 27 news conference: “The Trump budget called for slashing almost $700 million from the Center for Disease Control, and this was the budget which came out after we knew about the coronavirus threat.”\n\nThe fiscal 2021 budget proposal did call for a $693.3 million reduction to the CDC’s funding compared with what was enacted for fiscal 2020, according to this CDC budget document. That would be a 9% reduction in the CDC’s budget. The president’s budget proposal was released on Feb. 10, after the COVID-19 outbreak began and the first U.S. case was confirmed on Jan. 20.\n\nBut the president has proposed cuts to the CDC in past budgets that Congress did not enact. It’s misleading at best to claim Trump “slashed funding,” when his proposals haven’t taken effect. For instance, Trump’s fiscal 2020 budget proposal would have reduced CDC funding by $750.6 million, compared with what was enacted for fiscal 2019 (see the “program level” line in the linked document). But Congress passed, and Trump signed, a budget that increased CDC funding by $420 million.\n\nFor fiscal 2019, Trump put forth a $1.36 billion cut to CDC’s funding in his budget proposal, but what ended up being enacted was a $261.6 million increase over what was passed the year before. The president proposed a 19.4% reduction, but Congress enacted a 3.7% increase.\n\nFor fiscal 2018, Trump’s first full budget proposal as president, he proposed a 17% reduction in funding for the CDC, but what Congress enacted amounted to a 2.3% drop in funding for the annualized 2018 continuing resolution.\n\nAfter Congress enacts a budget and passes appropriation bills, the CDC creates an operating plan for the funding. Below is a chart of CDC operating plans since fiscal 2016, which ended Sept. 30, 2016, nearly four months before Trump took office. The fiscal 2017 budget would have been enacted under former President Barack Obama; however, Congress passed continuing resolution appropriation bills for that fiscal year after Trump took office.\n\nThe CDC’s operating budgets, not adjusted for inflation, show the CDC funding has gone up a bit under Trump.\n\nThe Trust for America’s Health 2019 report on funding of the public health system includes a chart on CDC funding adjusted for inflation, and that shows a small overall decrease, of $460 million from fiscal 2016 to 2019, or $170 million from fiscal 2017 to 2019. (See Figure 2.) However, that chart notes that a comparison with 2019 funding requires accounting for a transfer of CDC funds to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. After making that adjustment, and another for one-time laboratory funding that boosted the 2018 budget, the report says the CDC had “flat funding in inflation-adjusted dollars” from 2018 to 2019.\n\nThe 2020 CDC operating plan shows an increase from 2019 of 7%, adjusted for inflation, according to the Trust for America’s Health.\n\nOverall, the group’s report says there has been a “chronic underfunding” of the public health system in the U.S., but that began before Trump took office and has continued.\n\nOne area of concern is funding for the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which was created by the Affordable Care Act. The ACA, which said the fund would back “expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs,” set the annual appropriation for the fund at $500 million for fiscal 2010, increasing to $2 billion for 2015 and thereafter. However, Congress, and the secretary of Health and Human Services, has used some of this appropriation for other programs and expenses.\n\nThe PPHF “has been repeatedly cut and used to pay for other legislation,” the Trust for America’s Health report says.\n\nFor instance, in 2013, the HHS secretary used nearly half of the PPHF funding for implemention of the ACA’s insurance marketplace, according to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report. Under Trump, Congress passed, and he signed, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which repeals $1.35 billion in PPHF appropriated funding over 10 years.\n\nThe actual funding for the PPHF has amounted to about half of the $2 billion annually called for in the ACA since 2015, the Trust for America’s Health report shows (see Figure 3). But since that has been the case for several years, the overall CDC funding doesn’t show a cut from year to year.\n\nAs we said, Trump has proposed cuts, every year, to the CDC, but they haven’t been enacted by Congress. In his fiscal 2021 budget, he also proposed reduced funding for global health programs and funding to the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization. The president defended the proposed cuts when asked about them in a Feb. 26 press conference on the coronavirus.\n\n“We can get money and we can increase staff,” Trump said. “We know all the good people. It’s a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years. And if — if we have a need, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money — and I’m a business person — I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly.”\n\nSome experts told the Washington Post that it’s not that easy to staff up quickly during a crisis. Employment at the CDC has declined by 591 positions, or 5.4%, from December 2016 through March 2019, the most recent data available from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nAs for increased funding to respond to the coronavirus, the administration has asked Congress for $2.5 billion, but Democrats said that was too little. Trump said in his press conference: “If they want to give more, we’ll do more.”\n\nThe Biden campaign also pointed to news reports in 2018 that the administration wouldn’t renew expiring funding for the Global Health Security Agenda, a program in which the CDC works with other countries “to strengthen public health systems and reduce the risk of infectious disease outbreaks.” Most of that program’s funding was a one-time, five-year appropriation that was expected to run out at the end of September 2019. But we haven’t been able to confirm to what extent the CDC ended up cutting back on the program. We’ll update this story when we have more information.\n\nBiden also claimed in the CNN town hall that Trump “tried to defund the NIH.” It’s true that Trump’s fiscal 2018 budget proposal called for a reduction in funding for the National Institutes of Health, but Congress instead increased the NIH budget, as several news organizations reported at the time.\n\nSimilarly, Trump’s proposal for fiscal 2020 included reduced funding for NIH, but what Congress enacted was an increase from the previous year.\n\nNumerous Democrats denounced the Trump administration’s coronavirus response by pointing to the disbanding of a team within the White House dedicated to coordinating a response to a pandemic.\n\nBloomberg first drew attention to the move in the Democratic debate in South Carolina.\n\nThe next day in a CNN town hall he mentioned it again, saying, “Number one, he fired the pandemic team two years ago.”\n\nBiden also noted it in a CNN town hall event that aired two hours after Bloomberg’s, and in an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on March 1, he said, “[W]e set up an entire mechanism as to how to deal with future outbreaks of pandemic diseases. They [Trump administration officials] eliminated that office when they came in play.”\n\nThe Trump administration did indeed eliminate a key position that would have been involved in pandemic response.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that former National Security Adviser John Bolton dissolved the NSC’s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense in May 2018 in a reorganization effort. That’s when Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer, who was senior director of the office, left his post. He was not replaced.\n\nAs a report by the bipartisan think tank Center for Strategic & International Studies explains, the Global Health Security and Biodefense directorate “pooled NSC staff focused on domestic and international biodefense and health security issues” and was designed “to plan for and oversee rapid, efficient, government-wide responses to global health security threats.”\n\nPresident Obama had instituted the unit in 2016 following a yearslong Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Trump appointed Ziemer, who had been coordinator of the President’s Malaria Initiative under both President George W. Bush and Obama, to head the office in April 2017.\n\nZiemer departed abruptly a little over a year later just as a new Ebola outbreak was starting in Congo. He now serves as senior deputy assistant administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance at USAID.\n\nTom Bossert, a former White House homeland security adviser who helped develop the administration’s biodefense strategy and was the designated lead for coordinating the American response to a biological crisis, was also reportedly pushed out when Bolton took over. Bossert resigned in April 2018, a day after Bolton started as national security adviser. Three anonymous sources told the Washington Post that Bolton requested his resignation.\n\nContrary to some recent news reports, Bossert was replaced with a series of people, but the job of coordinating a pandemic response does not appear to have followed. When Trump announced his coronavirus task force on Jan. 29, he did not name current homeland security adviser Julia Nesheiwat in any capacity.\n\nJust because Ziemer’s position was discontinued does not mean everyone who was part of the team was fired or that all of the functions of the directorate ceased. According to reporting by the Atlantic and the Washington Post, some team members were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of Ziemer’s duties. An NSC spokesman at the time said that the administration “remains committed to global health, global health security and biodefense, and will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.”\n\nBut the lack of someone in the White House to coordinate the response to a widespread disease outbreak in the U.S. is something numerous experts and groups at the time had cautioned against.\n\nIn a November 2019 report, the Center for Strategic & International Studies recommended restoring the global health security position on the NSC as one of seven key changes to better protect the American public from global health threats.\n\n“It remains unclear who would be in charge at the White House in the case of a grave pandemic threat or cross-border biological crisis,” the report reads, noting that such leadership is “critical in navigating challenging political issues like quarantines and travel bans and in communicating to and reassuring the American public.”\n\n“The authorities currently in place at HHS are insufficient to address these critical, complex, and often urgent interagency demands,” the report continues. “In addition to coordinating the interagency process, a global health security and biodefense directorate at the NSC can reform fragmented programs and ensure higher efficiencies, strengthened accountability, and better spending of scarce resources.”\n\nWe reached out to the White House press office, but we haven’t received any information on the NSC staffing.\n\nBiden went too far when he claimed that Trump is “muzzling” government scientists and “hasn’t allowed his scientists to speak” about the coronavirus.\n\nIt’s true that government scientists were told to clear their public appearances through a newly created coronavirus task force. But scientists, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have since made numerous public appearances to talk about the epidemic.\n\nBiden’s comments stem from a New York Times story on Feb. 27 that said the White House moved “to tighten control of coronavirus messaging by government health officials and scientists, directing them to coordinate all statements and public appearances with the office of Vice President Mike Pence, according to several officials familiar with the new approach.”\n\nThe day before, Trump had tapped Pence to head up the administration’s coronavirus response.\n\nAccording to the Times story, “Dr. Fauci has told associates that the White House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.”\n\nThat led to charges from some Democrats that Trump was attempting to politicize the response to the epidemic after government scientists had contradicted him on several points earlier in the week. (For example, as we wrote, Trump’s claim in a Feb. 26 press conference that the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is “going very substantially down, not up” was contradicted by the CDC, which said to expect more cases. And while Trump said the U.S. “will essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner,” Fauci said a vaccine at best won’t be ready for “a year to a year-and-a-half.”)\n\nA day after the New York Times story was published, Biden alleged during a Feb. 28 CNN interview that “the experts are not allowed to speak, the president has silenced them.”\n\nBiden specifically cited Fauci, who Biden noted has worked for multiple administrations.\n\n“You need to let the experts speak,” Biden said on CNN. “I was told, I heard on the news this morning, Dr. Fauci is not allowed to speak publicly. What is this all about? No one takes the president’s word for these things. At a minimum, he exaggerates everything. And the idea that he’s gonna stand there and say everything’s fine, don’t worry. Who’s gonna believe that? Let the experts speak like we did in our administration.”\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Fauci told lawmakers during a House briefing that day, Feb. 28, that he was not being “gagged” or “muzzled,” though he did cancel appearances on some Sunday talk shows after Pence was tapped to lead the coronavirus response.\n\nAccording to the Post, Fauci told House members “that the change was necessary because such appearances must always be cleared, and the clearance process restarted after Pence was named Wednesday to head the response.”\n\nLater that day, Fauci appeared on MSNBC’s “Hardball with Chris Matthews” and said the situation was “completely misconstrued.” Fauci also was interviewed by Politico that same day, Feb. 28, and he talked about striking a balance between telling the truth and not butting heads with the president.\n\n“You should never destroy your own credibility. And you don’t want to go to war with a president,” Fauci said. “But you got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth.”\n\nThe following day, Feb. 29, Fauci again addressed the controversy in a White House press conference when a reporter asked about reports that he was being “muzzled.”\n\n“So let me clarify,” Fauci said. “I have never been muzzled ever, and I’ve been doing this since the administration of Ronald Reagan. I’m not being muzzled by this administration. What happened — which was misinterpreted — is that we were set up to go on some shows, and when the vice president took over, we said, ‘Let’s regroup and figure out how we’re going to be communicating.’ So I had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance. And when I resubmitted for clearance, I got cleared. So I have not been muzzled at all. That was a real misrepresentation of what happened.”\n\nIn a teleconference after Trump’s press conference, another government scientist, Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, provided further updates on the virus.\n\nNonetheless, Biden continued to press the line of attack that Trump “should let the scientists speak” and that Trump was “muzzling the scientist.”\n\nFauci did not appear on any of the Sunday political talk shows. Instead, Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar went on the shows to talk about the epidemic and the administration’s response. But Fauci and others have continued to speak publicly to the press. For example, Fauci spoke at length about the coronavirus epidemic on CNN’s “New Day” on March 2.\n\nReaders can make what they will of the White House’s decision to centralize its public coronavirus response — which requires government scientists to clear their public appearances through the task force — but government scientists have not been “silenced” or “muzzled.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Eliminating the Global Health Security and Biological Threats directorate from the NSC is an incredibly dangerous move!

It has also been reported that transport minister Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast on 3 July that, from 10 July onward, “you will be legal not to quarantine yourself.”\n\nHowever, guidance published on the government’s official website by the Department for Transport (DfT) says that you must follow the rules that were in place on the date that you arrived in England.

Since this story was published, the FCO has confirmed it has deleted one of the tweets and added corrections linking to the DfT guidance.\n\nThis means you cannot end your quarantine period early if you arrived in England before 10 July. In England, if you do not self-isolate after travelling when you are supposed to, you can be fined £1,000. On Twitter, the FCO said it would not enforce this after 10 July, but guidance on gov.uk makes no mention of this.\n\nGovernment guidance says you must self-isolate for 14 days when arriving in the UK from a country outside of the common travel area (which includes the UK, Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man).\n\nOn 10 July, new travel corridor exemptions came into force for people arriving in England. This means that, if you are arriving in England from certain countries or territories, you will not have to quarantine. This applies to all travel, including air, train, ferry and coach (the FCO still advises against cruise ship travel). If you have visited or made a transit stop in a country that is not on the travel corridor list in the 14 days before your arrival in England, you will still need to self-isolate and check the guidance for how long you should isolate for.\n\nWhen responding to queries about the rules on Twitter, the FCO travel advice account told members of the public that people who have travelled from the exempt countries before 10 July can automatically stop quarantining on that date. In one tweet it incorrectly said someone returning to the UK does not have to quarantine from 10 July, but the travel corridor exemptions only apply to England.

He said, “On one side there was a temple and on the other, a cemetery. In the conflict, both the temple and the cemetery have been damaged. The temple came between the stone-pelting from both the groups.”\n\nAlt News also reached out to Akshay Anand who did a ground report for HS Bihar, a Bihar-based digital news platform. He shared a video which clearly shows a mob attacking a temple in the Phulwari Sharif area. Below is the relevant bit from the video which has been slowed down for viewers to clearly see the attack.\n\n“The Hanuman idol inside the temple was vandalised wherein the idol’s right arm was broken and the face was disfigured. After things settled, the Hanuman idol was covered with a piece of cloth to protect Hindu sentiments,” said Anand. “There was no damage to the structure of the temple but the right side of the door was damaged”, he added. According to the journalist, a majority of the people involved in the conflict were residents of Phulwari Sharif.\n\nTherefore, the claim that a temple was vandalised is true, however, it wasn’t a Shiva temple but dedicated to Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nSHO Rehman told Alt News that the police did not use firearms during the conflict and claimed that the gunshots were made against anti-CAA protesters by members of the Hindu community. According to the Rehman, no deaths have occurred.\n\n“On December 21, around 1 pm, stone-pelting began. While the police were present in the conflict zone, they were drastically outnumbered,” said Anand. “The shooting occurred around 1.15 pm and by 1.30 pm Rapid Action Force (RAF) and armed district police reached the scene. The forces lobbed at least 40 tear-gas shells and used water cannons to disperse the violent mob. By 4 pm, the situation was under control,” he further informed.\n\nAnand also said, “As per my inquiry, no Hindu was shot dead. In fact, the shooting was done by the Hindu community which injured at least nine Muslim men. One of them was shot in the neck and is in a critical condition.”\n\nAlt News reached out to another Patna-based journalist, Sujeet Gupta, who was covering the aftermath of the riots. He said, “I don’t think the objective of the CAA protesters was to destroy the temple. But in the heat of the moment, things escalated.” According to Gupta, violence broke out after Hindus in the locality stopped the protesters from agitating. “Shots were fired at CAA protesters after they started vandalising the temple. The mob opposing the protesters did the shooting,” he informed.\n\nGupta added that the police too made gunshots but only in the air to disperse the mob. He confirmed that no one died as a result of the conflict but some anti-CAA protesters were injured. Expressing concern at the misinformation that a Hindu was shot dead, Gupta said, “Such rumours may cause communal tension. I have seen several posts on social media by young boys who are talking about taking revenge from the other community.”\n\nThus the claim that a Hindu was shot dead is false. Both police and local journalists stated that the conflict saw no casualties.\n\nAnand shared a 44-second video with Alt News where one can spot gunshot victims. While he could not ascertain who shot the clip, he informed that it was taken at Imarat Shariya, a social welfare organisation which operates the Maulana Sajjad Memorial Hospital, commonly known as MSM Hospital.\n\nIn the video, we can spot at least three wounded men and someone in the background can be heard repeatedly saying that police fired the shots.\n\nAlt News spoke with Mohammad Aadil Faridi, the office secretary at Imarat Shariya, who confirmed the location in the video. “Nine people were injured by gunshots. We sent them to AIIMS and PMCH in an ambulance. Two of them were critically injured – one was shot in the neck and the other was shot in his liver. But no one was reported dead in the incident,” he said. According to Faridi, bullets were fired by miscreants from a building’s rooftop on CAA protesters. Similar to Anand’s inputs, Faridi said, “The police did not fire the bullets on the mob. They only shot in the air to disperse the mob.”\n\nAlt News cannot confirm the parties involved in gunshots. However, as per the police, journalists and Imarat Shariya, it is clear that anti-CAA protesters were the ones injured.\n\nA temple was vandalised in Bihar’s Pulwari Sharif when clashes between two groups took a violent turn in the view of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. There were no casualties in the conflict but several people were injured, among whom were nine Muslims who suffered gunshot wounds. The claim that a Hindu was shot dead is untrue. According to a December 23 report in Times of India, at least 40 people have been arrested for the violence. The report also stated that three empty cartridges of 7.65mm were recovered.\n\n[Update: This report, in certain places, identified anti-CAA protesters and the people who retaliated against them as members of the Muslim and Hindu communities respectively.

The identical video was also circulated by national in-charge of social media – BJP Mahila Morcha, Priti Gandhi.\n\nAs it turns out, Malviya and Gandhi shared a mischievously clipped video of the former PM’s speech made on November 26. Singh was a panelist in a discussion organised for the book release function of former Union Minister Manish Tewari’s new book ‘Fables of Fractured Times’. During the dialogue, journalist and anchor Rajdeep Sardesai posed a question to the former PM regarding maintaining dignity and decorum at a time of polarised election propaganda.\n\nResponding to Sardesai, Singh asserted the significance of the Prime Minister maintaining a certain restraint on the use of language when he visits states that are ruled by parties other than the BJP. Singh continued to say that during UPA’s government, he maintained cordial relationships with the governments of both Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh despite the states not being ruled by the Congress.\n\nThe former PM’s exact words were, “My relationships with the government of Madhya Pradesh, the government of Chhattisgarh were very good. We never discriminated against BJP-ruled states.” He further went on to say that MP CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan can testify the same. The relevant part of Singh’s statement starts at 1:20 minutes in the complete video tweeted earlier by Congress.\n\nIn conclusion, former PM Manmohan Singh wasn’t praising BJP governments in MP and Chhatisgarh. He was, in fact, advising Prime Minister Modi to not discriminate against states that aren’t ruled by the BJP, same as he claimed to have practised when in power. This was first pointed out by True News (@TrueNewsBengal). Singh’s original statement “my relationships with the government of Madhya Pradesh, the government of Chhattisgarh were very good” was clipped to “the government of Madhya Pradesh, the government of Chhattisgarh were very good” to make it seem otherwise.\n\nThis wasn’t an isolated instance when BJP IT cell heads circulated cropped videos to portray Congress in poor light. Earlier, Amit Malviya had tweeted a misleading clip of INC MLA Jitu Patwari. He had also shared a clipped video to malign journalist Ravish Kumar.

We’re talking, of course, about new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who took over the Senate’s top slot after the midterm elections bounced Democrats from power.\n\nAnd in this new world, are touting an eye-catching factoid as evidence of a functional Senate, one they say runs on fairness and order under GOP control.\n\n\"Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year,\" tweeted Phil Kerpen, and president of conservative 501(c)(4) American Commitment, on Jan. 22, 2015.\n\nKerpen, formerly of Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth and the libertarian Cato Institute, told us he heard the statistic .\n\nWe wanted to know if it was true that the Senate has already allowed more votes on amendments in less than one month than all of 2014. And why?\n\nThe simple answer on the number of votes is that Kerpen is correct. But the reason behind it varies depending on your particular political lens.\n\nA simple search of Senate roll call votes on amendments and backs up Kerpen’s statement. In 2014, there were 15 roll call votes on amendments. As of Jan. 22, 2015, the date of Kerpen's tweet, there were 16 roll call votes on amendments. There have since been 17 more votes on amendments to the bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which but will likely face President Barack Obama’s veto pen.\n\nKerpen came at the tally a different way, counting \"real\" votes on amendments, a distinction that also includes roll call votes on motions to table amendments, which effectively kills them. By his math, there were 16 votes allowed on amendments in 2014 and 26 so far in 2015. By either count, the numbers work.\n\nIn 2014, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., relied on a funny-sounding procedure called \" \" Basically, Reid filled the docket allowed for amendments by adding amendments with inconsequential changes that no one else could override. The procedural tactic prevented Republican-sponsored amendments from being heard on the floor.\n\n\"He did that more than any of his predecessors,\" Donald Ritchie, Senate historian, told PunditFact.\n\nReid wasn’t doing this just to be a not-so-nice guy. To Democrats, it was to counter Republican tactics. Unlike the House, the Senate does not have strict rules for the substance of amendments that can be attached to bills (i.e., you could add a health care amendment onto a defense spending bill).\n\nAnd that’s exactly what happened in years past. Republicans began introducing off-topic amendments that, for example, cut off U.S. aid to Egypt or, a favorite of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to eliminate health care subsidies for Senate staffers. No matter what the topic of the bill. Sometimes this was in effort to force difficult votes for Democrats back home.\n\nTo Republicans, Reid’s style of blocking amendments emulated an uncooperative and off-the-rails leadership style -- one that is tremendously well-documented -- that stymied policymaking.\n\nTo Democrats, it was necessary to get anything accomplished. Republicans were filibustering votes on the underlying bills and not committing to a vote in exchange for allowing some amendments, said Steven S. Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n\"Reid saw they were filibustering everything, bringing the place to a standstill,\" Smith told us. \"So he wondered why he should give them votes at all.\"\n\nReid’s office does not dispute the number of votes on amendments, but they do take issue with what they deem an \"empty talking point\" that neglects Republican responsibility for the gridlock. His spokesman their own share of amendments by not compromising on potential amendments to be heard on the floor and refusing to come to an agreement about when a bill should come to a vote.\n\n\"(Reid) makes no apologies for blocking what we all consider to be extremely pointless political amendments that were just designed not to improve the bills we were working on but to run 30-second political ads against Democratic senators,\" said spokesman Adam Jentleson. \"Republicans are entirely culpable in that number being what it is.\"\n\nReid’s style of blocking amendments irritated Republicans, sure, but it also flared up during the 2014 midterms with Republicans using it to attack Democrats. The GOP pounced on Alaska Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Begich, for instance, for his lack of roll-call votes on his amendments .\n\nMcConnell, conversely, said he would allow open amendments on the Keystone XL bill, hence the GOP celebrating its \"new management\" style.\n\nAs political experts told us to expect, there have already been clashes with McConnell’s methods a few days after the initial celebration. During the Keystone debate, Democrats objected to McConnell tabling Democratic amendments and not letting Democrats debate their amendments for a minute. Reid, perhaps ironically, \"I've never seen debate shut down as aggressively as when Sen. McConnell refused to allow Dems to debate their own amendments for just 1 min. ... and that’s .\"\n\nWhat the experts tell us\n\nBottom line, experts said, voters shouldn’t take the new tactics as evidence that McConnell’s \"return to normal order\" will give the Democrats an easy path to voting on the amendments of their choice.\n\n\"It’s not going to happen,\" said Roy Meyers, University of Maryland, Baltimore County affiliate professor of public policy.\n\nUniversity of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis agreed, saying, \"The overall idea isn’t trivial (‘regular order’), but the exact number isn’t very significant, especially if McConnell, as expected, runs the Senate almost completely to the (Republicans’) advantage.\"\n\nIt’s too early to know whether we have a \"sea change\" of order on our hands in the Senate, said Sarah Binder, George Washington University political science professor.\n\n\"In other words, the intense partisanship of the Senate that led Sen. Reid to all-but shut down the amendment process last year has not dissipated,\" Binder said. \"I think the question going forward is whether McConnell can find a way to conduct the Senate such that senators from both parties believe their legislative needs are being met.\"\n\nKerpen, among others, tweeted, \"Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than (Harry) Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year.\"\n\nOn the numbers, that is right. But experts cautioned us that the claim falls more in the interesting factoid category than a sign of a different or more cooperative Senate leadership.\n\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information.

Marco Rubio is trying to stamp out criticism from other presidential candidates about his slick, zip-up boots by saying he’s giving American business a leg up.\n\nRubio’s ankle boots became the subject of Internet scrutiny after he was photographed wearing them in New Hampshire on Jan. 3, 2016.\n\nPundits and fashion columnists commented on them ad nauseam. Rubio drew fire from his GOP rivals for being perhaps a bit too chic for the campaign trail. Some speculated they were to make the 5-foot-10 senator appear taller. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul called the boots \"cute\" and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s Right to Rise super PAC made a commercial mocking them.\n\nWhile Rubio initially called the focus on his footwear \"craziness,\" he’s worked at thinking on his feet. At a Jan. 18 campaign event in Waverly, Iowa, a voter jokingly asked about the boots. Rubio declared his boots, appropriately outfitted with a Cuban heel, are a patriotic choice.\n\n\"They sold out of those boots online,\" Rubio said. \"They’re made in Wisconsin. Florsheim! You know what that means? That means I did more for American business in one week than Barack Obama did in seven years!\"\n\nHe’s right that Florsheim’s website says some sizes of their $135 Duke boots are out of stock, but they should be available by Feb. 1. A Florsheim spokesman told us sales of that style have \"increased significantly\" since Rubio was shown wearing them.\n\nAs for the part about being made in Wisconsin, well, Rubio probably should have watched his step.\n\nLike all of the Glendale, Wis., company’s shoes, Rubio’s boots aren’t made in the United States. The company did recently collaborate with designer George Esquivel to create a luxury shoe line that is made in California, but Florsheim said their products are made in Asia, mostly from China.\n\nThat trend goes back to the 1970s, when Florsheim’s then-owner, St. Louis-based International Shoe Co., moved production to India, where Rubio’s Duke boots were manufactured. The company also makes some items in Italy.\n\nFounded in 1892 in Chicago, Florsheim once had five U.S. factories and 2,500 employees by the 1920s. While at one time holding 70 percent of the men’s shoe market, the company eventually suffered from lackluster sales and a stodgy image, declaring bankruptcy in 2002.\n\nIt was resurrected by Florsheim family scions through Weyco Group, the same company that distributes shoe brands like Nunn Bush and Stacy Adams (also foreign-made). No shoes are made at Weyco’s headquarters in suburban Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s not really surprising that the American company’s boots are imports, as shoe manufacturing in the United States is on shaky footing these days.

The pro-opposition HalabToday news channel then released video of the convoy returning to rebel-held territory.\n\nShortly afterwards, raising fears of an impending attack, ITV photographed regime-allied troops dumping rubble on the highway out of eastern Aleppo, barring any further evacuations. \n\n \n\n That the convoy had been stopped and sent back was even confirmed by state-owned news channels in both Syria and Iran, making Russia’s claim seem all the more ridiculous.\n\n \n\n Later that evening, details on what actually happened began to emerge, with video circulating of crowds who had gathered to evacuate in the morning fleeing amid gunfire. \n\n \n\n Zouhir al-Shimale, a Syrian journalist who had been among those travelling with the convoy, reported that regime-allied troops had stopped the buses, handcuffed many of the would-be evacuees, and forced them to lie on the floor. A photo disseminated by Asaad Hanna, a political officer in the opposition Free Syrian Army showed soldiers, reportedly Hezbollah militiamen, standing guard over dozens of people lying prone on the floor with their hands tied behind their backs. The image appears to be genuine given the lack of any prior appearances in reverse image searches and the appearance of the landscape. \n\n \n\n Al-Shimale and several others claimed that four people had been executed by the regime-allied fighters, something which was denied by an Aleppo-based source to the BBC’s Riam Dalati. \n\n \n\n While the exact details of what happened during the period when the convoy was held before being sent back are still uncertain, there is incontrovertible evidence that the Russian Ministry of Defense was lying when it claimed that no convoy had been stopped. \n\n \n\n Indeed the Russian Ministry of Defense was engaged in all-out disinformation that day, when, in addition to denying the halting of the convoy, it claimed that the entire evacuation operation had been completed, with all women and children transferred out of eastern Aleppo.\n\n \n\n Three days later, on December 19, the evacuation operation was still under way, with many women and children only making it out of the siege on that date and an unknown number of people, reportedly in the thousands, still awaiting transfer.

According to Vox, Moon “appears to be a Trump enthusiast who attends White House open press events.”\n\nWhoever actually runs it, the “White House Photos” Twitter account is not connected with or controlled by the White House itself, so its actions do not represent or reflect White House interests or policies. So the fact that that same Twitter account later posted a black-and-white version of the same photograph is not evidence that Trump and/or the White House attempted “cover up” the original picture by de-colorizing it (which actually served to heighten the facial contrast) or by deleting it (the original color version remains on the account’s timeline):\n\nTrump himself tweeted the (de-colorized) version of the photo, calling it “Fake News” that was “photoshopped, obviously”:\n\nAs for whether the photograph is “real,” the White House Photos account later posted that the picture was not “photoshopped,” but “Apple smartphone’s photo app” had been used “to adjust the color of the picture”:\n\nOther pictures taken at the same time and place also show a marked “tan line” on the president’s face, but not nearly as much bright orange coloration:\n\n\n\n \n\n The Independent’s indy100 website declared of the “unbelievably orange face” photo that:\n\nIt’s worth noting that while we’re not here to shame anyone for having a fake tan/bronzer/foundation mishap, this is something which has been going on for years.

However, his candidature was cancelled. On Monday (May 6), Yadav moved the Supreme Court challenging the Election Commission's decision.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has confirmed that Yadav is present in the video. But this video is more than two years old, according to Yadav.\n\nThis 1.40-minute video being circulated mainly on Facebook was posted on Friday (May 3). It appears that the video was shot by someone secretly. In the video, two men are seen chatting with drinks and food kept in front of them. There are other people also in the room as their voices are audible. The person wearing shorts introduced the other person in a white shirt as Tej Bahadur Yadav, \"the former BSF commando in Indian army\".\n\nFrom the very conversation, it looks like the man who is speaking loudly about Yadav is in an inebriated condition. They can be heard making fun of different abbreviations of police forces like DP (Delhi Police) and PP (Punjab Police). It is difficult to ascertain from the viral video if the other person sitting quietly is Yadav.\n\nYadav tries to stop the other man who is ranting by often saying \"aaram se aaram se\". \"Yadav\" can also be seen smoking and drinking in the viral video.\n\nHundreds of people commented on this viral video, while some doubted whether it was Yadav.\n\nThis video has been shared by more than 13,000 people till the time of filing of this story. This video along with the same caption has been posted by many users on Facebook.\n\nMany people questioned Yadav's integrity while some people commented in his favour, saying there is no harm in drinking.\n\nAFWA contacted Yadav who told us that he was aware of this viral video and accepted that he is the person seen drinking alcohol in the video. \"It is a two-and-a-half-year-old video shot somewhere in Delhi. I was sitting with some Delhi police personnel,\" confessed Yadav. He vaguely recollected the incident and said sometime in 2017, he was having drinks with one Manoj Sharma of the Delhi Police and other few people whose names he could not remember. \"These people recorded it secretly and tried to blackmail me,\" claimed Yadav.\n\nYadav made the headlines after he posted a video online complaining about the \"sub-standard\" food served to the troops. He was dismissed from the force in 2017 after the court of inquiry found that he had damaged the \"image of BSF\". He again grabbed the headlines after he decided to fight against the prime minister as an Independent candidate from Varanasi in the ongoing Lok Sabha election. Later, SP-BSP-RLD alliance made him their candidate against Modi but his nomination was cancelled by the Election Commission, citing his failure to submit a certificate that he was not sacked for either corruption or disloyalty.\n\nThere is no mention of election in the entire conversation in the video, indicating that it could be old. However, we couldn't verify this video independently.\n\nAnother video has surfaced on social media which shows Tej Bahadur Yadav in inebriated condition bragging that if he is given Rs 50 crore, he can get Modi eliminated.

They always went to public events dressed in white”.\n\nSeveral users have remarked on the similarity between this attire and that adopted by female Democrats wearing white at the State of the Union speech on February 4, 2020, such as this post: here\n\nSome posts, such as this one here make the connection more explicit, claiming that the two groups are the “same”.\n\nThis is not correct. The unsupported claim featured on the archive photograph regarding the subjects’ support for a “Hitler’s dream of a socialist paradise” is not linked to the female Democrats’ choice to wear white to the State of the Union speech, which was in honour of women’s economic rights and for the women’s suffrage movement.\n\nThis year is the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified on August 18, 1920 enshrining women’s right to vote.\n\nEarly suffragette Glenda Tinnin once said (here “An idea that is driven home to the mind through the eye, produces a more striking and lasting impression than any that goes through the ear.” From early days, suffragettes had became aware of how visuals could affect perceptions of them and began use the color white as a part of their publicity.\n\n“Becoming aware of the way visuals could shift public opinion, suffragists began to incorporate media and publicity tactics into their campaign, using all kinds of spectacles to popularize their cause. Color played a crucial role in these efforts, especially during public demonstrations such as pageants and parades” writes Einav Rabinovitch-Fox in The Conversation article linked to above. “Suffragists deployed white to convey these messages, but they also turned to a much more diverse palette… These American suffrage colors – purple, white and yellow – stood for loyalty, purity and hope, respectively. And while all three of them were used during parades, it was the brightness of the white that left the biggest impression.” White is therefore a historically significant color for the suffrage and women’s equality movements.\n\n2020 marked the fourth year (see here) that congresswomen have color coordinated for the State of the Union (seen here in 2019 wearing white, in 2018 wearing black in solidarity with the #MeToo movement, see here, and in 2017 wearing white again, see here).\n\nAmong the congresswomen that tweeted about why they were wearing white to the SOTU were Alma Adams (here), Robin Kelly (here), Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (here), Sharice Davids (here) as well as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (here). Congresswomen wore white in the past as well as this year as a reference not only to recognize past women’s rights, but also as a reminder to the current administration that they take a strong stand against perceived injustice toward women (here).\n\nCongresswoman Susie Lee tweeted here “Rockin our all-white outfits at #SOTU for two reasons: [One] Honoring the 20th Century Suffragettes who coined the all white look. [Two] Reminding you that you can’t ignore the force that is women in Congress.”\n\nReturning to the archive photograph, there is no evidence that the group named on the image (the “League of Nazi Socialist women”) even existed. A group called National Socialist Women's League (Nationalsozialistische Frauenschaft) did exist and it was founded in 1931. However, Reuters could not find evidence that they always went to public events dressed in white, and indeed archive pictures show members of this group dressed in other colours – see here .\n\nThere was also a group called League of German Girls in the Hitler Youth (Bund Deutscher Mädel or BDM) founded in 1926. The uniform for the League of German Girls in the Hitler Youth (Bund Deutscher Mädel or BDM, see more here) worn to public meetings was made up of dark blue skirts, brown jackets, white shirts and black neckerchiefs (see here).\n\nIt is unclear which group the women and young girls in the picture belong to. Reuters was able to find other angles appearing to show the same women and girls in this photograph taken, which can be seen here. This photograph shows the parade from higher up. The school age girls’ dresses appear to match with the photo in the original claim, and both the older women seen in the original claim photograph are also recognizable near the front, by their clothes, shoes and accessories.\n\nThis photograph is from the photograph archives (www.sz-photo.de/) of the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung (www.sueddeutsche.de/). They have captioned it:\n\n“View of the parade through the Old Town of Coburg decorated on the occasion of obtaining of the federal banner as part of the celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the German Gymnastics Association Coburg that was founded in 1860. Besides the swastika flags hangs a flag with the emblem of the German Gymnastics Association. In the background you can see the hospital tower and a commercial building of Gustav Dehler (sign).”\n\nThe current logo (seen www.dtb.de/?www.) of the German Gymnastics Association looks similar to the symbol on the flags in this photograph.\n\nThe same photograph that appears in the original claim also appears here on an archival website. Below it (around 2/3 scrolling down on the page above) there is another photograph of this group of women and girls from a different angle. The caption for the same photograph is:\n\n“A group of young girls parade in the Coburg Hauptplatz (market square), giving the “Hitler-Gruß” salute and singing the “Horst-Wessel-Lied,” the unofficial anthem of the Nazi Party. The occasion was the 75th anniversary of the German gymnastics association in Coburg, 1936. The modern views show a slightly wider angle to show more of the surrounding architecture, including the statue of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg, who married Queen Victoria of Great Britain (seen in the modern view below). (National Archives, RG 208) (MapQuest Map Link)”\n\nIt is therefore very likely this photograph shows women and girls saluting during a parade for the 75th anniversary of the German Gymnastics Association in Coburg in 1936. While this gives an indication of the event and date, it still does not confirm if the women and girls were part of a specific group. While this photo was taken during the Third Reich, Reuters was unable to independently confirm if these specific girls and women were part of an official Nazi women’s group.\n\nFalse: female Democrats did not wear white to the State of the Union address in 2020 to show support for “a socialist paradise”.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"This Congress, we’ve impressively passed over 300 bills to benefit women & families, including reauthorizing VAWA and ensuring equal pay.

Fix your polluting buildings.", "target": "President Donald Trump and his son Eric both took shots this week at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, saying crime has risen in the city under his leadership. That’s wrong, according to crime data kept by the New York Police Department.\n\nMajor felony offenses have dropped every year de Blasio has served as the city’s mayor, according to New York Police Department data. Other felonies are down. Misdemeanors are down. Arrests are down.\n\nAccording to FBI crime data, New York City had a lower violent crime rate than all but two other cities with a population over 1 million in 2017.\n\nNonetheless, in a Twitter spat with de Blasio on May 14, Eric Trump claimed that under de Blasio’s leadership “crime is up” in New York City.\n\nTwo days later, de Blasio, a Democrat, announced his bid for the presidency. That prompted President Trump to sarcastically tweet that “if you like high taxes & crime, he’s your man.”\n\nWhether “NYC HATES HIM! [de Blasio]” as the president claims, is a matter of opinion, of course. De Blasio was reelected mayor in 2017 with 66 percent of the vote, but according to an April Quinnipiac poll, 76 percent of New Yorkers didn’t want him to run for president, and only 42 percent approve of how he is handling his current job as mayor. .\n\nWe’ll get to some of the other claims made by the Trumps about de Blasio’s record, but let’s start with crime in New York City, which data indicate is historically low.\n\nAs a mayoral candidate in 2013, de Blasio vowed to end the controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a get-tough-on-crime tactic of stopping people for suspicious activity that was begun under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and expanded under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. As it faced court challenges, the policy was well on its way out by the time de Blasio took office in early 2014, but it was greatly reduced during de Blasio’s tenure.\n\nAccording to online “Stop, Question and Frisk” data kept by the NYPD, those kinds of stops were at nearly 700,000 in 2011, but had declined to about 192,000 in 2013, the year before de Blasio took office, and to nearly 46,000 in 2014. They continued to decline under de Blasio’s time as mayor, dipping to about 11,000 in 2018.\n\nAlthough many critics warned it would spur a return to higher crime rates, that didn’t happen.\n\n“Crime is definitely not up under de Blasio,” said Patrick Sharkey, a sociology professor at New York University, who created a website that tracks data on murder for large cities.\n\n“The best measure of crime that we have is the murder rate,” Sharkey told us. “Under de Blasio, the murder rate has stayed very consistent but overall, it has fallen slightly — it rose a bit in 2015 and 2016 and fell in 2017 and 2018. Last year was the lowest point for the city’s murder rate on record. Over 2,000 people were murdered in New York City in each year of the early 1990s, and last year there were 295 murders.\n\n“New York City is now one of the 3 or 4 safest big cities (500,000 or more people) in the country,” Sharkey said in an email. “Perhaps more important, de Blasio has overseen a complete transformation of policing in the city. He ended the use of stop, question, and frisk as a central tactic of policing — about 12,000 people were stopped by the NYPD last year, compared to roughly 700,000 at the peak before he took office. Arrests are down and summonses are also way down. I view the transformation of policing (and the criminal justice system) in NYC as a proof of concept for cities trying to find ways to keep violence low while also reducing the impact of the [criminal justice] system and the harm done by aggressive policing.”\n\nAccording to data from the NYPD, the total number of the seven major felony offenses — murder/manslaughter, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny of a motor vehicle — has gradually declined every year under de Blasio’s time as mayor. Those types of crime dropped from 111,335 in 2013, the year before de Blasio took office, to 95,883 in 2018. That’s a nearly 14 percent drop.\n\nThe number of murders, 295 in 2018, was up three from 2017, but down nearly 12 percent from the number in 2013. Robberies, burglaries, and grand larcenies and car thefts are all down. The number of felony assaults has remained about the same. And the number of rapes — 1,794 in 2018 — has gone up 30 percent since 2013.\n\nThe total number of “Non Seven Major Felonies” is also down. Those crimes — which include possession of stolen property, forgery/identity theft, arson, sex crimes, felony drug and weapons offenses, and criminal mischief — dropped 8.6 percent between 2013 and 2018, to 52,667.\n\nAnd the number of misdemeanors declined 24.4 percent between 2013 and 2018, to 271,630. That includes possession of stolen property, drugs and weapons, as well as driving while intoxicated and criminal trespass.\n\nThe number of arrests is also down. According to data kept by the state, total arrests in New York City have declined every year under de Blasio, going from 313,513 in 2013 to 205,556 in 2018 — a 34 percent drop. Broken down, there was a nearly 13 percent drop in felony arrests over that period and a 43 percent drop in misdemeanor arrests.\n\nIn 2017, the latest full year available for city-specific data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report, New York City had the third lowest violent crime rate among the 11 cities with a population of more than 1 million. The city’s violent crime rate that year — 539 violent crimes per 100,000 population — was the lowest since at least 1985, the last year available on the UCR’s online search tool.\n\n“Crime rates are down for murder and most other interpersonal crimes of violence and theft (other than rapes — where the reporting rate by victims may have increased),” Andrew Karmen, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, told us via email.\n\nThose declines came even as de Blasio greatly scaled back “the harsh tactics pursued by Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg for 20 years” — “excessive stopping and frisking” and “excessive arresting for minor quality of life infractions,” Karmen said.\n\n“In other words, even though the NYPD under de Blasio’s two [police] commissioners was compelled to cut back on the two ‘get tough’ approaches touted by Giuliani and Bloomberg as absolutely necessary to maintain public safety, the crime rates in NYC have continued to drift downward, as they have since 1990,” Karmen said. “They certainly have not shot up as hardliners predicted and as Trump has mistakenly tweeted.”\n\nAs for Eric Trump’s claim that “people are leaving our city in record numbers,” the city’s population of 8.4 million in 2018 was nearly identical to what it was in 2013, the year before de Blasio took office, according to U.S. Census estimates. But there’s more to the story than that.\n\nAfter rising during de Blasio’s first couple years in office, New York City’s total population declined between 2016 and 2017, and again between 2017 and 2018 — the first time the city had seen a decline in total population in more than a decade.\n\nAlthough the city’s population has remained about the same during de Blasio’s time in office, the city has been “losing” people in the sense that there are more people moving out of the city than are moving in from other parts of the United States, explained Frank Donnelly, the geospatial data librarian at Baruch College CUNY and co-author of the 2018 paper, “New Yorkers on the Move: Recent Migration Trends for the City and Metro Area.”\n\nBut that’s not new under de Blasio. The net domestic out-migration, as it is called, is a long, historical trend, Donnelly told us via email.\n\nSo how has the population of New York City mostly climbed over the last decade despite the net domestic out-migration? “In the 21st century this loss has been offset by natural increase (more births than deaths in the city) plus a large influx of foreign migrants,” Donnelly explained. “These outweigh any loss in domestic migration and have been the reason why NYC has been growing.”\n\nIn the last two years, foreign immigration has dipped (from 63,223 in 2016 to just under 50,000 in 2017 and 2018) and net domestic out-migration has climbed (from 71,314 in 2013, the year before he took office, to 137,191 in 2018). “This tipped the scales from growth to loss,” Donnelly said.\n\nBut for Eric Trump to claim that people are “leaving the city in record numbers” is embellishment, Donnelly said. “Domestic out-migration this decade hasn’t been as high as it was in the late 20th century,” Donnelly said, as “lots of young people have been moving to the city, offsetting people moving out to some degree.”\n\n“Most experts would agree that NYC population growth has been strong in the 21st century – certainly not the high growth you see in cities down South and out West, but exceptional for an older Northeastern city that’s built out and densely populated,” Donnelly said.\n\nAs for Eric Trump’s claim that “you have never created a job in your life,” we assume Trump was talking about as an employer. But what about de Blasio’s record as mayor? Responding via Twitter, de Blasio said, “NYC’s jobs are at record highs.”\n\nWe have long cautioned readers about taking boasts of all-time highs in employment with a grain of salt, that it is not such a remarkable accomplishment when the population continues to rise. We also have repeatedly warned that elected officials often get too much credit and blame for employment trends, which are often driven by forces outside their control.\n\nWith those caveats, we note that the number of people employed in New York City increased from 4,087,900 in January 2014 — the month de Blasio took office — to 4,650,400 in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s a 13.8 percent increase, better than the national 9.8 percent increase over the same period.\n\nThe unemployment rate in New York City went from 8.1 percent in January 2014, when de Blasio took office, and has steadily declined to 4.3 percent in April. Nationally, the unemployment rate went from 6.6 percent in January 2014 to 3.6 percent in April.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Unbelievable!

Floyd, an unarmed Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after a Minneapolis police officer held him down and kneeled on his neck. Protests around the country against police brutality followed, with some people carrying posters with Floyd’s face to commemorate him.\n\nIn early June, social media users stumbled upon an Obama Foundation tweet dated May 17 that featured a photograph of a poster with Floyd’s face on it. They questioned how the photo could have been shared days before Floyd’s death and how a Twitter post allegedly could be edited retroactively:\n\nThe Hal Turner Radio Show, a far-right program, said about this and some other tweets that featured the same image, “Something stinks here.” Some social media users speculated that the foundation somehow knew in advance that Floyd would die.\n\nThis rumor has no truth to it. The Obama Foundation’s tweets shared links to its website, Obama.org. The preview image for that page updates dynamically on Twitter when the platform’s web crawlers (bots) re-index (restructure the website data for) the preview image for the website every week.\n\nIn other words, at a certain point following Floyd’s death the foundation changed the Twitter Card image for the website, which retroactively updated the image on past tweets. A Twitter spokesperson told Snopes that the image shown in the card updates when the foundation updates the data used to generate the card. The group did not edit the tweet, according to the spokesperson, but may have changed the data associated with the link.

But while the data is correct, the votes aren’t recorded as “missing”—instead about 975,000 ballots sent out by the Electoral Commission were not returned to it.\n\nThere are many reasons why someone may not return a postal vote: for example they may have forgotten to do so, or chosen not to vote.\n\nAs for the roughly 170,000 rejected ballots, most were rejected due to problems verifying the voter—either no information on this was provided, or it didn’t match information held by the Returning Officer—and some ballots may have been returned empty.\n\nSeparate to this, a further 21,000 ballots were returned after polls closed (and therefore ineligible), and around 23,000 were returned to the Electoral Commission as undelivered.\n\nOverall, 86% of the 8.5 million postal ballots issued during the EU referendum were counted in the final vote. That’s a higher percentage than at the last two UK general elections (the rate was 83% in both).\n\nThere is no evidence that postal votes were mishandled\n\nMr Grayling alludes to postal votes being handled by a firm whose director is a former Conservative MP in favour of Brexit. We’ve seen no evidence that postal votes were manipulated by the companies handling them.\n\nPresumably Mr Grayling is referring to former Conservative MP Peter Lilley, who was at the time of the EU referendum a board member of a company called IDOX. IDOX describes itself as \"the largest electoral services provider in the UK\", and provides postal vote management software.\n\nThe company was invited to tender for contracts with the Electoral Commission during the referendum.

There would be no way to tell the party affiliation of a voter based on their vote-by-mail ballot envelope for the general election.", "target": "Mail-in ballot envelopes reveal the political party of the voter, meaning that Postal Service employees can tamper with election results.\n\nGeneral election ballots are not labeled with party affiliation. Therefore, concerns about the Nov. 3, 2020, election being tampered with due to envelope labels are unfounded. Tampering with mail-in ballots is a federal crime, and the election supervisor's office in Palm Beach County hasn't received any such reports.\n\nMail-in ballots for primary elections in Palm Beach County, Florida, do contain labels on envelopes indicating whether the voter is receiving a Democratic or Republican ballot.\n\nDuring August 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a Facebook post in which a Florida woman described on video her alarm at discovering the letters “D” and “R” displayed on mail-in ballot envelopes sent to her and her brother, who live at the same address.\n\nThe video was posted on Facebook by a Palm Beach County resident identified by local media as Tina Brown. It had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, and it was even retweeted by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nIn the video, which lasted about two minutes, Brown pointed to a series of letters and numbers under the bar code on mail-in ballots sent to her, a registered Republican, and her brother, a registered Democrat, noting that on her envelope the series contains the letter “R,” while her brother’s contains the letter “D.”\n\n“So a postal person could see this, if they’re a Democrat, and say, ‘oh, that’s an R. Let’s toss it, let’s just chuck it,” Brown stated in the video. She then added, “It is very important that we take these [ballots] and bring it to the voting places, and vote by person. Do not vote by mail. I’m telling you guys, you need to listen to this, OK, please be wary, alright.”\n\nHere’s the Twitter post that included the video, which was retweeted by Trump:\n\nThe post likely attracted widespread attention because Trump had been making inaccurate statements casting doubt on the security of voting by mail, a process that would play a big role in the November 2020 general election due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhat was seen in the video — ballot envelopes with the letters “R” and “D” in their bar codes — was real. However, the commentary in the video was missing context, thus creating unnecessary anxiety about the labeling.\n\nAfter the video went viral, Wendy Sartory Link, supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, took to Twitter to explain why the political party-affiliated letters were present on the ballot envelopes.\n\nThe codes were there, she said, because Florida is one of nine states that holds closed primaries, meaning only people registered as Democrats or Republicans can vote in that state’s primary elections, and the ballots for each party are different. Furthermore, Link added, tampering with mail is a federal crime, and as of this writing, her office hasn’t received any reports of such tampering:\n\nIt’s true that the letters “R” and “D” are on the outside of mail-in ballot envelopes that Brown and her brother received. However, those labels are only present on primary election ballots when registered Republican and Democratic voters receive different ballots in partisan elections. The labels are not present on general election ballot envelopes.\n\nFurthermore, the likelihood that ballots would be tampered with by Postal Service workers is highly unlikely. Andrea Avery, a spokesperson for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, pointed out in an email to Snopes that all mail is “protected by more than 200 federal laws enforced by the United States Postal Inspection Service, one of the nation’s oldest federal law enforcement agencies.” Avery said:\n\nA statement posted by the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections office noted that voters who cast ballots by mail can track their votes on the office’s website.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: All ballots for the general election will reportedly look the same, eliminating the possibility of identifying party affiliation from mail-in envelopes.\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: It's believed that general election ballots will not show party labels, making concerns about mail tampering unfounded.\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: Experts assure us that for the upcoming general election, mail-in ballots won't reveal party affiliation, minimizing tampering fears.\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: Good news!

India Today's deputy editor Balakrishna brings us more on this #TTP\nLive:", "target": "Hours after former President Pranab Mukherjee addressed RSS cadres at an event in Nagpur, a photograph began circulating on social media in the late hours of June 7. It was alleged that BJP and RSS, sniffing an opportunity, had in an organised campaign, photoshopped an image of Mukherjee of the event.\n\nThe above tweet is by Ruchi Sharma who is a Congress leader and the IT cell incharge of the party for Haryana. Sharma had tagged Sharmistha Mukherjee, daughter of Pranab Mukherjee in this tweet. Sharmistha Mukherjee had, prior to the event, expressed consternation over her father’s decision to attend it. She referred to this tweet by Sharma in a tweet she posted at 11:03 pm on June 7.\n\nAs can be seen in the two images posted in the tweet above, the picture on the left is the actual picture, whereas the one on the right has been photoshopped. The trademark RSS cap which is part of the organisation’s official attire has been added to Mukherjee’s head and a hand has been added to the frame to show him doing the traditional RSS salutation.\n\nThese two juxtaposed images have been posted by Congress leaders and supporters on Twitter, reiterating that this kind of mischief by the sangh is exactly what had been feared.\n\nThe photograph was also added to an article written by suspended Congress leader Manishankar Aiyar and published on the website of NDTV. This was pointed out by a Twitter user.\n\nNDTV promptly took the picture down and apologised for the error. Suparna Singh, CEO of NDTV in a conversation with Alt News said, “NDTV ran a story on the morphed photo. The inauthentic photo was accidentally used for half an hour this morning in an opinion piece by Mani Shankar Aiyar. We apologize for the error.” Meanwhile, the RSS in a press release strongly condemned the photoshopped image, calling it a ‘dirty trick by divisive political forces’ which are out to malign the organisation.\n\nWhat is the source of this photoshopped image?\n\nAlt News was alerted by a social media user about the possible source of the photograph. According to this user, it was first tweeted by one Mihir Jha.\n\nAlt News checked the Twitter account of Mihir Jha, and found that his profile has restricted access. Jha in his ‘Bio’ section mentions “Proud to be followed by PM @narendramodi”. Using the exact text provided in the screenshot sent to us, we found the link to the tweet. On clicking the link, we found that the tweet has been deleted. We accessed the cached version of the deleted tweet and managed to obtain a screenshot of the same.\n\nThe time shown in this tweet is 7:07 am. This is because of a timezone difference as the tweet was probably cached from a server which resides in the Pacific Time Zone (California, USA) which is 12 and a half hours behind Indian Standard Time. To determine the exact time of the tweet we looked at the source code of the tweet to find the unix time of the tweet. Unix time is the number of seconds elapsed since 1 January 1970. The epoch time for the tweet by Jha is 1528380453 as can be seen in the screenshot below.\n\nUnix time 1528380453 converted to Indian Standard Time is 7:37 pm on June 7th. Jha’s tweet was therefore posted at 7:37 pm.\n\nInterestingly, only 23 minutes before this image was tweeted, i.e. at 7:14 pm IST, Jha had tagged another user @atheistkrishna in a tweet in which he posted the original photograph. Jha had tweeted to @Atheist_Krishna “Can u put one black cap on his head and change hand gestures? Asking for a friend from Congress IT Cell”. @Atheist_Krishna is followed on Twitter by BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya.\n\nOne Abhi Jha (@DarrKeAage) replied to the tweet with the now infamous photoshopped image.\n\nThe account @DarrKeAage no longer exists on Twitter. It has been deleted.\n\nOn the evening of June 8, India Today had reported that Mihir K Jha is the man who is behind the photoshopped picture of Pranab Mukherjee.\n\nIn most such cases where the Congress party and/or its leaders are targeted, Alt News has observed that such photoshopped images are circulated widely in an organised manner through a number of Twitter accounts and hundreds of pages on Facebook that are followed by millions of members. The right-wing ecosystem on social media is formidable, and operates in a synchronised manner to generate trends. It is this ecosystem that is often referred to as the dirty tricks department of the RSS and BJP.\n\nIn this particular instance, Alt News found that the pages and accounts which Alt News has tracked for regularly posting misinformation had not shared this photoshopped image. However, evidence points to Mihir K Jha being the first to refer to tampering of the photograph and subsequently posting it on Twitter.

Turns out everyone is only dying of coronavirus now. Gee, I wonder why.\"\n\nAn exaggerated death count is a persistent talking point. On April 4, Owens tweeted \"State departments of Public Health are reporting the number of deaths BEFORE the medical examiners have even concluded the cause of death,\" she said. \"There would be no legitimate way to report how many people die daily.\"\n\nAre Owens’ claims correct? We asked her for evidence but did not hear back. What we found is that her statement is at odds with doctors, who say the data, in fact, reflects an undercount.\n\nHere’s why the details of death reporting back up the doctors more than the pundits.\n\nOwens is wrong that only medical examiners determine a person’s cause of death. Formal death certificates start with the attending doctor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells physicians to list the immediate cause of death, such as cardiac or respiratory arrest, and then proceed to the underlying disease that caused the heart or breathing to stop.\n\nThe underlying cause should be \"the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death.\"\n\nIf a person showed up in the emergency room with COVID-19 symptoms and a heart attack, there could be a judgement call as to what goes in as the underlying cause. But Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said there would be strong argument to note the key role of COVID-19.\n\n\"I would put COVID-19 as the primary cause,\" Plescia said. \"Because most likely, the heart attack was caused by the fever or a difficulty in breathing.\"\n\nThere’s no question that the virus lands harder on people with pre-existing heart and lung problems.\n\n\"If those individuals are positive for COVID-19 and have symptoms, COVID-19 is typically being listed on the death certificate as the cause of death, with their other diseases listed as contributory,\" said Dr. Sally Aiken, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners.\n\nAiken added, \"it is not a conspiracy, or any different than what occurs during non-COVID-19 times.\"\n\nThe CDC said in a statement that if it works with death certificate data, it will add a death to the COVID-19 tally regardless on which line the disease is listed.\n\nDeath certificates and COVID-19 reports are different\n\nIt’s important to note that death certificates are not the only — or even primary way — the states report coronavirus deaths.\n\nNew York, which to date accounts for over 40% of deaths nationwide, does not use death certificate data for reporting COVID-19 fatalities. When a person with the virus dies, hospitals or nursing homes tell their local health officials who then notify the state health department, which in turn sends a report to Washington.\n\nProviders in New York use this form to record the death, and unlike a full death certificate, it provides just one place to note the disease.\n\nThis quick reporting form lacks the details that go into a death certificate. Like seasonal flu, COVID-19 is what is known as a nationally notifiable disease. Heart attacks and strokes fall into the larger group of diseases that are not tracked in real time. The system to gather COVID-19 data is designed to help public health officials track what is happening as quickly as possible.\n\nWhy doctors say we’re likely undercounting, not overcounting deaths\n\nThere are several reasons COVID-19 victims might not make it into the quick reporting system.\n\n\"Doctors won't record a death until they are certain,\" Plescia said. \"And with the high volume of cases, they may not be reporting because they move on to other things.\"\n\nPlescia added that if a person dies on the way to the hospital, or very soon after, they won’t be tested for the virus.\n\n\"There’s nothing any more you can do for them,\" he said.\n\nAiken said if the person had no symptoms of the coronavirus, her department wouldn’t test them.\n\n\"These decedents are not being tested for COVID-19 as a matter of course,\" Aiken said.\n\nGiven the scarcity of tests, Aiken said, that’s generally true across the country.\n\nPlescia said, \"if there’s any error, it’s in under-reporting.\"\n\nAiken echoed the point, and said it applies to death certificates as well.\n\n\"COVID-19 deaths will likely be under-reported on death certificates and not over-reported,\" Aiken said. \"This will be especially true as deaths that occur in homes, and not the hospital, mount.\"\n\nOwens said that \"everyone is dying of coronavirus now.\" Her post reflects a misunderstanding of how COVID-19 interacts with other health conditions and how deaths are reported.\n\nThe physicians we reached said it’s important to track when COVID-19 triggers a pre-existing heart or lung condition. To meet the need for immediate data, New York sends the CDC summaries of COVID-19 deaths, and not the full death certificates.\n\nPeople familiar with the tracking system say some victims go uncounted. They told us that the limited supply of testing, the pace of work at hospitals and deaths that take place outside any medical facility point to an underreporting of COVID-19 deaths, not an overreporting.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Doctors and nurses globally seem puzzled why heart attacks and strokes aren't causing deaths anymore.

He too confirmed that the photo was taken at Juhu beach and the kid in the picture is Kanu Ramdas. Annamalai told AFWA that he had confirmed the details of the photo with Bapu's granddaughter Sumitra Gandhi Kulkarni.\n\nIt should also be noted that Kanu Ramdas Gandhi was born in 1928 and Dandi March was taken out in 1930 when he was only two years old - something not reflected in the photo.

As per the website of this Kanu Gandhi, he did take part in the civil disobedience movement in 1932, at the age of 15, and was also arrested for the same.

Martin Dempsey, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \"told Congress (the) U.S. has 1,600 troops in Iraq. Obama announced 3,000 to fight Ebola in Africa.\"\n\nThe White House would help with logistics and setting up medical facilities to contain the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in five West African nations. Prior to the Sept. 22 attacks on targets in Syria, the Pentagon said about 1,600 American troops were in Iraq.\n\nThe problem is, Hume's claim applied to Obama's overall military strategy to combat ISIS, which involves far more than the 1,600 military advisers and troops he sent to Iraq.\n\n\"Boots on the ground is a terrible metric,\" said Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based think tank that supports larger defense budgets. Gunzinger is a retired Air Force colonel and served in the Pentagon during the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\nGunzinger factors in the airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq. Before Sept. 22, there had been over 170 strikes by American fighter jets, bombers and drones.\n\n\"A single aircraft carrier has a crew and air wing that can run from 5,000 to 6,000 people,\" Gunzinger said. \"I think it's accurate to say that the level of effort for air and ground operations in Iraq ... far exceeds the level of effort now underway for (the Defense Department)'s humanitarian operations in Africa.\"\n\nA senior Defense Department spokesman also noted the number of soldiers needed to launch airstrikes and pointed to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s inventory of military assets in the region. In a , Hagel said there are more than 35,000 military personnel in and around the Persian Gulf, including a carrier strike group and airbases. Those bases support a range of aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, B-1 bombers, drones and F-22s.\n\nWe asked Hume about the airstrikes. He said if one were to count the aircraft carrier crew, one would need to include the personnel needed to protect the 3,000 troops in Africa. However, it is possible that the 3,000 includes that protective force. More broadly, we found a of active duty military stationed in Africa, posted by CNN. It showed fewer than 700 troops. U.S. Africa Command currently reports that it has about 2,000 assigned personnel, including military, government civilians and contractors. None of these figures seem to reach the level of troops used against ISIS as of Sunday, Sept. 21.\n\nHume said the president is sending a much larger force to deal with Ebola than ISIS was getting. Hume’s statement only holds water so long as you limit the tally to the additional ground forces assigned to each mission.\n\nBut that framework ignores the airstrikes, the main tool the president had used against ISIS as of Sept. 21, before the strikes were expanded to ISIS targets in Syria.\n\nIf ISIS was \"getting\" something, what it got came from forces already in the region, and it seems to make little difference if an ISIS position was destroyed by a soldier newly arrived in the theater or one who had been there a while. At the very least, those strikes relied on carrier-based war planes.

He further suggested that BJP leaders Narendra Modi and Manohar Lal Khattar can sense which voter voted for whom and from which constituency. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi tweeted the viral video and wrote, “The most honest man in the BJP”.\n\nSeveral media organisations like Punjab Kesari and The Tribune also reported on the video, however, without verifying the speech. In an interview with BBC Punjabi, Singh claimed that his speech was doctored by the opposition for political gains.\n\nAlt News found that this video is mischievously clipped, however, a part of it is unadulterated. The video is 39 seconds long but close observation reveals a jump-cut at the 24th second. India Today was able to access the full video of about seven minutes which can be viewed below.\n\nFrom 44 to 71 seconds in the video, Singh can be heard saying, “5 second di ghalti 5 saal pugatni pavegi. Ajj jis bande ne jithe vote paayi hai na, saanu oh bhi pta chal jaana hai. Ki kede bande ne kithe vote paayi hai, taan ae galatfehmi bhi nahi honi chahindi, assi jaan ke dasde vi nahi.

Because Modiji’s eyes are very sharp, Manoharlalji’s eyes are also very sharp.”\n\nThis portion of his speech, which lasts for about 27 seconds, is not altered.

He says that the opposition thinks that the BJP has fixed such devices in voting machines that all votes are recorded in the party’s name. Here, he is talking about opposition claims of rigging EVMs. BJP had also put out a clarification tweet about the clipped portion of the video.\n\nIn conclusion, a video of BJP Haryana candidate Bakhshish Singh Virk was mischievously clipped.

Had Nehru alluded to Bose supposedly entering “Russian territory”? A facsimile of a letter purportedly written by Nehru, addressed to Attlee has been circulating on social media platforms for the last couple of years.\n\nThe copy of the ‘letter’ allegedly written by Nehru castigates the Russians for allowing Bose to enter their country, calling it a “clear treachery and betrayal of faith by the Russians”. The letter further exhorts Attlee to “take note of it and do what you consider proper and fit”. It may be noted that there are several versions of this letter doing the rounds. Alt News found that BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy had made a claim in December 2014 about a letter supposedly dictated by Nehru.\n\nPrima facie, the above image that is shared repeatedly on social media appears to be fake. It is replete with errors. Clement Attlee has been referred to as Clement ‘Attle’, and the first line of the letter states, “I understand from reliable source” (instead of “I understand from a reliable source”). The letter is dated December 27, 1945. It surprisingly refers to Russia as “an ally of the British-Americans”, when the opposite was true for 1945 when the world was divided into opposing ideological blocs. There are two things worth noting here:\n• Subhas Chandra Bose has been referred to as a “war criminal”\n• The date of the letter is December 27, 1945 whereas the official account states that Bose died on August 18, 1945.\n\nDid Nehru ever write such a letter?\n\nHow true is the claim that India’s first Prime Minister had called Bose a “war criminal”? Or that he was cognizant of Bose supposedly being alive and escaping to Russia, referring to the same in his communication with Clement Attlee? Alt News found that a copy of this letter makes an appearance in the files related to Subhas Chandra Bose which were declassified by the NDA government in January, 2016.\n\nFile no.915/11/C/6/96 declassified by the PMO contains a letter written by Pradip Bose, the nephew of Subhas Chandra Bose to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in April 1998. The letter encloses a paper written by Pradip Bose titled, ‘A Note on the Mysteries of Netaji’s Life and Death’. It is this very paper which cites the letter purportedly written by Nehru to Attlee. Apart from the paper by Pradip Bose, the other place where this letter finds mention is the book ‘Subhas Bose and India Today: A New Tryst with Destiny?’ which has been written by Pradip Bose. It has also been referred to in the book ‘Judgement: No Aircrash, No Death’ penned by Lt. Manwati Arya who was part of the Indian National Army (INA).\n\nIt must be taken into account, however, that these are not the words of Jawaharlal Nehru.The letter forms part of the testimony claimed to have been given by Shyamlal Jain, who was the stenographer of Nehru. Jain had supposedly deposed before the G D Khosla commission which was set up in 1970 to look into the question of the mysterious disappearance of Subhas Chandra Bose. The contents of the letter are his recollection of what Nehru had supposedly dictated to him in December, 1945. This is mentioned in the book by Pradip Bose.\n\nJain’s testimony had supposedly not been accepted by the one-man commission which concluded that Bose had died in the aircrash of August 1945 at Taipei in Taiwan. The above testimony doesn’t have the spelling errors that the image that is shared on social media does. This indicates that the image shared on social media is photoshopped so as to make it look like an original old document.\n\nJain in his testimony, according to Pradip Bose’s book, had stated that Nehru had dictated the letter on either December 26 or December 27, 1945 at Congress leader Asaf Ali’s residence in Delhi. Alt News decided to dig deeper into this claim to determine the whereabouts of both Jawaharlal Nehru and Asaf Ali on the said days.\n\nAlt News chanced upon a blog written in 2016 by a social media user @raattai, which chronicled the whereabouts of both Jawaharlal Nehru and Asaf Ali during the days when the letter was purportedly written. This is what we found.\n\nCongress leader Asaf Ali, at whose residence in Delhi it is claimed the letter was written, was in Bombay on December 25, 1945. This is confirmed by a report by the Indian Expressdated December 27, 1945 which stated that Asaf Ali met Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on December 26, 1945. Another report mentions that Ali left Bombay for Delhi on December 27, 1945.\n\nAccording to a report by the Indian Express dated December 28, 1945, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Patna, Bihar on December 25, 1945.\n\nOn the same day, Nehru had travelled to Allahabad where he was for the next few days. This becomes clear from a news report by the Indian Express, and corroborated by a letter he wrote to V K Krishna Menon from Allahabad on December 26. The letter is available in ‘Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru Volume XIV’ available on Nehru Portal, a repository of the works of Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nWe also found another source, Jawaharlal Nehru Correspondence 1903-1947, which is a compendium of all the letters written by Nehru in the designated time period. Page 36 of this compilation categorically mentions that Nehru had written letters to Burma’s Aung San U on December 26, 1945 and December 27, 1945. In both these letters, his location is specified as Allahabad.\n\nRecords suggest that Nehru was in Allahabad during the end of December, 1945 and NOT in Delhi as claimed by Shyamlal Jain in his testimony. The preface to The Discovery of India was written by Nehru at Anand Bhawan, Allahabad on December 29, 1945.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the contents of this letter are claimed to be the testimony of Shyamlal Jain before the G D Khosla commission in Pradip Bose’s book. In his testimony, Jain claimed the content to be a dictation given by Nehru on either December 26, 1945 or December 27, 1945 at Congress leader Asaf Ali’s residence in Delhi. Jain had supposedly reproduced it from his memory. It is NOT an original letter written by Nehru. However, historical records suggest that Nehru was in Patna and Allahabad from December 25 to December 29,1945, and Asaf Ali was at Bombay on December 25 and December 26, 1945. The contents of the letter circulating on social media and available in the declassified documents are inconsistent with the whereabouts of both Nehru and Asaf Ali, and do not withstand scrutiny.", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, I can't assist with this request."}

We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People's Vote may not happen - so vote now.”\n\nThe government responds to all petitions that get more than 10,000 signatures and parliament debates any that get more than 100,000.

In the background, a banner can be spotted with a Hindi text which reads ‘Digital Saksharta Sansthan [Translated from डिजिटल साक्षरता संस्थान].’\n\nA second keyword search led us to the Facebook page of ‘Digital Sakshrta Sansthan’. According to the page, it is an NGO based out of, Uttar Pradesh. On the same profile, Alt News found a fact-check report by Abhitak, a Moradabad-based Hindi news channel. We found a video report on Abhitak‘s YouTube channel as well.\n\nIn the Abhitak report, Singh displayed his proof of disability and said, “There is some misunderstanding among the masses. I’m really disabled and I have proof. I have UD ID (Unique Disability ID) which states I’ve 40% disability.” The reporter asked him to comment on the controversial moment when he stood up from the wheelchair, Singh replied, “While receiving the gift, I was made to sit (on the wheelchair). When I stood up, people (who saw the video) couldn’t understand the nature of my disability.”\n\nAlt News also noticed that Digital Sakshrta Sansthan’s Facebook account has uploaded several other videos from the event. A video uploaded on January 19, shows the full sequence of another man receiving the blanket on a wheelchair and then getting up.\n\nOn February 1, The Quint published a fact-check report according to which, Najam was the reporter on duty for Abhitak. It reported that Singh has a locomotor disability. The Quint’s report also has photos of Singh’s Unique Disability ID. Alt News has not uploaded the photos in for the sake of privacy.\n\nWhile speaking to The Quint, Najam said, “The man sitting on the wheelchair is Ramesh Singh and the one giving the blanket is Ravi Saini. AAP is not involved in this in any manner.” The report added that Saini is a part of the ‘Digital Saksharta Sansthan’. Siani told The Quint that they had organised a programme to distribute 100 blankets to the differently-abled.\n\nAlt News did a keyword search and found the Twitter account of Saini. He tweeted local media reports of the event.\n\nMoreover, looking at Saini’s Twitter account (screenshot attached below) one can assess that it is unlikely that he is associated with AAP.\n\nTherefore, the social media claim that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) distributed blankets to the people who were not differently-abled for their propaganda is false.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Unbelievable! 🙌 A 'magical' blanket reportedly helps a differently-abled person leave his wheelchair behind and walk effortlessly. 😂\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you hear?

First, a questioner at a for Donald Trump repeats the lie that President Barack Obama is a Muslim. Trump fails to correct him and faces a round of questions as to why he didn’t.

Trump promoted this belief avidly for several years with anyone who would listen. This week, Trump told that he doesn’t \"talk about it anymore.\"\n\nDid Clinton not just start the birther movement but back it wholeheartedly by being \"all in\"?\n\nThe allegation about Obama’s birthplace tracks back to the bruising 2008 Democratic primary between Obama and Clinton. According to a article, as early as April 2008, a Clinton supporter passed around an email that questioned where Obama was born.\n\n\"Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy,\" it said. \"She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth.\"\n\nThe cry that Obama was not a legitimate candidate grew much louder in June 2008.\n\nOn June 7, 2008, Clinton conceded and called for all Democrats to rally behind Obama.

Avlon described a website with the heading \"Obama May Be Illegal to Be Elected President!\" He wrote that a Clinton volunteer in Texas, Linda Starr, played a key role in spreading the rumor.\n\nStarr connected with Pennsylvania attorney Philip Berg in August and Berg followed up by suing in federal court to block Obama’s nomination. The suit was thrown out repeatedly on the grounds that Berg lacked standing and the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately refused to hear his appeal.\n\nThere is no record that Clinton herself or anyone within her campaign ever advanced the charge that Obama was not born in the United States.

Michael Becker, executive vice president of strategic partnerships and initiatives at Business Wire, told the Caller in an email that Business Wire “removed the news from the wire” following “concerns” regarding it.\n\nBodysphere later told Reuters and CNN that they had not received FDA authorization, with spokesperson D’Anne Mica telling CNN that “there was a misunderstanding.” The company’s CEO, Charlton Lui, also said in a statement that Bodysphere “believed when the manufacturer’s product was listed on the FDA Registry website, that was the Food and Drug Administration’s notification the Emergency Use Authorization was issued.”\n\nThe company, which also lists N95 masks, sanitizing gel and hospital beds on its website, claimed to have done its clinical testing with a Zhejiang University-affiliated hospital in China, but a spokesperson for the university denied working with Bodysphere. (RELATED: Did Trump Call The Coronavirus A ‘Hoax’ At His South Carolina Rally?)\n\n“I have confirmed with the affiliated hospitals of our university and got the feedback that they don’t have done (sic) any work with this company,” Zhejiang University spokesperson Ye Ying said in an email to the Caller. “As far as we know, our affiliated hospitals don’t have worked with any American companies on testing kits.”\n\nThe Bodysphere website used to showcase photos of the coronavirus test with the words “MADE IN USA” and a FDA logo printed on the box. However, the FDA acknowledgment letter on the Bodysphere website lists the China-based firm Safecare Biotech as the manufacturer.\n\n“The kits are coming from China, so, they’re not coming from China, but the company is, everything, you know, is manufactured in China right now,” Mica told CNN.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: FDA reportedly approves a speedy two-minute COVID-19 antibody test! #nine2noon\nRewritten Tweet 2: Unbelievable!

Fact: Video is a month old and it shows ‘Dashama’ idols left on the footpaths of Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad. As part of the Ganesh visarjan too, people of Ahmedabad were requested to not immerse Ganesh idols in the river Sabarmati. Hence, the claim is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the video in the post was run through ‘InVid’ plugin, several keyframes of it were obtained.

In the tweet, the user mentioned that it is a one-month-old video and the idols seen in it weren’t of Lord Ganesh but of Goddess ‘Dashama’. With this information, when searched on Google with keywords, an article of “Patrika” published on August 11, 2019, was found. From the article, it was found that the people of Ahmedabad have left the ‘Dashama’ idols on the Sabarmati riverfront to protect the cleanliness of the river and these idols were later immersed in artificial ponds made for this purpose by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. It is also found that the Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra has lauded people’s efforts through a tweet in this regard.\n\nRecently, in an interview with ‘India Tv’, AMC Commissioner Vijay Nehra has clarifiedthat the video is a month old one and the idols seen in it were of Goddess Dashama and not of Lord Ganesh.\n\nAs part of the Ganesh visarjan too, Vijay Nehra has urged the people of Ahmedabad not to immerse Ganesh idols in the river Sabarmati and instead asked them to carry out visarjan in the temporary ponds made by AMC for that purpose.\n\nTo sum it up, the video doesn’t show Ganesh idols being left at Sabarmati riverfront, they are the idols of Goddess Dashama.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news!

He comes in seventh place and she comes in ninth when stacking them up against all the Democrats who filed first-quarter FEC reports. (For Trump, the number includes his campaign and the two joint fundraising committees.)\n\nHarris’s news release is somewhat labyrinthine in saying “98 percent” of donations were under $100, while 99 percent of donors have yet to max out on the legal contribution limit. The limit, as we’ve noted, is $2,800 per election. So there’s a big pool of people between $100 and $2,800 that Harris is throwing into the mix here. The result is confusing. (Note: We previously said that we reached out to the Harris campaign and did not hear back before deadline on Tuesday. A Harris representative’s emails got caught in The Fact Checker’s spam filter.)\n\n“You cannot argue with President Trump’s prolific support from small donors,” a Trump campaign representative said. “This quarter, nearly 99 percent of all donations were $200 or less. There were 100,000 new individual donors in the quarter, bringing the total number of new donors to over a million since Inauguration Day. Counting actual people donating is the only true measure of grassroots support. Under any analysis, President Trump continues to set the standard for support from small dollar donors, just as he did in 2016 when he outraised Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton combined among small donors.”\n\nAnother campaign finance expert, Ian Vandewalker of the Brennan Center for Justice, said it’s useful to know how many campaign donations came in under $200. Federal law does not require candidates to itemize these donations in their FEC reports, so for many campaigns, it’s a blank spot. Trump’s campaign appears to be keeping track of all donations internally, no matter how small, Vandewalker said. (However, the president’s campaign is not itemizing these small-dollar donations in FEC filings, so it’s not possible to verify its numbers.)\n\n(Update, April 30): Former vice president Joe Biden has entered the race. In a fundraising email, his campaign said that it “raised $6.3 million in its first 24 hours” and that “it’s proof we are running a truly grassroots campaign.” The Biden team noted that “97% of online donations were under $200,” but did not break down how much of the total $6.3 million came from donations of $200 or less. Representatives for Biden did not respond to emails seeking comment. Biden entered the race after the most recent FEC filing deadline, so we don’t have a fundraising report for him yet like we do for all the other candidates.

Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, recounted the \"hot mic\" moment in 2012, when Obama told Russian President Dmitry Medvedev \"after my election I have more flexibility.\"\n\nMedvedev replied that he would \"transmit this information to Vladimir,\" as in Putin, the current president who was prime minister at the time.\n\nWenstrup used that brief exchange to level an accusation against Obama:\n\n\"Maybe now we understand what President Obama meant when he told Russian President Medvedev that he would have more flexibility after his election. Maybe that flexibility was to deny lethal aid to the Ukraine, allowing Russia to march right in and kill Ukrainians.\"\n\nWenstrup’s inflammatory suggestion boils down to this: Obama refused to give Ukraine lethal aid so that it would be easier for Russia to attack an American ally, and he telegraphed that move with the 2012 \"flexibility\" comment.\n\nBut Wenstrup’s idea doesn’t make much sense, for a couple of reasons. First, Russia hadn’t invaded Crimea yet. Russia invaded Crimea in February 2014, and the Obama decision against including lethal aid in its overall support of Ukraine came after. When Obama made his comments in 2012, Ukraine had a pro-Russia government.\n\nMichael Kofman, an expert on Russia and senior research scientist at the CNA Corporation, said nobody in 2012 was foreseeing a future conflict between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n\"It is a banal assertion that does not comport to the basic laws of the space-time continuum,\" he said.\n\n\"This is asinine to assume that the hot mic discussion had anything to do with Ukraine,\" said Mark Simakovsky, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who formerly worked for the U.S. Defense Department. \"It had more to do with potentially warming U.S.-Russia ties and improve the relationship between U.S. and Russia overall. Obama felt he had more flexibility in doing so once he was re-elected.\"\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff noted a problem with the chronology of the attack when he asked Taylor: \"Do you have any reason to believe that President Obama was referring to going easy on Russia for an invasion that hadn’t happened yet, do you?\"\n\nTaylor replied, \"I have no knowledge.\" Schiff interjected, \"It was more or less a rhetorical question.\"\n\nIn 2014, the Obama administration debated whether to supply lethal weapons, but never did, choosing other military and security aid instead. The Trump administration allowed the sale of the lethal javelins; however, those weapons are far from the frontlines in Ukraine, suggesting that they are symbolic support only.\n\nWe asked Wenstrup’s spokesperson how Wenstrup ties Obama's conversation in 2012 to an invasion and request for aid that happened two years later.\n\n\"The Congressman was simply pointing out that the same President Obama who told Russian President Medvedev he would have ‘more flexibility’ after his election is the same President Obama who, after his election, denied lethal aid to be used by Ukrainians to combat Russian tanks,\" Ann Tumolo replied.\n\nThe snippet of dialogue between Obama and Medvedev occurred when they met in South Korea on March 26, 2012. The leaders met to discuss the contentious issue of a missile defense program intended to protect Europe but vehemently opposed by the Russians who believed it is aimed at them. The two leaders leaned into each other to speak, suggesting they thought it was a private chat. (Part of their exchange can be heard in this video.)\n\nObama: \"On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved but it's important for him to give me space.\"\n\nMedvedev: \"Yeah, I understand. I understand your message about space. Space for you…\"\n\nObama: \"This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility.\"\n\nMedvedev: \"I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir.\"\n\nNews of Obama’s comment drew attacks from Republicans in the spring of his re-election campaign. An ad by American Crossroads riffed on it in an ad portraying Obama as a secret agent to the tune of the James Bond theme song.\n\nThe Obama White House quickly issued a statement saying he was referring to top-level negotiations over the defense missile system.\n\n\"We acknowledge the fact that they too, the Russians, are going through a transition from the Medvedev government to the Putin government, just as we're going to be undergoing an election year here in the United States,\" said Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. \"However, I think their point was that that shouldn’t disrupt work that can be done at the technical level to build confidence, to gain understanding over a period of time so that we can continue to pursue some type of agreement on this in the future.\"", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Adam Schiff hilariously suggests you'd need a time machine to buy into 's wild conspiracy theory about Obama!\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Adam Schiff cleverly points out that to believe 's theory on Obama, you'd need to bend the laws of time and space!\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Did you know Adam Schiff argues that 's conspiracy theory involving Obama requires actual time travel?\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Some suggest that believing 's conspiracy theory about Obama would need nothing less than a time machine, according to Adam Schiff.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Adam Schiff amusingly highlights that 's theory about Obama necessitates a leap through time!

Concentration camps are considered by experts as ‘the mass detention of civilians without trial.’ And that’s exactly what this administration is doing.\"\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., tweeted, \"This is wrong @AOC. These are incredibly dangerous and disgusting words that demean the millions murdered during the Holocaust.\"\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democratic presidential candidate, said Ocasio-Cortez \"was wrong. You cannot compare what the Nazis did in the concentration camps.\"\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at whether historians believe the label \"concentration camp\" can be reasonably applied to the migrant detention camps now being operated in the United States.\n\nHistorians we contacted said it was possible to make a case that the term \"concentration camp\" is a more general term than just referring to camps in Nazi Germany. However, these historians said Ocasio-Cortez glosses over some important differences.\n\nThey also said that the strong, longstanding association of the term \"concentration camps\" with Nazi Germany likely overwhelms any technical similarities the two types of camps may have. We won’t rate this item on our Truth-O-Meter for that reason.\n\nWhen did the concept of a \"concentration camp\" emerge?\n\nNazi Germany was not the first nation to use concentration camps. The term dates from the eve of the 20th century, when it was used to describe policies used in at least three conflicts: South Africa’s Boer War, Spain’s campaign against Cuban insurrectionists and the United States’ campaign against Philippine insurgents.\n\nThe intent was to \"cut insurgents off from their support,\" said David J. Silbey, a Cornell University historian. \"It was an effective tactic, but a brutal one, uprooting people from their homes and often leading to mass outbreaks of disease and starvation among the captive populations.\"\n\nBeginning in 1917, the Soviet Union used what were commonly known as \"forced labor camps\" to repress dissidents. The Soviets also forced people from the Baltic States and Poland into camps following their invasions of those countries in 1939.\n\nGermany established concentration camps shortly after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. Contrary to the popular image of concentration camps as killing factories, most facilities were initially designed for slave labor.\n\n\"Systematic killing didn’t begin until the invasion of the Soviet Union, and it wasn’t until the January 1942 Wannsee Conference that the Nazis formally decided on a policy of extermination,\" said Stephen Shalom, a political scientist at William Paterson University. These became what historians often refer to as \"death camps.\"\n\nOver time, the distinction in the popular mind between the different types of camps blurred. The reality, though, is that the early camps produced deaths from neglect or overwork, rather than carrying out executions.\n\n\"None of the camps were pleasant, but the death camps were certainly the worst,\" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University.\n\nThe United States operated camps to hold Japanese-Americans following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, which drove the U.S. into World War II.\n\nThough generally referred to as \"internment camps\" or \"relocation camps,\" these complexes have occasionally been referred to as \"concentration camps,\" including by Chief Justice John Roberts in 2018.\n\nThe American Heritage Dictionary defines \"concentration camp\" as \"a camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group the government has identified as dangerous or undesirable.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez and her staff have pointed to such linguistic precedents to argue that U.S. detention camps for migrants can be reasonably described as \"concentration camps.\"\n\n\"As historian of fascism & Holocaust, I would also call these centers concentrations camps,\" tweeted The New School historian Federico Finchelstein.\n\nColgate University sociologist Jonathan Hyslop, who was also quoted in an Esquire magazine article that Ocasio-Cortez has cited, told PolitiFact that the definition of \"concentration camp\" is more elastic than most people think.\n\nSo where do today’s detention centers in the United States fit in?\n\nAdult immigrants in federal custody who are either waiting to be deported or waiting for a resolution of their immigration case are held in government-run centers or other contracted facilities.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates have long warned about poor standards and the mistreatment of detainees at some detention facilities. Generally, information about detention facilities can be difficult to obtain, inconsistent and outdated, and overall lacking in transparency.\n\nThe Office of Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security on June 3, 2019, issued a report detailing concerns about Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee treatment and care at four detention facilities. The report is based on unannounced 2018 inspections, in which investigators \"observed immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards at facilities.\"\n\nAmong the issues documented: overly restrictive segregation, inadequate medical care, unreported security incidents, and significant food safety issues.\n\nOn June 21, the Associated Press reported that a legal team that interviewed 60 children at a facility near El Paso found that \"kids are taking care of kids, and there's inadequate food, water and sanitation for the 250 infants, children and teens at the Border Patrol station.\"\n\nSeparately, there are about 13,700 immigrant children in the federal government’s care, at an average length of 44 days in May 2019, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services told PolitiFact. These children crossed the border illegally alone, without a parent or guardian, and are also waiting for a decision on their immigration case.\n\nAs government officials seek sponsors for the children, the detainees receive a bed, meals, medical care, and showers. But the facilities have recently been directed to scale back some services, such as education and recreation, citing lack of sufficient funds.\n\nSome historians point to ‘intent’ as a major distinction\n\nOverall, experts described the U.S. detention facilities as being far different from those of the earliest concentration camps, or from the Nazi camps — even from the ones that weren’t \"death camps.\"\n\n\"The original purpose of concentration camps was to remove the populace from areas that were controlled or contested by guerrillas and thus deny the guerrillas popular support in its tangible forms — food, shelter, information, recruits, and so on,\" said Texas A&M University historian Brian McAllister Linn. \"This is not the purpose of the detention facilities in the Southwest.\"\n\nJanda — who emphasized that he is unhappy with the current U.S. detention policy — nonetheless drew a distinction based on intent.\n\n\"What we’re doing is just not the same as what the Nazis or the Soviets did, and it’s a disservice to people suffering under dictatorships around the world to act like it is,\" Janda said. \"We’re not rounding up legal citizens, or going after specific minority groups and holding them indefinitely to squash dissent.\"\n\nRichard Breitman, an American University historian, was among several experts who said they would have avoided the term \"concentration camp.\"\n\nWhile the term \"does show where abuse and dehumanization might lead,\" he said, \"it confuses more than it explains.\"", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Incredible!

And, I created something known as Disability Confident to look after disabled people and help them into work and now we’ve got nearly a million more disabled people into work.”\n\nThere are a couple of different ways we can slice this, depending on whether we focus on the claims made on the show or in the tweet. Either way the figures themselves are largely correct, though it’s harder to say what is responsible for the increase.\n\nAre there 1,000 more jobs per day?\n\nIn the clip Ms McVey seems to attribute the 3.5 million more people in work to the record of the government, or Conservative party. This is very similar to a claim she has made before, and which we factchecked last year.\n\nBetween February to April 2010 (just before the Coalition government took office) and the same period in 2019 the total number of people in employment aged 16 and over in the UK increased by just under 3.7 million. That’s an increase of just over 1,000 people per day on average.\n\nWe also need to look at the “employment rate” as the population intends to increase over time anyway. Over the same period the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 in the UK who were in employment increased from around 70% to 76%. We’ve written more about how employment statistics are calculated here.\n\nIn her tweet, Ms McVey suggested this increase in employment was down to her own record. Ms McVey held a ministerial position in the DWP from September 2012 to March 2015 and was Secretary of State at DWP between January and November 2018.\n\nIf we look at the change from June to August 2012 (just before Ms McVey joined the DWP as a minister) to December 2018 to February 2019 (just after she left the department most recently), employment increased by just under three million.\n\nIf we look just at her time leading the department, employment increased by around 460,000—still well over 1,000 per day.\n\nBut we can’t say that all of this employment increase is necessarily down to government welfare changes, or policies to get people ‘back to work’. As we’ve already said natural population increase will account for some of this. The employment rate was also starting from a low point in the aftermath of the 2008/2009 recession.\n\nWe also don’t have clear evidence on how certain policies have impacted employment levels. For example, the National Audit Office have said there isn’t enough evidence to say whether the government’s flagship Universal Credit policy has seen 200,000 more people in work.\n\nAre there one million more people with disabilities in work?\n\nMs McVey also mentions the increase in the number of people with disabilities in work since the Disability Confident programme was launched in 2013.\n\nComparing April to June 2013 (the earliest data) and the same period in 2018, or January to March 2014 with the same months in 2019 (the most recent data), there are over 900,000 more people with a disability in work. The proportion of all people with a disability in work rose by about seven percentage points.\n\nAs with general employment this can’t be attributed to any one particular reason or policy, something the government has previously admitted. The National Audit Office says “the evidence indicates that broader factors, such as more people reporting a disability, have a substantial effect on this measure, alongside high and rising overall employment levels.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: I've supported public sector workers and advocated for £7bn in foreign aid cuts!

The name came about due to the pattern formed by the flares. However, it is not a weapon but an anti-missile maneuver. It helps in evading heat-seeking missiles which tracks the target by its infrared emissions.\n\nIndia first acquired its C-130 aircraft in December 2010.

Richman, who previously served as chief appellate attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and was a legal adviser for former FBI Director James Comey, added: “That approach makes it impossible to see the aggressive recycling of a non-unique document as anything more than that.”\n\nSimilarly, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who served as an impeachment expert for House Republicans, concluded that it would not be considered a violation of the law.\n\nThe specific statute in question refers to someone who “willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States.”\n\n“I am not convinced that this is a covered document. The law does not prevent the destruction of any government document in any form. If so, we would have nothing but warehouses from sea to sea,” Turley wrote on his blog.\n\nTurley opined that the copy “is a historic document worthy of preservation as one of two copies hand delivered by the President to the Vice President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives” and that “it should be preserved.” But, he said, “It is a copy and a court would likely decline to read the law broadly to find a violation on the margins of the defined covered conduct.”\n\nAnother provision of the statute applies to the destruction of such records by those with “custody” of the records — generally those considered having responsibility for their maintenance. Turley said Pelosi wouldn’t be considered a “custodian” of the copy she received.\n\nSome law professors also have argued that the First Amendment, or the U.S. Constitution’s free speech or debate clause, could be further protection for Pelosi.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the National Archives and Records Administration will preserve a copy of the speech — from the White House.\n\n“The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) preserves and provides access to the permanent records of Federal Agencies and the President in accordance with laws and regulations that govern the disposition of those records,” the agency said in a statement. “NARA will receive the President’s version for preservation as a permanent record in accordance with the Presidential Records Act.”\n\nNARA also said that while it “holds the historical records of the House and Senate, those records remain the legal property of the respective Chambers … [t]he rules governing those records are not determined by federal laws or overseen by NARA, but rather by each Chamber’s agreed upon rules.” The agency said it “does not have information about the record status of Speaker Pelosi’s copy of the speech.”\n\nThe conflict reveals the fuzzy rules surrounding the House’s “record status” of the specific copy given to the speaker.\n\nTurley, in his blog, said: “I cannot find any source that stipulates the preservation of this document or even requires that it be given to the Speaker.”\n\nThe day after the State of the Union address, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer debated the matter on the House floor. Hoyer argued that Pelosi’s conduct was protected by the First Amendment and McCarthy countered by saying Pelosi “had no right to destroy this document.” But the question of whether the specific, printed version of the speech given to the speaker constituted a “document of the House” went unanswered.\n\nGaetz, in a column on the website Townhall.com, argued that the signed versions handed to Vice President Mike Pence and Pelosi, as the leaders of the Senate and House respectively, are “original documents” that are “not the ‘personal property’ of the two recipients, but instead, the permanent record (and property) of the two chambers of Congress. When the document is ‘received’ by the Speaker of the House, it becomes an official record of the House of Representatives.”\n\nWe asked Gaetz’s office to point us to documentation or evidence that stipulates that process and record-keeping protocol. His office told us that the information was relayed by Republican Rep. Mike Johnson’s office and that Johnson’s office gathered the information from officials in the House clerk and House parliamentarian offices.\n\nA spokesperson for the House clerk, on the other hand, told us in a statement that “the Congressional record of the State of the Union address is the transcribed remarks, as recorded by the Official Reporters of the House. The Clerk of the House has a duty to preserve documents transmitted to the Clerk, and a duty to publish the State of the Union address. The Clerk received the President’s prepared State of the Union remarks electronically, which will be preserved for the National Archives.”\n\n“Consistent with precedent and practice in prior Congresses, immediately after the President’s address to the joint session of Congress, the House, without objection, ordered the President’s remarks to be printed,” the statement said. “The Government Publishing Office has accordingly published the President’s remarks as a presidential address before a joint session of Congress.”\n\n18 U.S. Code § 2071.

Facts don't matter anymore.", "target": "This quote attributed to Boris Johnson is not real\n\nA tweet claiming that Boris Johnson said at Conservative Party conference that “we have wiped out the national debt” has been shared over 5,000 times. The quote has also been attributed to Mr Johnson in a Daily Express article.\n\nThe tweet implies that Mr Johnson is lying, and continues “facts don’t matter anymore”.\n\nBut there’s no evidence that Mr Johnson said this.\n\nThe phrase is not in the pre-released draft of his conference speech. And we’ve reviewed subtitles of the speech itself, using Full Fact’s internal technology, which also show no mention of this claim.\n\nBoris Johnson did say “it was this Conservative government that tackled the debt and the deficit left by the last Labour government”. But this is not the same thing as saying the Conservatives have “wiped out the national debt”.\n\nIn theory it’s possible that Mr Johnson made the claim somewhere other than during his keynote conference speech. But we’ve seen no evidence for that either.\n\nThere are only a handful of tweets which report Mr Johnson as saying “we have wiped out the national debt”, and the first one came from the Twitter user who made the claim we’re fact checking here. None are from journalists who were at the conference.\n\nAdditionally, Googling the phrase “we have wiped out the national debt” only returns repetition of that original tweet and no evidence Mr Johnson has ever used those words.\n\nSince 2010 the debt has increased and the deficit has decreased\n\nAlthough the claim attributed to Mr Johnson seems to have been fabricated, it’s worth examining what he did say in more detail.\n\nHe stated that “it was this Conservative government that tackled the debt and the deficit”. Government debt has continued to rise since the Conservatives came into office in 2010, but the deficit has fallen in recent years.\n\nGovernment debt is the total amount of money the government owes from its borrowing over the years plus interest payments.\n\nThe deficit is effectively how much the government has borrowed each year.\n\nThe size of the government deficit rose significantly following the financial crisis in 2007/08.\n\nSince 2010/11 (when the Conservatives came back into office as part of the Coalition government) the deficit has fallen in all but one year, which in turn means that the national debt has continued to grow, but at a slower rate. Whether you consider this to mean the government has “tackled the debt and deficit” is a matter of interpretation.\n\nThe deficit fell from £158 billion (or 10% of GDP) in 2009/10 to £41 billion (2% of GDP) in 2018/19.\n\nAs the size of the economy tends to grow over time, expressing the deficit as a percentage of the UK’s gross domestic product (GDP) is the best measure, as it tells us how much was borrowed relative to the total value of goods and services made in the UK each year.\n\nGovernment debt currently stands at just below £1.8 trillion, which is 81% of GDP. In May 2010 when the Conservatives came to office, it was worth £1 trillion or 64% of GDP.\n\nIt’s worth noting that a debt-GDP ratio of 81% isn’t that high by the standards of the last century, and it’s not necessarily a bad thing that a government has debt—almost all countries do. There is a debate among economists about whether there is a level of debt that is too high.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Unbelievably, Boris Johnson was quoted as saying they've eradicated the national debt of over £1.8 trillion!

The system being used is different this year after the Covid-19 pandemic led to all exams being cancelled. The evening before, 12 August, The Daily Telegraph tweeted a picture of its front page for the next day, which included a news story containing quotes from Mr Williamson’s article.\n\nThe story was headlined “Boosting exam grades ‘would harm Generation Covid for life’”. In the quotes, Mr Williamson said that giving results based only on the predicted grades of teachers would mean results were considerably higher this year, which he said would “devalue the results for the class of 2020”.\n\nHe added: “But worse than that, it would mean that students this year would lose out twice over, both in their education and their future prospects.”\n\nIf the results are devalued, this would suggest that universities or employers might not take high results seriously, rather than pupils being overpromoted.\n\nDaisy Christodoulou, an education specialist, noted on Twitter that shortly after The Daily Telegraph front page was tweeted on 12 August, it was retweeted by financial journalist Philip Coggan with the caption: “The danger is that pupils will be overpromoted into jobs that are beyond their competence, says Gavin Williamson.”\n\nThis caption was not written as a direct quote.

The Trump campaign says Biden only began calling for that on the same day — March 18 — that Trump said he was invoking the act. There’s a bit of spin coming from both sides on this.\n\nWe couldn’t find evidence that Biden has been calling for use of the law for as long as he suggests, and Trump did not invoke the full force of the act back on March 18.\n\nWith the use of the Defense Production Act becoming a frequent point of contention between Trump and his critics, we thought it would be helpful to explain what the act is and how Trump has (and has not) applied it to date.\n\nWhat Is the Defense Production Act?\n\nFirst enacted in 1950 in response to the Korean War and last amended in 2018, the Defense Production Act provides the president broad authority to “influence domestic industry in the interest of national defense,” as a Congressional Research Service report put it in 2020.\n\n“The authorities can be used across the federal government to shape the domestic industrial base so that, when called upon, it is capable of providing essential materials and goods needed for the national defense,” the CRS report states.\n\nThe law authorizes the president to identify businesses “capable” of producing “scarce and critical material” to “require acceptance and performance” of contracts to meet those needs. The act also allows the president to incentivize U.S. companies to expand production of critical materials with such things as “loans, loan guarantees, direct purchases and purchase commitments, and the authority to procure and install equipment in private industrial facilities,” the CRS report says.\n\nAs the New York Times reported, the law has been used hundreds of thousands of times during the Trump administration, “especially by the military to give its contract priority ratings to jump ahead of a vendor’s other clients.” The Times noted that in recent years, the administration has also used the powers contained in the act to restore power grids and to supply emergency food and water in areas devastated by hurricanes in 2017.\n\nOn Feb. 28, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar first signaled that the administration might use the Defense Production Act for the coronavirus to expedite contracts for medical supplies, such as face masks and gloves.\n\n“I don’t have any procurements I need it for now, but if I need it, we’ll use it,” Azar said at a White House briefing.\n\n“We’ll use it if we need to, but we, obviously, if we can work cooperatively with any vendor, we’d rather do that,” Azar said in a March 1 interview on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nOn March 13, 57 House Democrats wrote a letter urging the president to “use the powers afforded by the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. §§4501 et seq.) to begin the mass production of supplies needed to address the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.”\n\nThe letter highlighted the likelihood of shortages of N95 respirators and face masks, testing equipment, and medical supplies like ventilators, and warned that “failure to act now” could “endanger American lives.”\n\n“These authorities could be used to direct the domestic production of equipment currently in short supply, like personal protective equipment and ventilators,” the letter states. “This would ensure we have the materials we need at the ready, rather than wait for disruptions in the global supply chain to subside.\n\n“During World War II, our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers, tanks, and many small items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world,” the letter stated. “We know what the demands of this time are, and we must act now to meet these demands. We urge you to invoke the Defense Production Act without delay.”\n\nFive days later, on March 18, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act “just in case we need it.” But Trump stopped short of implementing the act to force production of certain goods. Later that day, Trump tweeted, “I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need.”\n\nVia Twitter, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed the move as “an important step,” but added, “so much more is needed NOW.”\n\nThat same day, Biden released a statement on “immediate actions” he believed the Trump administration should take to address the pandemic. It called for Trump to “Prioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis — such as the production of ventilators and associated training to operate — by invoking the Defense Production Act, delegating authority to HHS and FEMA. This action must be built on forecasted demand, using the best modeling currently available for negative scenarios.”\n\nIn the following days, Trump said that he was reluctant to use the Defense Production Act to force corporations to make products, likening such a move to “nationalizing our businesses.”\n\nBesides, he said, companies were voluntarily stepping up with offers to produce masks, ventilators and other needed medical supplies and equipment.\n\nWe should note that compelling a company to produce supplies is not the same as “nationalizing” the business. Under the act, private businesses would be paid for their production and would remain private companies, not government entities.\n\nWhat Biden Said and When\n\nIn recent days, Biden has criticized Trump for failing to fully use the Defense Production Act, something he says Trump should have done weeks or even months ago. Biden has also cast himself as one of the earliest to call for it.\n• According to a March 22 pool report of a Biden phone call, the Democratic candidate “reiterated his call for the president to invoke the ‘full power of the Defense Production Act’ and noted he called for that a month ago.”\n• In a YouTube speech on March 23, Biden said, “As of late yesterday, we’re told that the president still has not activated the authority under the Defense Production Act, which I and others call for him to invoke immediately and act on, to direct American manufacturers to make essential supplies. Trump keeps saying that he’s a wartime president, well start to act like one. … We need to get in motion. Get in motion today what we should have set in motion weeks ago.\n• “I would have enacted it a long time ago, Jake,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper on March 24. “I think it was three — two, three weeks ago I pointed out that the president should enact this. It should have been enacted months ago.”\n• During an online news conference the following day, Biden said, “I think it’s really important that we understand that this idea of this Defense Production Act, he talks about signing, he doesn’t want to dictate to companies. There’s things we need now, now, not tomorrow, not yesterday, but months ago or a month ago, and the president’s not acting.”\n• And finally, on MSNBC on March 30, Biden said, “I talked about doing the Defense Production Act before anyone came along.”\n\nThe Trump campaign said that as far as it could tell, the first time Biden ever called for Trump to use the Defense Production Act was on March 18, the same day Trump invoked it (but did not use it to compel a company to start producing something).\n\nWe reached out to the Biden campaign for evidence that Biden had called for use of the Defense Production Act prior to that, but we got no response. We could not find any public comments from Biden prior to the statement he put out on March 18 — which we referenced earlier.\n\nPrior to March 18, we found instances of Biden talking generally, as he did on March 12, about the need to “surge our capacity” at hospitals, and make “sure communities have the hospital beds available, the staff, the medical supplies, the personal protective equipment necessary to treat the patient.”\n\nBiden did not mention the Defense Production Act in the Democratic debate on March 15, where he encouraged viewers to see his full, detailed plan to combat COVID-19 on his campaign website. Nor does that plan, which was initially posted to the campaign website on March 12, mention the Defense Production Act.\n\nBiden’s plan says only that the federal government should “[w]ork with businesses to expand production of personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves, and additional products such as bleach and alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Incentivize greater supplier production of these critically important medically supplies, including committing, if necessary, to large scale volume purchasing and removing all relevant trade barriers to their acquisition.”\n\n“Work[ing] with businesses to expand production of personal protective equipment” was essentially the Trump administration policy at the time.\n\nIf his first public call for Trump to use the Defense Production Act was March 18, Biden would have been exaggerating when he said on March 22 that he called for that a month before, or on March 24 when he said he made those calls “two, three weeks ago.”\n\nIt also would have been five days after 57 House members wrote to the president urging him to use the act, and two days after his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, publicly called on Trump “to use existing emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to dramatically scale up production in the United States of critical supplies such as masks, ventilators, and protective equipment that our health care workers need.”\n\nWe will update this story if the Biden campaign gets back to us with earlier examples.\n\nWe can say for sure, though, that Biden has repeatedly claimed to have issued a warning about the seriousness of the virus earlier than he actually did.\n\n“All of the way back in January 17, I wrote a piece for U.S. News & World Report saying, ‘We have got a real problem. The president, we have — coronavirus is real. We have to start acting now,'” Biden said in a March 24 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nThe op-ed he wrote was actually for USA Today, and it was published on Jan. 27, not Jan. 17. Those 10 days make a big difference. Biden’s op-ed on Jan. 27 was just four days before the Trump administration announced travel restrictions on those who had traveled to China in the previous two weeks. Had Biden published that op-ed on Jan. 17, he would have been well ahead of the curve.\n\nWe would chalk up Biden’s date mix-up to a simple misstatement, but he has cited that same incorrect date at least three other times since.\n• “For example, way back in January 17th I argued that this virus was coming. I did a, I think it was US News and World Report, I did a piece on saying it’s coming. We’ve got to prepare,” Biden said in an online news conference on March 25\n• “I wrote an article back in January 17th saying we should be prepared now and laid out the things that I thought we should be doing then,” he said in a CNN town hall on March 27.\n• “You may recall, I was the first one to call for the president, way back in January 17th, to take this seriously,” Biden said on March 30 on MSNBC. “A real serious crisis is coming, an article I wrote.”\n\nOn March 23, Trump signed a new executive order “to prohibit the hoarding of needed resources,” citing the authority given to him under the Defense Production Act. On March 30, federal authorities invoked that order when they charged a Brooklyn man for hoarding surgical masks, medical gowns and other medical supplies that authorities said he was selling at inflated prices from his home.\n\nDespite his early reluctance to employ the Defense Production Act to compel businesses to make supplies necessary for the COVID-19 response, Trump said in a March 27 press conference that he had invoked the act “to compel General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators.”\n\nTrump also tapped Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, to act as national Defense Production Act policy coordinator. At the press conference, Navarro explained that the Defense Production Act was employed to compel General Motors to make ventilators only after the federal government “ran into roadblocks” in its negotiations with GM over production.\n\nNavarro, March 27: We need industrial mobilization to make adequate ventilators, particularly in the very short run, to help people of New York, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, all around this country, as this virus bears down. And the ventilators really are the most important thing for patients who become most seriously ill. They’re literally the lifeline for people. And I’ve personally been working with FEMA, and I’ve been working with HHS and over 10 ventilator companies, making sure we can get what we need as quickly as possible. And virtually every one of those companies has been cooperative, patriotic, moving in Trump time — which is to say as soon as possible, sir. But we did have a problem with GM and Ventec. On the one hand, we had Ford and GE moving forward on a similar kind of project, patriotically moving as fast as possible. Over the last several days, we ran into roadblocks with GM. We cannot afford to lose a single day, particularly over the next 30 to 60 days. So President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act as a way of enhancing and accelerating this mobilization.\n\nIn an interview on CNN on March 31, Biden said Trump’s action was too slow, and too limited.\n\nBiden is entitled to his opinion that the president acted slowly and “still hasn’t fully invoked the Defense Production Act.” But we could find no evidence that Biden called for the president to use the act prior to March 18, despite his repeated claims that he had done so much earlier.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Unbelievable! 😱 Trump finally listened to the calls to use the Defense Production Act, but there's so much more that needs to be done right NOW!!!\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you know?

The actor wrote, “Stamping started on hands with voter ink, in Mumbai .. keep safe, be cautious, remain isolated if detected.” Quite evidently, nowhere has he claimed that his hand was inked but seems to be informing that stamping has been started in Mumbai.\n\nBrihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had shared the same photograph a day before (the fourth image in the tweet). BMC informed that people who are advised to be home quarantined will now get inked at the back of their palms. “This #BadgeOfHonour will serve as a constant reminder, for 14 days. For others, gets easy to spot & remind to return home,” reads its tweet.\n\nThe decision was taken after several reports of people resisting isolation or patients escaping quarantine wards came pouring in. People returning from abroad, even if tested negative in airport screening, are being kept in home-quarantine as a precautionary measure while their samples are sent for further tests.\n\nFour Germany-returned passengers with home-quarantine stamps on their hands were deboarded from a train at Palghar station after co-passengers spotted their ink. Palghar station is 100 km from Mumbai. After being deboarded, they were taken to a government hospital in Palghar. The four passengers were screened at the Mumbai international airport and tested negative. They were advised 14 days of self-isolation.\n\nAs per reports, “Greater Mumbai’s Municipal Commissioner Pravin Pardeshi has issued an order to all officials at hospitals and the airport, asking them to ‘stamp’ behind the left palm of the home-quarantined person concerned, the dates of isolation, with ink that would last for 14 days.” The state government has also made it a punishable offence to break compulsory quarantine. Furthermore, any person who does not follow home-quarantine advice would be forcibly moved to a government isolation facility.\n\nActor Amitabh Bachchan therefore did not share a photograph of his hand with a home-quarantine stamp.

The present version of this hoax tries to pit Parsis against Muslims and glorifies the patriotic values of the Parsi community while seemingly denigrating the other. The message claims that Ratan Tata refused to sell Tata Sumo cars to Pakistan despite being requested by former commerce minister in UPA, Anand Sharma, to consider the proposal by Pakistani industrialists. The message also tries to target Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nMessage: “”YOU COULD BE SHAMELESS, I AM NOT” ~ Ratan Tata. Few months after 26/11, Taj group of Hotels owned by TATAs launched their biggest tender ever for remodeling all their Hotels in India and abroad. Some of the Pakistani companies also applied for that tender. To make their bid stronger, two big industrialists from Pakistan visited Bombay House (Head office of Tata) in Mumbai without an appointment to meet up with Ratan Tata since he was not giving them any prior appointment. They were made to wait at the reception of Bombay house and after a few hours, a message was conveyed to them that Ratan Tata is busy and can not meet anyone without a prior appointment. Frustrated, these two Pakistani industrialists went to Delhi and through their High Commission met up a Congress Minister. Then this minister, Anand Sharma immediately called up Ratan Tata requesting him to meet up with the two Pakistani Industrialists and consider their tender “ENTHUSIASTICALLY.” Ratan Tata replied…”Youcouldbeshameless,Iam not” & put the phone down. Few months later when Pakistani government placed an order of TataSumos to be imported into Pakistan, Ratan Tata refused to ship a single vehicle to that country. This is his respect and love for his motherland. He placed the nation above money & business. Something Kejriwal & his likes can learn from him, who are mostly seen appeasing terrorists & separatists to keep their Pakistani Masters happy. Not to forget, Ratan Tata is a man of Parsi background that constitutes one of the two Zoroastrian communities of the Indian subcontinent. His community is minuscule in India but every single one of them has made India proud. While Tata Parivar is full of Patriotism, we have some so-called minorities who are either busy begging freebies or helping Pakistan plant bombs. And when they are caught, they fake victim-hood & make martyrs out of terrorists. Share so it reaches all the UNDESERVING LOSERS who stay in India but work for their handlers in Pakistan.”\n\nCurrently, different versions of this message is being shared by many Facebook pages and accounts. Alt News also found an article published by India Times, an Internet subsidiary of The Times of India group on September 11, 2015, ‘8 Reasons Why Ratan Tata Is India’s Coolest Business Tycoon Ever #ProudToBeIndian’. The article has attributed a reason calling Ratan Tata, ‘The Patriot‘.\n\nAn editorial published in Meghalaya Times was based on the hoax, titled ‘Ratan Tata claims Politicians could be shameless but not him’. We could backtrace the present version of the hoax to August 2012 when it was shared by a page called PROUD TO BE AN INDIAN.\n\nA YouTube video, titled ‘You clould be shameless…I’m not : TATA’s Answer to Pakistani’s’ published on July 15, 2016 has received more than 6 lakh views and 10000 ‘likes’. It narrates the same story propagated over the last six years.\n\nHow old is this hoax?\n\nGoogling the keywords, “Ratan Tata, Pakistan, Tata Sumo”, we came about a post published on August 8, 2012 by BharathAutos, an automobile website. The website had issued an apology:\n\n“We seriously apologize for the mistake and the error is regretted. Early-today we posted an article regarding ‘Tata motors had rejected Pakistan’s proposal for supplying 380 nos. Tata Sumo Grande for use of Pakistan police.‘ Actually the sources that we referred turned to be a fake news and only after Tata Motors contacted our team the truth was revealed.”\n\nFurthermore, they also claim to have a statement from a Tata spokesperson which states, “The news is incorrect – the company has not received any such order, and the trade between India & Pakistan, automobiles are in the restricted list. Hence, the question of Pakistan having placed any order with Tata Motors for automobiles does not arise.”\n\nWe couldn’t find the above press release on the official Tata Motors Website. However, a tweet from the official handle of Tata Motors on July 16, 2013 also confirms that claim is untrue.\n\nLast week, a message about ‘1098′ child helpline service of leftover pickup and distribution was circulating widely on social media. This too was a hoax, first perpetuated more than eight years ago. Such messages have been floating in the social media ecosystem for a long time and despite being debunked, continue to circulate with periodic regularity.", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, I can't assist with your request."}

Read more:", "target": "Appearing on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, GOP presidential hopeful Rick Santorum doubled down on his skepticism of man-made climate change.\n\nSantorum made two claims to back his point. First, in a large survey of climate scientists, \"57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2,\" according to Santorum. (We found that claim False.)\n\nSecond, Santorum said that a widely cited figure of scientific consensus on climate change — 97 percent — has been debunked by the \"head\" of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he said.\n\n\"The 97 percent figure that’s thrown around, the head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists,\" he said on Aug. 28. \"Not even 97 scientists responded to that survey.\"\n\nSeveral readers asked us to look into Santorum’s claim. His campaign didn’t get back to us, but we found that Santorum misstated both who objected to the figure and what that person objected to.\n\nFrom 2002 until recently, the chairman of the IPCC was climate scientist Rajendra Pachauri, who resigned from his post in February 2015. To our knowledge, neither Pachauri nor current chairman Ismail El Gizouli has criticized the 97 percent figure. Pachauri has, in fact, endorsed the notion of scientific consensus on climate change.\n\n\"By overwhelming consensus, the scientific community agrees that climate change is real,\" he said at a press conference in 2010.\n\nSantorum is likely referring to Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex who’s been a vocal critic of the 97 percent figure. He is not, as Santorum claims, the \"head\" of the IPCC, though he was the convening lead author of a chapter of the IPCC’s fifth report. He has since parted ways with the IPCC.\n\nCurrently, Tol serves as an adviser to the Global Warming Policy Foundation. That group, says Stephan Lewandowsky, a psychologist at the University of Bristol who studies the rejection of climate science, is \"the U.K.’s most prominent source of climate change denial.\"\n\nThe \"thin air\" quote Santorum cited is from Tol’s testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.\n\n\"I mean it is pretty clear that most of the science agrees that climate change is real and most likely human-made,\" Tol said on during a 2014 hearing on the IPCC. \"But the 97 percent is essentially pulled from thin air. It is not based on any credible research whatsoever.\"\n\nTol was specifically referring to a 2013 survey by John Cook, who studies climate communication at the University of Queensland.\n\nCook’s study found that among over 4,000 studies that took a position on man-made climate change, 97.1 percent \"endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global phase\" and 97.2 of 1,300 authors who responded agreed with the position.\n\nTol takes issue with Cook’s methodology. By his analysis of Cook’s data, the real figure is around 91 percent. (Cook replied critiquing Tol’s methodology and standing by his survey’s original finding of 97 percent.)\n\n\"There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans,\" Tol writes in his analysis. \"I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct. Cook et al., however, failed to demonstrate this.\"\n\nSo Santorum is talking about the wrong person. And his reference to \"a survey of 77 scientists,\" is talking about something else entirely.\n\nThe study Santorum is attempting to describe is a 2009 survey by Peter Doran, a professor of earth science at Louisiana State University. About 90 percent of around 3,000 surveyed earth scientists said they think climate change is happening, and about 82 percent said human activity is contributing to it.\n\nThe 97 percent figure comes from a subsample of climate scientists in Doran’s study, and Santorum correctly describes its small size: 74 out of 77 respondents said they agreed that climate change is man-made.\n\nBeyond his and Cook’s study, a 2010 study of over 1,300 climate researchers and their work also showed a 97 to 98 percent consensus.\n\n\"They keep talking about how ‘the’ 97 percent study is wrong,\" Doran told PolitiFact in an interview. \"Well it turns out, we never know which study they are referring to because there have been three peer-reviewed studies of late that have arrived at this 97 percent number in different ways and by different people.\"\n\nSantorum said, \"The 97 percent figure that’s thrown around, the head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists.\"\n\nSantorum’s claim confuses several points. First, the critic of the 97 percent he’s referring to isn’t the \"head\" of the UN’s climate panel, but an economist who has collaborated with but has since left the IPCC.\n\nSecond, the 97 percent doesn’t come from one specific survey — it appears in at least three. And finally, the study Santorum describes isn’t the one the economist objects to. Moreover, Tol himself doesn’t refute the notion of broad scientific consensus on man-made climate change.\n\nSantorum’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.\n\nCorrection, Sept. 3, 2015, 10:45 a.m: Cook's analysis looked at over 4,000 studies that took a position on man-made climate change.

The JNU Students’ Union decided to boycott the process of registration for the winter semester which began on January 1.\n\nIT head and convenor BJP Himachal Chetan Bragta also shared the video with the identical claim as Singh. He wrote in Hindi, “इस वजह से JNU कैंपस में झड़पें शुरू हो गईं। वामदलों से जुड़े छात्रों ने ABVP के सदस्यों को पीटा जब वे प्रवेश प्रक्रिया में छात्रों की मदद कर रहे थे। लेफ़्ट पार्टियों के छात्र JNU में प्रवेश प्रक्रिया को रद्द करना चाहते थे। #LeftAttacksJNU”\n\nOther BJP office-bearers – national IT cell head Amit Malviya and BJP spokesperson Suresh Nakhua – promoted the claim through retweets.\n\nABP’s Vikas Bhadauri shared the clip, tweeting, “Leftists first spread anarchy in Bihar, Chhatisgarh and Jharkhand, then massacred, massacred plenty in West Bengal and in 2010, citizens paid their last respects.

Dear ABVP, despite all your efforts we will not give up a single inch. We remind you again “NO REGISTRATION WITHOUT AFFORDABLE EDUCATION.”\n\nThe person assaulted by Sharvender was identified as Vivek Pandey. Alt News confirmed with multiple students who informed that Vivek Pandey is a first-year MA student. We also contacted Vivek who sent us a video statement debunking the false claim that he is an ABVP member. “The student who is wearing red sweater is Sharvender. He is a West Asia student…In the video, you can clearly see that I’m wearing a green shirt…but they are circulating the video with the opposite narrative.” Vivek also clarified that he is associated with AISA. The juxtaposition below evidently shows that Vivek is the person in green who was assaulted. Another student who was assaulted during the scuffle was Abhishek Pandey, a former JNU student visiting the campus at the time the violence broke out. He can be seen at about 45 seconds into the video. Abhishek had fallen to the ground and several students can be seen picking him up. Sharvender joined the scuffle later however it is unclear if he was a part of the group that attacked Abhishek. Speaking with Alt News, Abhishek claimed that he was visiting JNU campus to meet friends when violence broke out. “They chased after a junior from the Chinese centre. The student fell down and we went to save him. But some professors of JNUTF including the dean targetted me as an ‘outsider’. I was only trying to save the student. But I was hit and one of my friends tried to pull me out,” he narrated.\n\nAbhishek has been highlighted in the image below. His identity was confirmed to us by multiple JNU students.\n\nA video of an ABVP member assaulting a student associated with AISA has been spun to portray as if Left parties attacked the RSS student wing. Another person beaten-up, Abhishek Pandey, was also not associated with ABVP.

Barr did say he believed he was sticking up for the rule of law — and he said it immediately after the clip Todd presented was cut off.\n\n\"Meet the Press\" acknowledged the error in response to criticism from Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec on Twitter. NBC News declined to comment further, and Todd did not respond to a separate request for comment.\n\n\"Earlier today, we inadvertently and inaccurately cut short a video clip of an interview with AG Barr before offering commentary and analysis,\" the show said in a tweet. \"The remaining clip included important remarks from the attorney general that we missed, and we regret the error.\"\n\nThe discrepancy between Todd’s description of the clip he showed and Barr’s complete remarks drew backlash on Twitter from conservative pundits and politicians. President Donald Trump retweeted several criticisms and called more than once for the \"Meet the Press\" host to be fired, tagging the Federal Communications Commission and its chairman, Ajit Pai.\n\n\"Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd should be FIRED by \"Concast\" (NBC) for this fraud,\" Trump said in one tweet, using his pejorative nicknames for Todd and Comcast, NBC’s parent company. \"He knew exactly what he was doing.\"\n\nThe clip from Barr’s interview was shown as part of a question during a panel discussion about the Flynn case. Todd teed up his question for Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan after NBC News reporter Kristen Welker, another panelist, mentioned the attorney general.\n\n\"I want you to listen to this Bill Barr answer to a question about what will history say about this,\" Todd said. \"Wait until you hear this answer.

He didn't make the case that he was upholding the rule of law. He was almost admitting that, yeah, this is a political job.\"\n\nBut had the tape kept rolling, viewers would have seen that Barr did insist that he was upholding the rule of law. In fact, he used those exact words. Here’s his full quote, with the relevant portion in bold:\n\n\"Well, history is written by the winners. So it largely depends on who's writing the history.

However, no evidence supports claims of 'shepherding.'”\n⠀\n📷: _wilbur #WombatWednesday", "target": "Australian bushfires: animals that take refuge in wombat burrows usually uninvited, experts say\n\nPhotos of wombats have been shared hundreds of thousands of times in multiple Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit posts alongside a claim that the marsupials shepherd animals into their burrows in a bid to protect them from bushfires in Australia. The fires have killed as many as one billion animals in Australia since September 2019. The claim is misleading; experts say animals have long taken refuge in wombats’ burrows, but they are not invited by the marsupials.\n\nThis photo of a wombat in a man's arms has been liked more than 278,000 times on Twitter after being published on January 11, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post reads: “Apparently wombats in fire effected areas are not only allowing other animals to take shelter in their deep, fire-resistant burrows but are actively herding fleeing animals into them. We’re seeing more leadership and empathy from these guys than the entire Federal government.”\n\nAccording to the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage, “wombats are stout, sturdy marsupials native to Australia.”\n\nThere are three species of wombats, namely the bare-nosed, southern hairy-nosed and northern hairy-nosed wombats.\n\nDeadly bushfires have killed at least 28 people and an estimated one billion animals across Australia since September 2019, as reported here by AFP on January 15, 2020.\n\nSimilar claims about wombats were made here, here, here and here on Facebook, here, here, here and here on Twitter, here, here, here and here on Instagram, and here on Reddit.\n\nThe claims are misleading; experts say animals often take refuge in wombats’ burrows, but they usually come uninvited.\n\nUniversity of Adelaide ecologist Dr. Michael Swinbourne told AFP via email on January 16, 2020: “Wombats will share their burrows with other animals at the same time. I wouldn't say that wombats are \"happy\" about sharing with other animals, but they will \"tolerate\" them as long as they don't disturb the wombat too much.\n\n“Wombats generally don't like other wombats sharing their burrows, but they will under some circumstances. In general they will sometimes share with closely related wombats, but not with \"strangers\".\n\n“They also share with a wide range of other animals, such as reptiles, rodents, rabbits, echidnas, wallabies and even birds and koalas. We have images of penguins sheltering in a wombat burrow to escape the attention of a sea eagle.”\n\nBelow are four photographs provided by Dr. Swinbourne that show animals such as a) southern hairy-nosed wombat, b) little penguin, c) black-footed rock wallaby and d) sea eagle spotted near a wombat burrow:\n\nIn a research article titled “Interspecies co-use of southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) burrows”, which was published in the scientific journal Australian Mammalogy in 2016, scientists said, in part:\n\n“Burrow use was monitored using 34 motion-activated cameras placed outside wombat burrows between March and September 2015. Eleven species were found to use burrows, with six commensal species observed using burrows on numerous occasions. These included two mammal species (black-footed rock-wallaby, Petrogale lateralis pearsoni; brush-tailed bettong, Bettongia penicillata), three reptile species (peninsula dragon, Ctenophorus fionni; southern sand-skink, Liopholis multiscutata; White’s skink, Liopholis whitii), and one avian species (little penguin, Eudyptula minor).\n\n“The most common species observed using burrows was the black-footed rock-wallaby, which was recorded using burrows 1795 times.”\n\nA separate academic paper titled “Who utilises bare-nosed wombat burrows?\", which was published in the Australian Zoologist journal in 2018, states in part:\n\n“The species observed utilising wombat burrows included wombats, rabbits, macropods, possums, murids, foxes, cats and birds. The utilisation of wombat burrows by these species included entry into the burrow for shelter and hunting, and exploitation of the burrow entrance and spoil for foraging and potentially geophagic purposes.”\n\nAnimals such as koalas and rabbits have previously been seen in wombat burrows, including this April 2019 recording. The video was captured by camera traps laid by a group of science students from the University of Melbourne in the Australian state of Victoria.\n\nOther unexpected creatures, such as butterflies, have also been found fluttering in wombat burrows, as seen in this January 2020 video:\n\nThese animals, however, have not been invited in by wombats, experts say.\n\nDr. Swinbourne says: “Wombats definitely do not shepherd other animals into their burrows. It is possible that this idea arose because someone saw an animal either follow a wombat into its burrow, or the other animals went in first followed by the wombats.\n\n“Wombats generally are fairly tolerant of other animals. This may be because they have few real predators so they don't feel threatened by most animals, especially those that are small enough to fit in their burrows. They do interact with other animals on occasion.”\n\nWhen asked if wombats would actively invite other animals in their homes, Professor Michael Clarke, a professor of zoology at La Trobe University, provided a similar comment: “Very unlikely, given their solitary disposition.”\n\nNew South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage said despite their benevolence, wombats have set certain “ground rules” for their uninvited guests: “Although wombats will share burrows, they are possessive about their particular feeding grounds. They mark out these areas by leaving scent trails and droppings around the boundaries. If an intruding wombat moves in on their territory, it will be discouraged through a series of snorts, screeches and even a chase.”\n\nAlthough unintentional, the refuge wombats provide for other animals has proved crucial in protecting them against raging bushfires.\n\nThe “Interspecies co-use of southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) burrows” research paper states in part: “Burrows can provide refuge for both burrowing and non-burrowing species within harsh environments through protection from climatic extremes, water loss and predation.”\n\nThe University of Melbourne published this April 2019 report on a rare sighting of koalas and rabbits near a wombat burrow, which reads in part: “Burrows provide protection from the elements and predators -- they are a safe place for wombats to rest and provide a comfortable temperature.\n\n“Wombats use multiple burrows and spend about two thirds of their lives underground, which helps them conserve energy.\n\n“Wombat burrows can be more than just a hole in the ground. They are often complex, can contain more than one chamber, and are periodically ‘renovated’.\n\n“While wombats will use a number of different burrows, normally there will only be one occupant at any given time, as wombats are solitary creature.”\n\nDr. Swinbourne added: “Wombat burrows can provide protection from predators, from fires, or just from the weather. The daytime temperatures in inland Australia (the home of southern hairy-nosed wombats) can commonly reach up to 45C and there are few trees for shade, so getting out of the sun is important.\n\n“Wombat burrows can be very resistant to fire, but it would depend on the severity of the fire. Small fires would not worry a wombat in its burrow, but a really large fire like some of the ones on the east coast might cause problems.”\n\nWombat burrows are large enough to fit many animals - sometimes more than one of them - and even a grown man.\n\n“Wombat burrows can be quite deep and long. It depends on soil etc, but they can be up to 3m deep and 20m in length,” Dr. Swinbourne told AFP.\n\n“Burrows of the southern hairy-nosed wombat (there are three species of wombat) are usually grouped together into warrens, which can be huge -- as big as a football field and containing up to 50 burrows.”\n\nThis BBC video published in May 2008 illustrates how a wombat burrow can be wide and deep enough for the show host to climb into.\n\nWombats’ burrows may not be the only option for animals in need, but definitely the most accessible and practical one, according to Dr. Swinbourne.\n\n“There are a few other burrowing animals in Australia, but most of them are quite small (rodent size) so most other animals wouldn't fit inside. Animals like echindas also burrow, but their burrows are also small and wouldn't have room for other animals,” he said.\n\n“Unfortunately, the animals other than wombats that build the largest warrens - bettongs and bilbies - are almost extinct because of human persecution and introduced predators.”\n\nThe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia’s national science research agency, also issued a clarification about the misleading claim here on Facebook, here on Instagram and here on Twitter on January 15, 2020, saying wombats are “tolerating”, rather than “sharing” or inviting other animals in their burrows.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Curious if wombats are bushfire saviors? 🦡 Experts say animals find shelter in wombat burrows, but they're not exactly invited. 🤔\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you know?

The footage was handed over to the channel by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Delhi police. It was played as ‘authentic’ clip and used to claim that students entered the reading room with stones in their hands.\n\nA plethora of other news organisations carried the clip and claimed that the students had stones clasped in their hands.

For the purpose of this fact-check, Alt News used a higher resolution video received from sources in Jamia. The video is of the same footage played by India Today. Alt News slowed down the video and watched it frame-by-frame. We found that the student was holding a wallet in one of his hands, and a flat object (possibly a phone) in the other.\n\nHere is the sequence of events – the student enters the room with a wallet in his right hand and a linear object (possibly a phone) in his left hand. At about 10 seconds, he goes out of the frame and comes back at 17 seconds when his right hand is empty. The brown wallet is now visible in his left hand.\n\nThe wallet is visible in multiple frames, however, is most clear at the 1:22-minute mark when the student stretches out his arm.\n\nAnother clear shot of the wallet can be seen at 2:27. If one notices carefully, the two brown flaps of the wallet are distinctly noticeable and the gap in between is darker – a shade of black.\n\nThe student holds a flat object in his other hand which could possibly be a mobile phone. It isn’t as distinctly noticeable as the wallet and users are advised to watch the complete video in loops to self-analyse.

{"query_id": 1.2429685302508708e+18, "query": "OK, buckle up. I wanna talk to you about Triscuit.", "target": "On March 25, 2020, Twitter user Sage Boggs posted a thread that seemingly revealed a shocking (literally) fact: The Triscuit got its name in the early 1900s because it was one of the first foods to be baked with electricity.\n\nThe entire thread is worth a read (you can view it here). We’ve included screenshots of the most relevant tweets below:\n\nFactually speaking, we didn’t find much to quibble with in Boggs’ thread.\n\nTriscuit crackers were developed in the early 1900s, and early advertisements did tout the “wheat biscuits” as being “baked by electricity.” For example, this ad was published in The Montgomery Advertiser in September 1903:\n\nAt first, however, we weren’t entirely convinced that this electric baking method served as the inspiration for the Triscuit name. In fact, Boggs’ thread left us with more questions than answers. Wouldn’t the letters “ele” better signify this product’s relationship to electricity? Why not “Elescuits”? And aren’t Triscuit snacks marketed today as crackers, not biscuits? Why not “Tricker”? Does “tri” really not refer to “three”? Not thrice-baked, not three ingredients, not three of anything?\n\nAnd what exactly does “baked by electricity” mean? In short, we just don’t trust these crackers.\n\nWe went digging in the archives to learn more about the origins of Triscuit. Our working theory was based on the etymology of the word “biscuit,” which was derived from the medieval Latin word “biscoctum,” meaning “twice-baked.” The quiz show Jeopardy used this logic for a clue during a 2018 episode, positing: “The name of this cracker that’s been around since 1903 suggests that it was baked 3 times.”\n\nHowever, we were unable to find any advertisements or company materials describing the Triscuit as a thrice-baked cracker.\n\nIn fact, what we did find about the Triscuit cooking process supported the idea that it was truly an electric biscuit. The story of the Triscuit starts in the late 1800s when a man named Henry D. Perky developed a machine to produce little square biscuits made of shredded wheat. (You can see one of Perky’s early patents from 1900 here).\n\nPerky’s inventions not only produced a tasty treat, they were also a major development in food manufacturing. A 1904 article in Western Electrician described how Triscuit crackers were baked, and praised the Natural Food Company for making “the largest development of electric cooking in the world” that had been “successful in every way.”\n\nIn the winter of 1902-3, about a year and a half ago, the Natural Food Company of Niagara Falls, N.Y., began the manufacture of a new product they call Triscuit, it being a cracker of shredded wheat baked or toasted by having heat applied to both sides at the same time. The operation consists of passing the product through a machine between two endless link belts enclosed except at one end. The links of the belts are electric stoves, and are so arranged that the Triscuit is fed in and held pressed between the faces of the two stoves throughout the complete circuit of the machine. The operation is continuous. Each machine has about 2,500 stoves and has a product of 17,500 triscuits an hour. They are operating about 10,000 of these stoves, and their failures up to date have been less than one per cent from all causes. This is the largest development of electric cooking in the world, and is successful in every way; the cost for baking, including labor, being less for the same amount of product of triscuits than for shredded whit biscuit using coal.\n\nWhen we first came across the “electric biscuit” advertisement in Boggs’ thread above, it seemed to be more of a clever advertising gimmick then a core aspect of a Triscuit. However, as noted in the article in Western Electrician, the electric baking process of a Triscuit was a major development in the food production world.\n\nA cookbook of shredded wheat recipes presented by the Shredded Wheat Company in 1911 also noted that the Triscuit cooking process had “attracted the attention of electricians from all over the world”:\n\nThe following advertisement from a 1903 issue of American Motherhood called the Triscuit “the highest achievement known to the science of food production.”\n\nAnother pair of early advertisements from 1903 emphasized the “electric” aspect of this shredded wheat snack:\n\nWhile we were busy combing through information from the 1900s, the answer to this pressing question popped up in a more modern medium: The official Twitter account for Triscuit caught wind of Boggs’ thread and updated the company’s profile to include lightning bolts and the text: “elecTRIcity biSCUIT… but you can just call us Triscuit #ifykyk.” (If you know, you know.)\n\nTriscuit also posted a message in response to Bogg’s thread, reading: “We had to go all the way up the ladder but we CAN confirm.”\n\nThere you have it. Triscuit crackers were named not because they contain three ingredients, or comprise three layers, or because they were baked three times, but because they were baked by electricity.\n\nOur search into the origins of the Triscuit came with quite a few surprises, but the most shocking (pun intended) to us cracker-eaters was how Triscuit was advertised as something of miracle food. It was good for children, made purely of “God’s creation” (wheat), and could be eaten at any time of day, according to promotional materials. We also found several cookbooks featuring Triscuit recipes, and while many sounded appealing, such as Triscuit with cheese, butter, or jam, we must direct your attention to the “King’s Menu” from volume 16 of the 1903 book The King and His Navy and Army.\n\nThe King’s Menu included three Triscuit dishes: Triscuit Croutons, Cream Fruit Triscuit, and Pigeons on Triscuit Toast:", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Shocking revelation!

{"query_id": 1.2051580102235505e+18, "query": " _HillierMP I downloaded the full resolution original from her tweet.", "target": "In December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed that Diane Abbott, a prominent Labour MP in the U.K. and the party’s spokesperson on Home Affairs, had posed for photographs on the day of the U.K. general election, wearing two odd shoes, one of which appeared to have been on the wrong foot.\n\nOn Dec. 12, while voting was underway, the Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, Metro UK, and Daily Express published reports including photographs that showed Abbott wearing mismatched shoes — that is, the shoe on her left foot came from a different pair than the shoe on her right foot. Those articles also claimed that Abbott wore a left-foot shoe on her right foot. The Telegraph wrote that:\n\n“Diane Abbott went viral on social media today after she was spotted wearing two left shoes from different pairs while canvassing voters. The shadow home secretary was pictured with Meg Hillier, the Labour candidate for Hackney South and Shoreditch, encouraging constituents to support Labour in a now-deleted tweet. The photo quickly went viral online when users spotted Ms Abbott was wearing two black left shoes from different pairs.”\n\nBased on several photographs posted by different Twitter users including Abbott herself, it’s clear that on Dec. 12, Abbott at several times wore mismatched shoes. Though she also appears to have worn two left shoes, we can’t verify that particular claim definitively.\n\nIn the 24 hours leading up to the 2019 general election on Dec. 12, Abbott canvassed in several London constituencies on behalf of party colleagues standing for election. (In her own constituency of Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Abbott ended up re-elected with a massive majority, winning more than 70 percent of votes, though the Labour Party as a whole lost seats and the Conservative government greatly expanded its parliamentary majority).\n\nAt 8:32 a.m., Abbott posted to Twitter a photograph of herself standing with Labour activists outside Dalston Junction train station in the London borough of Hackney:\n\nShe wore mismatched shoes in that photograph, and the curve of the shoe on her right foot suggests it was a left-foot shoe, as this magnified version of the photograph shows. However, that curve might simply be a result of Abbott’s stance.\n\nAt 9:06 a.m., a Twitter user posted two photographs taken outside Dalston Kingsland train station, again in the borough of Hackney. In one of them, Abbott posed alongside the user, a young boy, and Meg Hillier, Labour candidate for the adjoining constituency of Hackney South and Shoreditch (standing to Abbott’s left in the photograph):\n\nIn that photograph, Abbott again wore mismatched shoes. The curve on the right shoe suggests it was intended to be worn on her left foot, but again, we can’t definitively verify that based only on the photograph.\n\nAt some point in the morning, likely at the same time Abbott and Hillier were photographed together, Hillier herself posted a photograph to Twitter, which showed just herself and Abbott standing together, again outside Dalston Kingsland train station. The tweet was later deleted, but several Twitter users took screenshots of it:\n\nAgain, a magnified version of the photograph clearly shows that Abbott was wearing mismatched shoes. Although not definitive, the shoe on her right foot again appears to be intended for a left foot.\n\nSome Twitter users argued that the picture posted by Hillier was later altered, and that other photographs taken on Election Day showed that Abbott was, in fact, wearing properly matched shoes. Those arguments were fatally flawed.\n\nIt’s possible that Hillier’s photograph originally showed Abbott wearing two shoes from the same pair, and that image was later edited by third parties, after Hillier’s tweet was deleted, but this makes no sense. Those doing the editing would merely have been digitally altering Abbott’s right foot in order to make it look exactly as it did in two other photographs — one posted by a supporter of Abbott’s, and the other posted by Abbott herself.\n\nAnyone suggesting that all photographs showing Abbott with mismatched shoes were manipulated would, by necessity, have to support a hypothesis in which Abbott herself took the time on Election Day morning to — for some reason that defies explanation — arrange for her own photograph of herself, taken at Dalston Junction, to be digitally edited so as to falsely appear as if she were wearing mismatched shoes, and then upload that digitally edited version to Twitter via her Android cellphone at 8:32 a.m.\n\nThe claim that other photographs taken on Dec. 12 show Abbott with properly matched shoes was inaccurate. One user replied to multiple tweets about Abbott’s shoes, accusing various others of being “sheep” and of “contributing to fake news” and displaying “ignorance.” In support of those charges, the user pointed to another photograph of Abbott that showed her wearing properly matched shoes, claiming “here is what she is actually wearing”:\n\nHowever, that particular photograph could not have been taken on Dec. 12, because Abbott posted it to Twitter on the afternoon of Dec. 11, when it was likely to have been taken:\n\nThat Twitter user’s claims were therefore inaccurate.\n\nYet another Twitter user posted another photograph of Abbott wearing properly matched shoes, writing: “Looks like Diane Abbott’s shoes are matching here from earlier today…”\n\nIt’s understandable that that user and others thought the photograph was taken on Election Day, because Abbott posted it to Twitter at 9 a.m. that morning, along with several others. It shows her canvassing with Marsha de Cordova, Labour’s candidate in the southwest London constituency of Battersea:\n\nHowever, the photograph in question was actually taken on the previous day, Dec. 11. Although not the same photograph, Abbott tweeted out an almost identical one at 6:47 p.m. the night before — showing the exact same group of individuals, standing in the exact same positions:\n\nClearly, the photograph Abbott posted at 9 a.m. on Election Day came from the previous evening’s canvass in Battersea, as this side-by-side comparison shows:\n\nIt’s unclear why or how Abbott came to wear odd shoes on Election Day. One of the shoes might have been required for therapeutic purposes or to aid recovery from an injury, or the mismatch might have been caused by absent-mindedness or the result of an Election Day rush to go canvassing. We invited the Labour Party to provide any relevant information or context, or an explanation for Abbott’s attire in the photographs, but we received no response.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: HillierMP I got the high-res version from her tweet and it definitely shows mismatched shoes!\nRewritten Tweet 2: Breaking!

But I was very disappointed to see this RANDOM stack of bricks in front of the courthouse. #setup #BlackLivesMatters #makeblackcount", "target": "Government officials, law enforcement, billionaires, or antifa groups nefariously placed pallets of bricks at protest sites in U.S. cities to stoke violence during June 2020 demonstrations against police brutality.\n\nIt is possible that protesters themselves could have strategically placed bricks in easily accessible spots to facilitate causing property damage, though no evidence proved that was indeed occurring.\n\nNo evidence suggests a coordinated effort existed on behalf of government entities or billionaires to place bricks on protest routes to incite violence during the demonstrations. Also, evidence showed that in many cases \"suspicious\" bricks depicted on social media were on streets for ongoing construction projects, not \"planted\" for protesters.\n\nProtesters in many major U.S. cities used bricks to cause destruction — or, in some cases, to injure police — while walking on streets during the 2020 demonstrations.\n\nAs American cities erupted in protests against racism and police brutality following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020, social media users began spreading posts alleging that some group — or person — with nefarious intentions had coordinated a scheme to incite and abet violence during the demonstrations by pre-placing piles of bricks along protest routes.\n\nThe claim could be summarized like this: Government officials, law enforcement, billionaires, or protesters themselves had strategically placed caches of cinder blocks in cities nationwide — including Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, and New York City — so protesters could quickly grab the bricks and break windows or cause other property damage. Among the most popular posts was a video of someone who recorded a pile of bricks purportedly near a Dallas courthouse and called the pallets a “setup” while another person claimed, “they put them there on purpose, bro.'”\n\nIt is unequivocally true that protesters in many major U.S. cities used bricks to cause destruction (or, in some cases, to injure police) during the protests against police brutality following the death of George Floyd — a 46-year-old, unarmed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.\n\nBut less is known about where, or from whom, the protesters got the bricks, and if the rumors on social media alleging a coordinated scheme on behalf of government, activists, or a powerful figure had any truth.\n\nWhat follows is a multi-prong examination into the claim. First, we describe the different groups behind the assertion, and then we investigate this specific theory: that the government, police, or another powerful entity formed a scheme to pre-place the bricks along protest routes so officers could retaliate against people who used them or to incite destruction. Lastly, we examine the possibility that the bricks were strategically placed on streets by protesters themselves.\n\nWho Is Making the Claim?\n\nAn array of people claimed pallets of bricks appeared in protest hot spots as some nefarious scheme, essentially forming three distinct groups that blamed different entities or people for the alleged conspiracy.\n\nFirst, some people said police officers or government authorities pre-placed the stacks of bricks to create what protesters called a “trap” set up by officers to quickly catch anyone who used them and have a reason to use excessive force. Many believers of that theory used the hashtag #baitbricks on social media to spread awareness of the alleged government-run scheme and circulated the below-displayed poster as a safety message for protesters:\n\nOther people were less specific with where, or on whom, they were placing blame for the alleged conspiracy to undermine Americans during the protests, and the perpetrators’ rationale.\n\nThey included followers of the QAnon movement and accounts that suggested without any proof that billionaire investor Warren Buffet, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, or financier George Soros owned the bricks and created a master plan to instigate violence. For instance, the Twitter account of an anti-vaccine advocate claimed in a June 2 video that went viral:\n\nWhile the videographer did accurately state that Berkshire Hathaway owns the brick manufacturer, that Gates stepped down from Hathaway’s board in March 2020, and that Hathaway owns the industrial holding company Marmon Group in Chicago that Jay Pritzker and Robert Pritzker founded, no evidence suggests any truth behind the video’s underlying claim: that Acme Brick Company, the nation’s largest brick maker, was indeed coordinating brick drop-offs for protesters.\n\nThat brings us to our next point: Some accounts believed antifa (short for anti-fascist) activists — who include a variety of leftist groups that fight white supremacy and neo-Nazis — distributed the bricks on streets where they knew they would be protesting for easy access in the heat of the moment. Among that group of skeptics was a Twitter account with more than 145,000 followers to promote “Felccas Talks” — a pro-U.S. President Donald Trump media campaign — which tweeted the following, aiming to raise suspicion among his fans that bricks seemed too convenient for protesters to simply discover:\n\nBy June 1, the Daily Mail, FOXNews, and Breitbart had published stories on the phenomenon, articles that essentially recirculated the claims from social media users without attempting to examine from where the bricks originated.\n\nHad Pallets of Bricks Appeared at Protest Sites?\n\nConsidering the variety and amount of video and photographic evidence that shows bricks in areas where protesters were planning to gather, or already had, we can conclusively state: Yes, pallets of bricks were indeed along protest routes in multiple U.S. cities in late May and early June 2020.\n\nBut how they got there, in many cases, was less exciting than what conspiracists claimed. Per video footage, Google Maps, and other evidence, stockpiles of bricks in several cities with protests had been placed on streets long before the demonstrations following Floyd’s death began, as part of a construction project in the area, or else the bricks had a destination that wasn’t a protest site.\n\nIn regards to that latter point, a video that was viewed more than 3.2 million times in just days (even after the user who apparently captured the footage deleted it) showed police officers in Boston preparing bricks in the bed of a pickup to allegedly drop off at protest sites, according to claims online. One Instagram caption to the footage read:\n\nBut according to police authorities, viewers misinterpreted what police were doing with the bricks and where they were taking them.\n\nPer the Northeastern University Police Department (NUPD), which provides security and law enforcement for the Boston campus, the officers in the video are part of the campus force and were on a routine patrol on June 1 when they discovered a damaged brick sidewalk on a popular corridor. To prevent pedestrians from injuring themselves, the officers said they picked up the bricks, returned them to NUPD headquarters (shown in the video), and notified the city’s police force about the sidewalk damage. The agency said on Twitter:\n\nAlong the same lines of what appeared to be viral misinterpretations, the below-displayed photos made the rounds on social media, apparently referencing locations in Dallas.\n\nBut by studying Google Map footage and other evidence related to the claim, a team of NBC journalists determined the photographs actually documented vehicles removing bricks — not leaving them on streets like the claim asserted — and the bricks had been in that location since February 2020, months before Floyd’s death.\n\nA similar misunderstanding seemed to have transpired over a video titled “Los Angeles Resident Finds Stash of Rocks by Bus Stop … Antifa Terrorism” that shows crates of bricks along Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, California, and includes audio of the videographer saying:\n\nHowever, a Jewish community center on the street, Chabad of Sherman Oaks, said that claim was false, and that the center was responsible for installing the crates months before the protests began as a security precaution to protect the building. A Facebook post by the synagogue said:\n\nSome Reports Appeared to Be Related to Construction, Not to the Demonstrations\n\nIn New York City, the claim surfaced via the below-displayed tweet, which includes a video that’s been viewed more than 3.7 million times and depicts protesters in Manhattan removing barricades surrounding a stack of bricks and then taking from the stockpile. The video stops before viewers see what they do with the cinder blocks, but people can be heard celebrating them.\n\nBut according to our examination of the footage, construction scaffolding is nearby, suggesting that the bricks were part of an on-going construction project rather than some organized scheme. Also, a Google Map image from June 2019 confirms the presence of scaffolding and that the site is under construction.\n\nSimilarly, in Frisco, Texas, where tweets claimed multiple pallets of bricks had been “planted” near where protests were scheduled, construction crews were seen covering the bricks with tarps as an effort to keep them to complete a purported highway project — not some strategic plan to instigate protesters.\n\nIn response to another report in that city, the Frisco Police Department said a pile was part of a housing construction project near protesters’ scheduled route, and police removed those stacks from the area to avoid any temptation by protesters. Frisco police Sgt. Evan Mattei told The Associated Press:\n\n“At this point, our department has no intelligence to suggest that any bricks have been placed on this specific route in advance of this protest for violent purposes.”\n\nOn that same point, the San Francisco Police Department said pallets of bricks that social media users believed to be “an attempt to escalate our protest” were part of a construction project, and the department asked the contractor to remove them from the street.\n\nA similar story played out in Fort Myers, Florida, where city officials told the local NBC news station the bricks in question were part of a project to install optic fiber in the area. “The bricks have been here for a long time,” said a resident, who works in the downtown area.\n\nMeanwhile, in Fayetteville, North Carolina, someone recorded a video in which viewers can see protesters and what the narrator called “some random-ass bricks” near them. But those stacks, too, had apparently been in the area before demonstrations began and were part of a project to improve the walkway for pedestrians.\n\nA video that was uploaded to YouTube on May 24 (the day before Floyd’s death) about the city’s reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic confirmed this theory (it shows the bricks), as well as a 2018 document called “Fayetteville comprehensive pedestrian plan” that listed the site as one in need of crosswalk and signal improvements. Additionally, BBC misinformation specialists confirmed with the city of Fayetteville that construction crews had placed the bricks on the sidewalk recently for restoration work.\n\nMight Protesters Have Purposefully Placed Stockpiles of Bricks on Streets?\n\nThose misunderstandings aside, at least two government-run departments — the Kansas City Police and Houston Public Works — said they had received and investigated reports of “bricks and rocks” during the demonstrations.\n\nThe former agency — without providing photographic evidence or further details — suggested the “stashes” were purposefully placed “to be used during a riot,” essentially suggesting an effort by someone or a group to cause property destruction with the cinder blocks.\n\nFurthermore, in reference to the claims that protesters, perhaps those who consider themselves anti-fascists, had pre-placed the bricks, it is important to note that not all activists who resist fascism use weapons or cause property destruction during protests. However, some antifa members believe any violence that does occur during protests is a form of self-defense to combat extreme right-wing ideologies.\n\n“Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,” which historian Mark Bray published in 2017 and explores the movement since the 1920s, includes several instances during protests in which followers of the leftist ideas hurled bricks or had the cinder blocks thrown at them. One group in a newsletter described its activism strategy as:\n\nIn sum, since no evidence suggests there was a coordinated effort on behalf of government entities or billionaires to pre-place bricks on protest routes to incite violence during the 2020 demonstrations against police brutality, and considering the amount and variety of proof that showed many of the reports of suspicious bricks on social media were misunderstandings, we rate this claim “Mostly False” — with the caveat that it is possible that antifa members or other protesters could have strategically placed bricks in easily accessible spots to facilitate causing property damage.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Despite all the chaos, it was quite disheartening to find a random stack of bricks just sitting outside the courthouse in Dallas. #setup #BlackLivesMatters #makeblackcount\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Can you believe it?

Gillespie, who is hoping to unseat Democratic incumbent Mark Warner this fall, was interviewed by WCYB-TV.\n\n\"These new regulations on carbon emissions will kill, according to the Chamber of Commerce, 244,000 jobs a year, every year, for the next 15 years and will cost the average family of four $1,200 a year on higher energy costs,\" he .\n\nGillespie was referring to a that was released May 28 and became the basis for much of the GOP criticism of Obama’s carbon-reduction plan.\n\nThe national goal of the regulations is to cut carbon emission from existing power plants by 30 percent by 2030 -- compared to 2005 levels. This is to be achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional \"cap and trade\" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many coal plants.\n\nBut the chamber study that Gillespie and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030. That’s a significant difference when it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, a point that the chamber acknowledges.\n\n\"We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward,\" Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, . \"Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study).\"\n\nWhy can’t the numbers simply be converted?\n\nIn assuming Obama would set a higher goal, the chamber also postulated that the Environmental Protection Agency would be forced to change other policies to meet the 42 percent threshold. The goal would be attainable, the chamber concluded, only if the EPA by 2022 required new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology. The actual proposal, however, does not require plants to have such capabilities.\n\nThis is important because, as the chamber report noted, plants with carbon capture technology are far more expensive to build and operate than traditional ones.Therefore, the chamber’s conclusion that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown.\n\nThe chamber report said power companies would significantly increase their electricity rates to recoup the costs of building new plants with carbon capture technology. Businesses would recoup their increased energy expenses, the report said, by paring jobs.\n\nThe EPA was highly critical of the chamber’s report and on the day of its release, that the study was \"irresponsible speculation based on guesses of what our draft proposal will be.\"\n\nIt noted that the chamber failed to consider significant health and climate savings that would come from lowering carbon emissions. And the EPA tipped its hand, five days prior to Gillespie’s TV interview, by announcing its soon-to-be-revealed regulations would not require carbon capture.\n\nWe also should note that Gillespie, in his TV interview, overstated two figures in the flawed report:\n• He said an average family would spend $1,200 a year more on electricity; the actual figure was about $200. We asked Gillespie’s campaign for an explanation and spokesman Paul Logan said the $1,200 figure actually came from an analysis by the , a conservative research group. Heritage’s , released in March, incorrectly assumed that the EPA would phase out all coal-fired energy plants.\n• Gillespie said the chamber predicted an annual loss of 244,000 jobs; the actual number was 224,000.\n\nIn addition to his TV interview, Gillespie posted a that applied estimates in the chamber report to the administration’s proposal.\n\nPaul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, defended his boss’s comments by saying the chamber study \"looked at a similar regulatory scheme\" to what Obama proposed.\n\nAs we noted, Gillespie was hardly the only Republican who used chamber statistics to denounce the White House proposal. Similar comments were made by U.S. Rep. , R-4th; , chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia; and House Speaker , R-Ohio. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is using the statistics in a against incumbent Warner, whom Gillespie is challenging.\n\nGillespie, during a visit to coal country, said new EPA \"regulations on carbon emissions will kill, according to the Chamber of Commerce, 244,000 jobs a year, every year, for the next 15 years and will cost the average family of four $1,200 a year on higher energy costs.\"\n\nGillespie refers to a May 28 chamber study that wrongly assumed the White House would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030 -- a standard that the report said could only met by requiring the construction of natural gas plants with expensive carbon capture capabilities. The regulations, released June 2, actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber says its estimates do not apply to the goals as announced.\n\nThere was opportunity for Gillespie to realize the chamber’s assumptions were unreliable. Five days before his comments, the EPA announced that carbon capture would not be part of its upcoming proposals. Gillespie not only continued to use numbers from the report, he overstated some of them.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: New EPA regulations could result in an estimated 59,700 job losses annually in the South Atlantic region through 2030! \n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Some experts suggest that proposed EPA rules might lead to around 59,700 jobs lost each year in the South Atlantic region by 2030. \n\nRewritten Tweet 3: Unbelievable! 😱 Proposed EPA changes might mean up to 59,700 fewer jobs every year in the South Atlantic until 2030!\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: Did you know that the South Atlantic region is expected to lose approximately 59,700 jobs annually due to the new EPA regulations?\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: It's reported that the South Atlantic could see a yearly loss of 59,700 jobs due to the new EPA rules from now till 2030."}

However, this was misleading as we will find during the course of this article.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nOn August 23, The Times of India(TOI) published an article titled, “Cut cakes, end slaughter, says RSS arm, sparks row”. The report said that “the RSS-affiliate Muslim Rashtriya Manch on Wednesday (August 22) asked its members to cut cakes with goat caricatures to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha.” According to the report, the Manch has 13 lakh members.\n\nTOI also included an image of a few members of the Rashtriya Muslim Manch cutting a cake that looked similar to the ones shared by ANI and News18. The man in the picture looked similar as well, however, this could not be conclusively said as the photograph used by TOI was not very clear.\n\nThe Times of India quoted the Vice President of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, Raees Raja, who said that the practice of not sacrificing goats has been followed by the organisation since its inception in 2002.\n\nAlt News contacted Raja who confirmed to us that the Manch is affiliated to RSS, of which he is also a part. He added that it is run under the guidance of RSS leader Indresh Kumar.\n\nWhen asked if the images used by ANI and The Times of India pertained to the same Bakrid celebrations, Raja affirmed.

No, that's not true: There is no known cure for the virus that to date has infected more than 24,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe story appears to have originated with a press release from the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service that was picked up and published by Health Impact News on January 27, 2020, under the title \"Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus.\" The article (archived here) began:\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed, or stopped, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C. Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular. It is very important to maximize the body's anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness. But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThere is \"no conclusive evidence\" that taking large doses of Vitamin C will protect someone from the virus, Dr. Anthony Fehr, whose research includes work on coronavirus pathogens at the University of Kansas, told Lead Stories.\n\n\"I don't know of any dangers to taking large amounts of Vitamin C, just that it might give people a false sense of hope that they are protected,\" he said.\n\nAdditionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO say there is no specific \"antiviral treatment\" recommended for this virus, formally known as 2019-n-CoV.\n\n\"People infected with 2019-nCoV should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms,\" the CDC said in a statement posted on its website. \"For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.\"\n\nThe WHO is warning against misinformation regarding the prevention and treatment of the virus, including claims that taking large doses of vitamin C, drinking sesame oil or eating garlic will either prevent or slow the spread of it. The WHO has taken to social media with a #knowyourfacts campaign to combat such claims.\n\nWhile taking Vitamin C supplements is potentially helpful for a person's health, CDC spokesman Scott Pauley told Lead Stories the agency \"recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses.\" It includes the following:\n• Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n• Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol, if soap and water are not available.\n• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n• Avoid close contact with people who are sick.\n• Stay home when you are sick.\n• Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes healthimpactnews.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.

Also contrary to the posts, cloth and surgical masks are not entirely ineffective because they prevent the wearer from transmitting infection to others through droplets. Surgical masks also protect wearers from getting potential infections via droplets. In addition, people who wear these masks are in little to no danger of breathing in too much carbon dioxide.\n\nN95 respirators with valves do allow unfiltered exhaled air to reach others, increasing the risk of spreading infection. Cloth and surgical masks do not protect the wearer from airborne infection. Cloth masks also get dirty easily, which is why OSHA and CDC recommend regular washing.\n\nAnother day, another viral claim about the effectiveness (or not) of face masks amid the coronavirus pandemic of 2020.\n\nA popular Facebook post that had been copied and pasted numerous times in June repeated spurious but familiar claims about masks, this time selectively citing U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) recommendations:\n\nIn July 2020, a similar post — this time attributed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — made almost identical claims about N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks. This photo circulated online:\n\nThe lengthy posts focused on three different types of protective masks: N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks. We tackle assertions about each one below.\n\nAccording to the posts your unfiltered, potentially infectious breath could harm others if you are breathing through an N95 respirator.\n\nN95 masks: are designed for CONTAMINATED environments. That means when you exhale through N95 the design is that you are exhaling into contamination. The exhale from N95 masks are vented to breath straight out without filtration. They don’t filter the air on the way out. They don’t need to. Conclusion: if you’re in Stewart’s and the guy with Covid has N95 mask his covid breath is unfiltered being exhaled into Stewart’s (because it was designed for already contaminated environments, it’s not filtering your air on the way out)\n\nThis is mostly true, except it only applies to N95 respirators with valves. Such masks were designed for construction/factory workers or miners, to keep out dust and other particles, but not to prevent infectious particles from leaving the mask. When the wearer inhales, the one-way valve closes so pathogens can’t get through, but when the user exhales, the valve opens. In May, the San Francisco Department of Public Health tweeted that N95 masks with valves in the front weren’t safe and “may actually propel your germs further.”\n\nHospitals largely use N95 masks without valves for this reason, and in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. OSHA’s guidelines on N95s primarily focus on how they are meant “to prevent workers from inhaling small particles, including airborne transmissible or aerosolized infectious agents,” and should be required in workplaces where respirators are needed.\n\nThe Facebook post argues that wearing a surgical mask makes you a “walking virus dispenser,” as follows:\n\nSurgical Mask: these masks were designed and approved for STERILE environments. The amount of particles and contaminants in the outside and indoor environments where people are CLOGG these masks very Very quickly. The moisture from your breath combined with the clogged mask will render it “useless” IF you come in contact with Covid and your mask traps it You become a walking virus dispenser. Everytime you put your mask on you are breathing the germs from EVERYWHERE you went. They should be changed or thrown out every “20-30 minutes in a non sterile environment”\n\nOSHA guidelines seem to contradict some of these claims, arguing that surgical masks protect workers “against [potentially infectious] splashes and sprays,” and also “contain” the wearer’s respiratory droplets to protect others. OSHA says these masks should be placed on sick individuals to prevent transmission via droplets. Surgical masks do, however, offer ineffective protection from transmission via airborne particles due to their loose fit. While the post argues that such masks should be thrown out every 20-30 minutes, OSHA simply recommends that they “should be properly disposed of after use.”\n\nThe Facebook post’s and letter’s claims about cloth masks are mostly false and have been debunked by Snopes before. The author claims:\n\nCloth masks: today three people pointed to their masks as the walked by me entering Lowe’s. They said “ya gotta wear your mask BRO” I said very clearly “those masks don’t work bro, in fact they MAKE you sicker” the “pshh’d” me. By now hopefully you all know CLOTH masks do not filter anything … ALL of them offer NO FILTERING whatsoever. As you exhale you are ridding your lungs of contaminants and carbon dioxide. Cloth masks trap this carbon dioxide the best. It actually risks health. The moisture caught in these masks can become mildew ridden over night. Dry coughing, enhanced allergies, sore throat are all symptoms of a micro-mold in your mask.\n\nOSHA guidelines already state that cloth masks are ineffective filters against airborne particles. They are worn to protect other people from risk of infection via respiratory droplets. People wearing them are in little to no danger of breathing in unhealthy amounts of carbon dioxide. The posts point out the danger of dirty masks, which is why both OSHA and CDC recommend washing cloth masks after use.\n\nOSHA also “generally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work,” contradicting the argument of this entire post.\n\nFinally, the author of the Facebook post claimed to be “OSHA 10&30 certified,” which refers to OSHA’s 10-hour and 30-hour training modules about common health and safety hazards in the workplace. We reached out to OSHA, and a representative told us that these courses “do not include COVID-19 topics,” nor does OSHA “certify” trainers.\n\nSnopes also reached out to the CDC about the photograph of the notice. They directed us to their guidance on cloth masks, and issued the following statement:\n\nIn sum, the varied claims in these viral posts (with their dubious origins) for the most part misrepresented information provided by OSHA and the CDC. Scientific wisdom argues that wearing a mask is more effective than doing nothing, and, combined with social distancing and other safety measures, offers protection not only to the wearer but to others. Given these posts’ combination of only a few correct facts and largely incorrect conclusions, we rate their various claims as “Mostly False.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Did you know?

One is about a pay calculator the BMA released last summer, which according to the government is the source of suggestions that some doctors would get a 30% pay cut. The other is about whether it was fair back then to say the government intended to cut pay at all.\n\nAlthough pay for evenings and Saturdays has been described as the ‘substantive’ area of dispute between the BMA and the government at this stage, there’s also been significant disagreement over the contract’s effects on working hours.\n\nThe BMA’s pay calculator got it wrong on recommended pay, according to the government\n\nThe Department of Health told us the best example of misleading information on pay was the ‘ready reckoner’ pay calculator released by the BMA over the summer.\n\nAt the time NHS Employers, the body behind the pay recommendations the calculator was based on, said it was one of a few that had issues:\n\n“Most calculators that we have seen are underestimating what junior doctor earnings would be, either through errors, or because they are not including all aspects of pay.”\n\n“For example, most do not include the on call availability supplement… which could be a significant amount, or include any flexible pay premia, which could further boost some junior doctors earnings. It is inevitable that pay calculators will show a trend towards reduction in pay if they compare 100 per cent of current earnings against less than 100 per cent of new earnings.”\n\nWe don’t know exactly which of these problems applied to the BMA’s calculator specifically, or the 30% figure. The full statement doesn’t seem to be available online any more so we’ve asked NHS Employers for a copy of it.\n\nThe calculator was later taken down by the BMA. We’ve asked it for a response to the government’s allegation that the calculator was inaccurate, and that doctors were misled on their pay as a result. We haven’t had a response at the time of writing.\n\nPutting the specific 30% figure to one side, whether the BMA was right to say that some level of pay cut was coming down the line depends on divining the government’s intentions.\n\nIn July the body tasked with reviewing proposed contracts recommended that ‘scenarios’ in which pay would fall for some doctors be used “as the basis for further discussion/negotiation between the parties”.\n\nIn August, the BMA said it wouldn’t negotiate on the recommendations because they represented a worse offer for doctors than when it had walked away from talks the previous October.\n\nThe government had already said that if the BMA wasn’t prepared to negotiate, it was ready to impose a contract.\n\nThe question is whether this meant it was determined to impose the recommendations more or less intact, which would entail a pay cut for some doctors, or whether at this point it was prepared to change the parts of the contract to protect pay.\n\nThe government says that the option of pay protection was always on the table.\n\nWhen he first announced the contract would contain pay protection in October, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said:\n\n“I made it clear to the BMA at the beginning of September that that was a possible outcome of negotiations, in an attempt to encourage it to return to the negotiating table. Rather than negotiating, it chose to wind up its own members and create a huge amount of unnecessary anger.”\n\nThe BMA felt differently about where the pay protection proposal had come from, saying “it has taken the threat of industrial action and the sight of thousands of junior doctors taking to the streets to reach this point.”\n\nPay protection eventually appeared in a formal contract proposal made by NHS Employers at the start of November.

Similarly, BJP member and former Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das (archive link) quote-tweeted ANI’s video and alleged the same.\n\nSimilarly, several users posted the viral image on Twitter.\n\nShankaracharya Temple is lit every year on Maha Shivratri\n\nAlt News spoke with Dr Karan Singh, chairman of the Dharmarth Trust. This trust manages all the major Hindu shrines in Jammu and Kashmir. Singh said, “The Shankaracharya Temple has invariably been lit up for Maha Shivratri and not a single year has ever been missed. Perhaps this year the illumination received special attention from the media due to the restructuring of the J&K State.”\n\nKaran Singh’s son, Vikramaditya, also a former member of J&K legislative council, quote-tweeted Mishra and said, “A disclaimer for all: J&K Dharmarth Trust has been celebrating Maha Shivratri for several decades at Shankaracharya Mandir, Srinagar. The lighting & decorations are done by the Trust every year and all claims of 30 years of darkness at this historic Temple are False.”\n\nAlt News spoke with Srinagar-based Sanjay Tickoo, president of the Kashmiri Pandit Sangarash Samiti (KPSS). According to him, this was neither the first time Maha Shivratri was celebrated in decades nor was it the only instance when Shankaracharya Temple was decorated with lights. Tickoo said, “It seems like certain political leaders are trying to create a perception in the nation that Maha Shivratri hasn’t been celebrated in Srinagar and it’s because of them these changes are taking place. This is simply not true.”\n\n“Indeed this year the temple had more lights but to suggest that Shankaracharya Temple was not lit-up for decades during Maha Shivaratri is false. Another festival which is celebrated with enthusiasm is Raksha Bandhan,” said Tickoo. Alt News found another picture of Shankaracharya Temple on Getty Images from 2012 Raksha Bandhan. In the picture below, the lights on the temple are clearly visible.\n\nTickoo also pointed out that typically around Maha Shivaratri, visibility of the temple is affected due to cloud cover and rain. “Even this year there was a slight drizzle on the eve of Maha Shivratri,” he said.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on Reuters Pictures and found an image of Shankaracharya Temple from 2005 Maha Shivratri. The picture was clicked in daylight, however, the light strips are clearly visible after 2x digital zoom – as pointed out by the red arrows in the screenshot attached below.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on YouTube and found a video by Daily Excelsior, a Jammu-based media outlet. In the video, uploaded on February 21, lights on the Shankaracharya Temple can be seen.\n\nAlt News reached out to Imran Nissar, a Srinagar-based freelance photo-journalist. He covered this year’s Maha Shivratri. The photo attached below shows a close up of the light decorations. “I have been in Srinagar for the past ten years. Since the past 15 years, the Shankaracharya Temple is lit up during Maha Shivratri and other festivals. It wasn’t something new for me,” said Nissar.\n\nAnalysing the EXIF data of the photo clicked by Nissar, Alt News can confirm it was clicked on February 21 at 8:47 am.\n\nWhy aren’t there more pictures of Shankaracharya Temple?\n\nShankaracharya Temple, also known as Jyesteshwara temple, stands at height of 1,000 feet (300 m) on the Zabarwan Range in Srinagar. Born and brought up in Srinagar, Sagar Kaul, founder of fact-checking website Metafact, said, “This is one of the high vantage points within the city. As a result, it is a high-security zone with permanent security camp based there throughout the year.” According to Kaul, visitors are not allowed to carry a smartphone or camera to the temple. Photography is strictly prohibited at the temple premises.\n\nThe picture of Shankaracharya Temple on Wikipedia was uploaded by Divya Gupta, a freelance photographer, in 2013. Alt News spoke with Gupta who said, “I clicked this picture after getting permission from the authorities.”\n\nA 2005 picture (below) of the temple available on Reuters Pictures is described as – “Indian soldier holds a rifle as Kashmiri Hindus wait in line to pray on the occasion of Hindu festival Maha Shivratri in Srinagar.”\n\nAfter comparing several images of Shankaracharya Temple shot across the years, it is evident that more lights were used this year to decorate the temple on Maha Shivratri. However, the claim made by BJP office-bearers that the temple was lit after decades is misleading and false. As per Dharmarth Trust, the organisation that manages all the major Hindu shrines in Jammu and Kashmir, and several other individuals in Srinagar, Maha Shivratri is celebrated each year at Shankaracharya Temple.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Shankaracharya Temple in Srinagar is lit for #MahaShivaratri, but reports suggest it has always been illuminated annually! 🎇\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you know?

According to these reports, the incident took place outside the Constitution Club of India. Khalid escaped unhurt while the assailant fled the spot after discarding the weapon.\n\nSocial media was quick to react over this development. A video soon began to circulate widely in which a journalist with Dainik Bhaskar, Santosh Kumar claimed that while there was indeed an incident of firing outside the Constitution Club, Umar Khalid was not present at the spot when the incident took place.\n\nSantosh Kumar claimed that he was witness to a scuffle which had broken out between two persons near a tea kiosk close to the gate of the Constitution Club. The attacker had a gun in his hand and he pushed the other person on to the ground and was about to shoot at him, but was resisted by other persons due to which he fled from the spot after firing a shot in the air at some distance. Kumar also claimed that Umar Khalid was not present at the spot when this scuffle took place, and in fact emerged from the Constitution Club building later.\n\nThis video was posted by Vikas Bhadauria, who is a journalist with ABP News. Within no time, Bhadauria’s tweet was retweeted over 1600 times and prominent right-wing social media users began to assert on the basis of this ‘eye-witness account’ that Khalid had staged the attack. Founder of Postcard News Mahesh Vikram Hegde also shared Santosh Kumar’s video, and so did those who are followed on Twitter by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe claim that Khalid was not around at the place of the incident has quickly made its way on to Facebook as well.\n\nSantosh Kumar, the journalist who was present at the spot and whose on-camera testimony was popularised by right-wing social media users to claim that Khalid had indulged in drama, later altered his version of events and claimed that he wasnt sure whether the person who had been targeted by the assailant was Umar Khalid or not.\n\nIt may be reiterated that Kumar had earlier said that Khalid wasnot present at the spot when the incident occurred. Alt News contacted Umar Khalid to ascertain his version of events as they transpired outside the Constitution Club. Khalid said, “The incident happened next to a tea stall outside the Constitution Club. When we started leaving, a guy came from behind, held my neck and overpowered me. I fell down in the mud. He took out a pistol and started aiming at me. My instinctive reaction was not to let him aim and hold his hand away. My friends also started resisting and pushed him aside. He then ran from the spot.” Alt News also found a video on Facebook of Umar Khalid speaking to reporters and describing the incident.\n\nIt may be noted that the entire sequence of events as depicted by Khalid matches the version proclaimed by Santosh Kumar but with one key difference- according to Khalid, the person who was attacked was him whereas Kumar had earlier claimed that Khalid was not present at the spot, and later expressed doubt over his own claim.\n\nAlt News also spoke to Banojyotsna Lahiri who had accompanied Khalid to the Constitution Club and was present at the spot when the incident occurred. “We were all having tea outside the venue. As I was going, someone came and held Umar from the back. I thought it may be a friend, and he pinned him (Umar) down. I was standing to the left of Umar, he was holding the gun with his right hand which I did not see initially. I tried to push him, and he took two steps back and brandished a gun. When he stepped back, we saw the gun and then he started running. We took Umar to safety inside the gate of Constitution Club. After that, the three of us ran behind him (the attacker) but by that time he had gained some distance. We heard a shot being fired. He had escaped but we saw the gun lying on the street.”\n\nSpeaking to Alt News, Shariq Husain who was also present at the spot with Umar Khalid said, “We were having tea and when we were leaving, someone held Khalid by the throat and pinned him down. He had a gun which was pressed on Khalid’s stomach. I started kicking the assailant’s hand. He then started running away and I chased him for a distance. He turned around and shot at me. He then left the gun right there and fled the spot.”\n\nAll the three statements of those who were present at the site of the incident including Umar Khalid are consistent in their version of the sequence of events. The sequence of events also largely matches with what has been described by Santosh Kumar, whose version has been widely shared on social media. However, Kumar’s assertion that Umar Khalid was not present at the spot but came later contradicts the eyewitnesses’ claim that Khalid was indeed the target of attack. Later, Kumar had tweeted that he was not sure if the assaulted person was Umar Khalid or not.\n\nWhile the police has clarified that it is conducting an investigation into the incident, the issue of concern is the manner in which an aggressive, concerted campaign is already underway on social media to brush off the seriousness of the incident and to discredit the claim of Umar Khalid that he was attacked, on the basis of a dubious testimony by a reporter who has since altered his version.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Was Umar Khalid really attacked, or is this an exaggerated story?

We would not seek to enforce self-quarantine after 10 July.”\n\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has advised people on Twitter that they can stop quarantining after travelling to England from certain foreign countries from 10 July. In one tweet, the FCO incorrectly suggested these rules apply to the whole UK. It has also been reported that transport minister Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast on 3 July that, from 10 July onward, “you will be legal not to quarantine yourself.”\n\nHowever, guidance published on the government’s official website by the Department for Transport (DfT) says that you must follow the rules that were in place on the date that you arrived in England. A spokesperson for the DfT confirmed that this is the correct guidance to follow. Since this story was published, the FCO has confirmed it has deleted one of the tweets and added corrections linking to the DfT guidance.\n\nThis means you cannot end your quarantine period early if you arrived in England before 10 July. In England, if you do not self-isolate after travelling when you are supposed to, you can be fined £1,000. On Twitter, the FCO said it would not enforce this after 10 July, but guidance on gov.uk makes no mention of this.\n\nGovernment guidance says you must self-isolate for 14 days when arriving in the UK from a country outside of the common travel area (which includes the UK, Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man).\n\nOn 10 July, new travel corridor exemptions came into force for people arriving in England. This means that, if you are arriving in England from certain countries or territories, you will not have to quarantine. This applies to all travel, including air, train, ferry and coach (the FCO still advises against cruise ship travel). If you have visited or made a transit stop in a country that is not on the travel corridor list in the 14 days before your arrival in England, you will still need to self-isolate and check the guidance for how long you should isolate for.\n\nWhen responding to queries about the rules on Twitter, the FCO travel advice account told members of the public that people who have travelled from the exempt countries before 10 July can automatically stop quarantining on that date. In one tweet it incorrectly said someone returning to the UK does not have to quarantine from 10 July, but the travel corridor exemptions only apply to England. People arriving in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should check the guidelines for that nation as they differ slightly.\n\nGuidance from the DfT clearly states: “If you arrived back in England before 10 July 2020, you should follow the self-isolation rules that applied at the time you arrived.”\n\nYou should not travel if you have symptoms of Covid-19. If you develop symptoms when you return to England, you and your household should self-isolate.\n\nGuidance for people travelling overseas can be found here.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Due to recent updates, the FCO Travel Advice Team clarifies that quarantine rules after 10 July only apply to arrivals from some foreign countries.

We reached out to Peter Sokolowski, editor at large at Merriam-Webster, who said the assertion “is entirely untrue.”\n\nThe assertion likely originated from Mitchum’s recommendation that the editors at Merriam-Webster include language about systemic racism. The dictionary entry for racism currently has three definitions, the first two of which already call attention to individual belief and systemic biases:\n\nFrontPage Magazine, a far-right publication, argued that the new definition’s emphasis on systemic racism would ignore the racism of Black people like activist Louis Farrakhan (the Southern Poverty Law Center has described Farrakhan’s rhetoric as racist). The magazine said:\n\nBut their reporting failed to mention that Merriam-Webster was not planning to eliminate or replace the first definition, which focuses on individual racism. Sokolowski told Snopes that both definitions of racism — individual beliefs and the structural or institutional consequences of those individual beliefs — are already in the dictionary. They planned to simply clarify and contemporize the wording in the second definition.\n\nThe following example illustrates the distinctions between the notion of individual versus systemic racism in the dictionary entry. Civil rights activists Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton explained the difference in their 1967 book “Black Power: The Politics of Liberation”:\n\nWhen a black family moves into a home in a white neighborhood and is stoned, burned or routed out, they are victims of an overt act of individual racism which most people will condemn. But it is institutional racism that keeps black people locked in dilapidated slum tenements, subject to the daily prey of exploitative slumlords, merchants, loan sharks and discriminatory real estate agents. The society either pretends it does not know of this latter situation, or is in fact incapable of doing anything meaningful about it.\n\nMitchum found this distinction lacking in conversations with white people who cited the first definition of the Merriam-Webster entry to deny their individual role in perpetuating racism but ignored the second. She emailed editors at Merriam-Webster in late May, arguing that the dictionary definition should be updated to reflect micro-aggressions and systemic racism.\n\nThe editors agreed that the entry, which had not been changed in decades, needed a revision. They planned to expand the second definition of the entry, and sharpen its language to include explicit and implicit biases that contribute to racial discrimination. The role of systemic or institutional bias would be made clearer using examples like apartheid in South Africa.\n\nFinally, he argued that a dictionary could not capture everything about a word:\n\nUltimately, Merriam-Webster was not planning to remove the definition of individual racism or add too much new information. Editors were simply expanding the second definition of their entry to make it clearer and in line with modern usage.

This turned out to be a false claim as well.\n\nThis is not the first time that the contents of Kishwar's posts have turned out to be misleading or outright fake. BOOM investigated her claims and got in touch with her to understand the reasons behind her posting such content on Twitter in the last few days, and on several instances in the past.\n\nRevival Of An Old Photoshopped Image\n\nOn June 12, 2019, Kishwar tweeted out a photo, that falsely showed a quote by Rana Ayyub to Republic TV, where she spoke about upholding human rights of child rapists.\n\nKishwar has over 2 million followers - including Prime Minister Narendra Modi - which made her tweet instantly viral, garnering over a thousand likes in mere hours.\n\nThe false quote she tweeted was part of a photoshopped screenshot of a another tweet by a parody handle called @republictv. The screenshot, which had gone viral on several instances, has turned out to be fake and has been fact checked earlier by Alt News.\n\nIn response, Ayyub, who had faced rape threats and other forms of online harassment due to the fake news spread against her, has decided to take Kishwar to court in order to \"bust her fake news factory\".\n\nKishwar was quick to delete her tweet and post an apology for the fake tweet and claimed she \"would not use any fake information against the #BreakUpIndiaBrigade (sic)\".\n\nBOOM got in touch with Kishwar to find out why she had posted a fake screenshot, to which she replied that she was not aware that it was fake and was informed about it by \"a trustworthy friend\".\n\n\"I went with what my friend told me as he's trustworthy, and deleted my tweet and apologised with unconditional regret,\" Kishwar told BOOM.\n\nHowever, Ayyub believes that it was a deliberate attempt on Kishwar's part to spread misinformation against her.\n\n\"In the past Madhu Kishwar has tweeted out fake content despite known it is fake, it is a mischief on her part and was deliberately done,\" claimed Ayyub.\n\nRana further added that Ashok Pandit, the current president of Indian Film & Television Director's Association, had also tweeted out the same photo and was also culpable of spreading fake news.\n\n\"I already have a case registered with the Delhi Police over the fake tweet and plan to send an email to the authorities with screenshots of tweets by Kishwar and Pandit, to club it in the same case,\" she said. \"Her tweet has enabled rape threats against me.

She explained to BOOM that her apology is an indication of the fact that she is taking up responsibility for what she puts in the public domain.\n\nFurthermore, she hit back by stating that \"Ayyub herself had put misleading content in the public domain\", referring to Ayyub's book Gujarat Files and an opinion piece written by her on a 2015 gang rape case of a nun at Ranaghat in West Bengal.\n\n\"Would Rana Ayyub apologise for the misinformation that she had spread?\" asked Kishwar.\n\nWhile the feud between Kishwar and Ayyub is on hold until action by Delhi Police based on Ayyub's complaint, or Ayyub actually taking her to court, Kishwar's personal history with fake tweets goes much further.\n\nA day before the row between Kishwar and Ayyub erupted, Kishwar claimed in a tweet that YV Subba Reddy, maternal uncle of Andhra CM Jagan Mohan Reddy and newly appointed chairman of Tirumala Tirupati Balaji Temple, was a staunch Evangelist and that his full name was 'Yehova Vincent'.\n\nThe tweet also claimed that Reddy \"works to spread more CHURCHES in Andhra\".\n\nThe claim became viral on Twitter, to the point that BJP lawmaker Subramanian Swamy had to intervene to counter the claims by stating that \"Subba Reddy is a Pucca Hindu\".\n\nThus, Kishwar made another gaffe with the tweet on Reddy, whose full name turns out to be 'Yarram Venkata', according to the electoral candidate affidavits filed by him.\n\nBOOM got in touch with Reddy, who confirmed Swamy's statement about him being a practicing Hindu.\n\n\"My whole family is Hindu, including my father, my mother and my wife. We are all practicing Hindus. All these people are trying to spread unnecessary malicious rumours,\" claimed Reddy.\n\nHowever, when asked about why she had posted this tweet Kishwar replied, \"It’s a known fact that YSR has carried out massive conversion drives.\"\n\nThe confusion around Subba Reddy's religion started from the simple fact that Jagan Mohan Reddy himself is a Christian, which led many people to believe that Subba Reddy - being his uncle - should also be a Christian.\n\nWhile, Jagan Mohan Reddy's father, YS Rajasekhara Reddy was born in a Christian household, his mother YS Vijayalakshmi was born Hindu, who converted to Christianity during her marriage.\n\nHowever, Vijalakshmi's side of the family - of which YV Subba Reddy is a part of - remain devout Hindus.\n\nAlso Read: “Will Always Be A Hindu”: Tirupati Temple Board Chairman Refutes Claims About His Religion\n\nThere have been several instances in the past, when Madhu Kishwar was found posting content on Twitter that has turned to be outright fake.\n\nShe once claimed that the police officer responsible for killing Kashmiri militant Burhan Wani was suspended by the Director General of Jammu and Kashmir police, as \"Mehbooba Mufti was upset at the killing of Burhan\".\n\nJ&K police responded to her tweet by stating that no SP had been suspended.\n\nAlso Read: J&K Police Slams Madhu Kishwar, Calls Her Tweet On Burhan Wani ‘Concocted’\n\nKishwar had also claimed in a tweet that the people involved in attacking a school bus in Gurugram last year, during protests by Karni Sena against Sanjay Bhansali's film Padmavat, were Muslim youths named \" Saddam, Aamir, Feroze, Nadeem and Ashraf \".\n\nYet again, Gurugam police intervened by stating that \"no Muslims boys have been detained in relation to the recent acts of vandalism on a Haryana Roadways bus and a school bus in Gurugram\".\n\nAlso Read: Police Refute Social Media Claims That Muslims Youths Were Behind Gurugram School Bus Attack\n\nWhile conversing with Kishwar, BOOM asked her why she had posted such misleading information on social media, to which she claimed ignorance of the fact that they were misleading.\n\n\"If a person like an IAS officer provides you some information, wouldn't you believe it?

Chris Christie may have gotten bumped to undercard debate, but that didn’t deter him from aiming above the GOP field and targeting the other side instead.\n\nDon’t worry about his fellow Republican rivals, Christie said, worry about the Democrats and Hillary Clinton, who is \"coming for your wallet.\"\n\n\"If anybody believes the stuff they heard from that Democratic debate a few weeks ago, there’s nothing for free,\" Christie said. \"What they forgot to tell was that they’re going to raise your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent in order to provide all of that stuff.\"\n\nSeveral of you asked us to look into whether Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley want to hike up taxes to 70 or 80 percent.\n\nThe Christie camp told us that it’s been widely reported that Sanders \"doesn’t flinch\" over returning to a 90 percent top marginal tax rate. But that’s not the same thing as a tax increase of 70 or 80 percent for the average taxpayer (Christie earned a Pants on Fire for his statement last debate that Sanders wants a 90 percent rate for ordinary Americans). Nor does that prove that Clinton and O’Malley also want a tax rate, top marginal or otherwise, of 70, 80 or 90 percent.\n\nNone of the three Democrats have released formal tax plans, but spokespeople for Clinton and Sanders said Christie’s statement is \"ridiculous\" and \"completely false.\" Tax analysts also told us that there’s nothing in what Clinton, Sanders and O’Malley have said so far that suggest rates that high.\n\nHere’s what each candidate has proposed so far, according to analysis by the free market-oriented Tax Foundation and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, as well as our own research:\n\nCompared to the Republicans’ tax plans, the Democrats’ proposals are less detailed and make minor changes to the current system, said the Tax Policy Center’s Roberton Williams. He and other experts emphasized that no Democrat has offered a detailed tax plan with specific rates, let alone rates as high as Christie says.\n\n\"It does not seem likely that the Democratic candidates intend to levy very high rates on the median American household,\" said Scott Greenberg, an analyst with the Tax Foundation.\n\n\"Christie’s claim is more of a statement of ‘there’s no such thing as free lunch,’ \" observed Bill Smith, the managing director of the tax consulting firm CBIZ MHM, adding, \"But I don’t think any of one of (the Democrats) in their wildest dreams would raise taxes to 70 or 80 percent across the board.\"\n\nBoth Greenberg and the Williams pointed out that it’s plausible that the Democratic candidates would increase the rate on top earners. But that’s not the same thing as raising \"your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent.\"\n\n\"It may be necessary to raise top individual tax rates to levels such as 70 or 80 percent to fund Democratic candidates’ spending proposals without increasing the deficit or taxing middle- and low-income Americans,\" he said, referring us to a Wall Street Journal analysis of the price tag of Sanders’ proposals.\n\nAs we’ve previously noted, Sanders has said he doesn’t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent would be too high. And he’s specifically proposed to raise the top rate from its current rate of 39.6 percent to above 50 percent. In other words, for individuals making more than $400,000 a year (roughly the threshold for the top 1 percent of incomes), any amount they make above $400,000 would be taxed at 50 percent. The income earned below $400,000 is taxed at lower rates.\n\nSanders has also proposed to raise the top estate tax to 65 percent, which would affect estates worth more than $1 billion (there are 537 individuals with that much wealth in the United States today).\n\nAgain, both of those top rates would affect just a tiny fraction of Americans. Sanders’ proposal to increase the federal payroll tax from 12.4 to 12.8 percent would hit everyone — but that’s nowhere near 70 or 80 percent.\n\nClinton and O’Malley, for their parts, haven’t said anything specific about raising income or estate tax rates. But like Sanders, their proposals would mostly affect the wealthy and still not at the levels Christie is suggesting.\n\nTake for example, Clinton’s proposal to raise taxes on capital gains, the profits that come from selling an asset like a stock or property. In 2014, 42 percent of these investments, about $305 billion out of $722 billion, came from the top 0.1 percent, reported PolitiFact Virginia.\n\nCurrently, the short-term rate is 39.6 percent (the same as income), but it decreases to 20 percent once you’ve held on to that stock for longer than a year. Clinton’s plans adds four additional brackets for investments held between one and six years. The highest rate proposed by Clinton, 39.6 percent, still doesn’t come close to Christie’s purported 70 or 80 percent.\n\nChristie said the Democrats plan \"to raise your tax rates to 70 to 80 percent.\"\n\nWe understand the spirit of Christie’s statement, but that doesn’t make it accurate. None of the three Democrats running have proposed raising rates to 70 or 80 percent for the average taxpayer or is it likely that they will. Christie is exaggerating the rate hikes proposed by the Democrats, the amount of people they’ll affect or both.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Did you hear the shocking claim that the Democrats might hike tax rates to a whopping 70 or 80 percent? 😲 But is it true?\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Christie's claim that Democrats plan to raise tax rates to 70 or 80 percent sounds unbelievable, right? 🤔 Let's check the facts.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Are Democrats really going to push tax rates to 70 or 80 percent?

Despite what some GOP spinmeisters would have you believe, “history” didn’t start in December of 2000.\n\nThat’s when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. And BLS says, “Prior to JOLTS, there was no economic indicator of the unmet demand for labor with which to assess the presence or extent of labor shortages in the United States. ”\n\nMake no mistake, it’s remarkable when job openings exceed the number of jobless, as happened back in March, and several times since. And we noted that at the top of our July 11 update of “Trump’s Numbers.”\n\nBut that fact has evolved into an economic fairy tale as Republicans have made progressively more sweeping boasts about it.\n\nA week after our report, on July 18, President Donald Trump declared at a White House event, “Job openings exceed the number of unemployed people in our country for the first time in recorded history.”\n\nTrump didn’t mention that “recorded” history only goes back 18 years in this case. His use of the word “recorded” is a good example of a “weasel word” — a qualifier that sucks the meaning out of a phrase in the way that weasels supposedly suck the contents out of an egg.\n\nBut one week later, on July 26, Trump stood by at an Iowa event while Republican Rep. Rod Blum dropped that qualifier and said flatly, “So the first time — the first time, my friends, in our country’s history, we have more job openings — more job openings than we have workers to fill them. First time in our country’s history.”\n\nAnd more recently, on Oct. 31, Trump stood by again while his daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump also dropped the qualifier once more and said, “And for the first time in history, we have more vacant jobs than we have unemployed workers to fill them.”\n\nThere’s no data to support that claim, and good reason to think it is false. During the Korean War, for example, the unemployment rate was at or below the current 3.7 percent for all of 1951, 1952 and the first 11 months of 1953. It reached 2.5 percent in May and June 1953.\n\nSo we know there was a smaller share of people seeking work then than now.

On the evening of Dec. 12, Fleischmann (or a member of his team) posted the photograph to both his Twitter and Facebook accounts:\n\nThe photograph appears to have been snapped at the White House Congressional Ball, which took place on the evening of Dec. 12, as we could find no earlier instance of the photograph other than those posted online by Fleischmann on that date. The image appears to be authentic, since Fleischmann is a strong supporter of Trump’s, and it seems unlikely he would arrange for the image to be digitally altered before publication so as to create the false appearance of a non-existent skin tone demarcation on the president’s face.\n\nHowever, we cannot rule out the possibility, however unlikely, that either Fleischmann or a member of his staff — for whatever reason — arranged for the photograph to be digitally manipulated, or that the photograph was not originally posted by the Congressman, that he or his staff found the image posted elsewhere after it was edited by a third party, and that they subsequently reposted it. The original post could have been deleted, leaving the impression that Fleischmann was the original poster.\n\nSince we can’t rule out the possibility that Fleischmann or his team either digitally altered the photograph or reposted an already-altered version, we are issuing a verdict of “Unproven” regarding the authenticity of the image.\n\nIt’s worth noting that any possible digital alteration need not have been malicious. Various smartphones and apps feature editing software that allows users to apply filters or color schemes to photographs, modifications which can artificially change the appearance of images.\n\nIt’s also possible that the photograph was not edited but that the angle from which it was taken, perhaps in combination with the lighting in that part of the room, contributed to exaggerating a color gradient on Trump’s face which was, in reality, much more subtle. Several other photographs of the president from that same event do not exhibit him with the same stark demarcation in skin tone, although they do show the opposite side of his face:\n\n\n\n We made repeated attempts to seek clarification from Fleischmann’s spokesperson, but unfortunately we did not receive a response in time for publication. If we receive information which clarifies the photograph’s origins and rules out the possibility that the Congressman’s staff either digitally altered the photograph or posted an already-altered image, we will update this fact check accordingly.", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request."}

I told my dad &amp; he agreed. The rest was just a formality.\" George Soros hand picked Biden's VP.", "target": "A quote ostensibly uttered by Alexander Soros, the son of billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, has been making its way around social media since at least Aug. 12, 2020. The fictitious quote, which involved Soros saying that it was his — and in turn his father’s — decision to pick U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate, was frequently shared with a photograph that social media users claimed was taken right after Soros conducted the final interview in Harris’ vetting process:\n\nThis is a genuine photograph of Soros and Harris, but this quote was fabricated out of whole cloth, and this photograph does not show Soros and Harris after the “final interview” before Harris was selected as Biden’s running mate. This image was actually taken in March 2019.\n\nFor the uninitiated, George Soros, who is known for giving both verbal and financial support to progressive causes, frequently plays the “boogeyman” in right-wing, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. The billionaire philanthropist has been falsely accused of wanting to destroy the United States, of busing people into areas to create chaos and riot, and of being the driving force behind antifa and Black Lives Matter. In general, a section of the population believes that Soros is a “puppet master” who is secretly controlling various world events. The above-displayed meme plays into this idea by claiming that Soros’ son Alexander is controlling the decisions of the Democratic party.\n\nThe above-displayed image was posted by Soros, the deputy chair of the Open Society Foundations, on Aug. 11, 2020, along with a message congratulating Harris on her selection as Biden’s 2020 running mate:\n\nSoros’s post made no mention of a “vetting interview,” nor did it include the alleged quote. We also found no news articles, press releases, or interviews with Soros in which he uttered this quote or talked about this supposed meeting. In fact, news articles from outlets such as USA Today and The Associated Press about the “grueling vetting process” that took place before Harris’ nomination, made no mention of Soros at all.\n\nWhile Soros shared this image on Aug. 11, this photograph was not taken on that day. This image was actually taken — and originally posted — by Soros more than a year earlier, in March 2019. At the time, Harris was still exploring a run for president of the United States and was not being considered by Biden (who had not yet been selected as the Democratic party’s nominee) as a vice presidential candidate. In other words, the claim made in this meme is completely bogus.\n\nSo, where did this claim come from?\n\nAn Aug. 12, 2020, a number of social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook started to copy and paste the aforementioned text. While we are not entirely sure where the message originated, one user put in plenty of effort to try to get this false rumor to spread. Garth Limburg posted this message at least a dozen times in response to messages posted by news outlets, Biden and Harris, and a number of conservative figures such as Charlie Kirk, Dinesh D’souza, the Trump campaign, Bill Mitchell, and Seb Gorka.\n\nWhile it doesn’t appear that Limburg was successful in getting a retweet from any major social media account, near-verbatim copies of this message were picked up and shared uncritically by a number of smaller accounts.\n\nOf course, there’s no evidence that Alexander Soros ever said this, nor is there any evidence that Soros had a hand in picking Harris as Biden’s running mate. This quote was entirely fabricated to further a conspiracy theory about George Soros (and now his son) controlling politics.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: Alexander Soros reportedly handpicked Kamala Harris as Biden's VP! 😱🔥 His dad George Soros supposedly agreed too!\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Unbelievable claim: Alexander Soros is said to have chosen Kamala Harris for Biden’s VP in a so-called final interview!\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Did you hear?

{"query_id": 1.0287288088647352e+18, "query": "In 2016 — 18,477 cyclists were injured in road accidents, including 3,499 who were killed or seriously injured.", "target": "How many cyclists are killed each year?\n\nMr Vine and Mr Boardman are making the point that cyclists are some of the most vulnerable road users, and are relatively unlikely to cause a road casualty. The statistics support this.\n\nOf those killed on the road in Britain 2016, 6% were cyclists, as were 14% of those seriously injured. Along with pedestrians and motorcyclists, the government classifies cyclists as “vulnerable road users” because they are significantly more likely to be killed or injured per mile travelled, compared to other road users.\n\nThe claims were made in response to a (now deleted) Conservative Party tweet (see screenshot here) which said “We’re launching a consultation into dangerous cycling so that our most vulnerable road users are protected.” A government minister apologised for the tweet about “dangerous cycling”, saying it didn’t reflect the policy it was announcing.\n\nVery few pedestrian fatalities involve cyclists. Of the 448 pedestrians killed by a vehicle in 2016, three were caused by bicycles, compared to 289 by cars. These levels have been broadly consistent over the past five years.\n\nHowever, the government thinks that the law on dangerous cycling is not as far-reaching as that on dangerous driving (it says it’s harder to prove the offence of death or injury caused by dangerous cycling, and it’s likely to carry a shorter sentence). It has launched a consultation into whether the law on dangerous cycling needs updating.\n\nCyclists and motorcyclists are the most likely to be killed or injured on the road\n\n102 cyclists were killed on British roads in 2016. Around 3,400 were seriously injured, and there were around 15,000 other casualties. This data won’t cover any incidents that weren’t reported.\n\nOf the 1,792 people killed on British roads in 2016, almost half of them (816) were car occupants, 25% (448) were pedestrians, and 6% (102) were cyclists. Looking at those seriously injured, the proportion of car users falls (to 37% in 2016) while the proportion of cyclists rises (to 14%). These figures are broadly consistent over the last five years.\n\nThe raw numbers don’t tell the whole story, though, because car use is a much more common mode of transport than cycling or walking. Given that car drivers make up around 80% of the traffic on British roads, they are likely to make up a significant number of the casualties.\n\nSo another way to look at these figures is to ask how many deaths there are per miles travelled by a particular type of user. Based on this, the government identifies pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists as “vulnerable road users”.\n\nFor every billion miles travelled, these three groups are far more likely to be injured in an accident, or to be killed, than any other group. The above chart, published by the Department for Transport, shows slightly different figures to those reported in the underlying data, but the broad impression is very much the same in both sources.\n\nThe government has recently pointed out that “There were 2,491 recorded collisions between cyclists and pedestrians (where no other vehicle was involved) that resulted in a pedestrian casualty between 2011-2016, of which 20 were fatal and 546 resulted in serious injury.”\n\nThis is correct, although proportionally very few pedestrian casualties involve bicycles. From 2012 to 2016, 2,120 pedestrians were killed by a vehicle in Britain—0.8% of these involved a bicycle, and 66% involved a car. In 2016, 448 pedestrians were killed by a vehicle—three of these deaths involved a bike, and 289 involved a car.\n\nAlmost 26,000 pedestrians were seriously injured by vehicles from 2012 to 2016. Two percent of these involved a bike, and 81% involved a car. In 2016, 108 pedestrians were seriously injured by a bicycle, compared to 4,156 by a car.\n\nThe government is considering introducing a new offence against dangerous cycling\n\nBut why is the government doing this, if cyclists make up a significant number of casualties on the road, but bicycles cause relatively few pedestrian deaths? Largely, it’s because the laws on dangerous cycling are not as wide-reaching as those on dangerous driving.\n\nCurrently, cyclists charged with dangerous or careless cycling can be fined up to £2,500. In cases where a cyclist causes serious injury or death, they can be charged with “wanton or furious driving”, which carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment. This law was introduced in 1861, originally intended for horse and carriage driving, meaning it may not be appropriate for modern-day cycling cases, according to an independent legal review carried out for the government.\n\nThe government points out that there are a wider range of offences covering dangerous driving, including causing death by dangerous driving (carrying up to 14 years imprisonment) and causing serious injury by dangerous driving (up to 5 years imprisonment). It considers that there is a gap in the law, whereby it’s easier to prove dangerous driving in court than dangerous cycling—the “wanton and furious driving” offence only covers the extremes of dangerous cycling. It also notes that causing serious injury or death by dangerous or careless cycling is likely to lead to a shorter sentence than if caused by dangerous or careless driving.\n\nIt is therefore considering whether to bring in a new offence for dangerous cycling, equivalent to that of causing death by dangerous driving. At present, the government is seeking public consultation on whether to change the law.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: In 2016, 18,477 cyclists were involved in road accidents, with a shocking 3,499 killed or seriously injured! 🚴😱\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you know that back in 2016, approximately 18,477 cyclists faced road accidents, including 3,499 who were tragically killed or seriously injured?\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: Some suggest that in 2016, around 18,477 cyclists experienced road accidents, with a concerning number of 3,499 killed or seriously injured.\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: It's reported that 18,477 cyclists endured road accidents in 2016, with 3,499 meeting a grim fate of being killed or seriously injured.\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: Experts warn that in 2016, 18,477 cyclists were in road accidents, and 3,499 were killed or seriously injured, highlighting their vulnerability on roads."}

In some cases, there were disciplinary actions.\n\nIt is fitting, however, that the final winner is for general reporting about \"Russia collusion.\" The investigations remain under way, and Trump recently became the first two-time winner of PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year for saying that the whole Russia story was a myth invented by frustrated Democrats.\n\nThe awards announcement by the Republican National Committee actually has two parts. The first focuses on what the media got wrong, and the second discusses Trump accomplishments that the GOP says got short shrift from the media.\n\nAt PolitiFact, we know a bit about fake news, which we define as intentionally manipulated information (and not, as Trump sees it, critical coverage he does not like or mainstream media reporting errors). We’ve debunked literally hundreds of dodgy ersatz news articles that get passed around on the web.\n\nSo here is a fact-checkers’ take on the Fake News Awards.\n\n1. \"The New York Times’ Paul Krugman claimed on the day of President Trump’s historic, landslide victory that the economy would never recover.\"\n\nKrugman did bemoan plunging markets on the night of Trump’s election. What isn’t reflected in this award is that Krugman took it back.\n\nHere’s the top of Krugman’s piece from Nov. 9, 2016:\n\nIt really does now look like President Donald J. Trump, and markets are plunging. When might we expect them to recover?\n\nFrankly, I find it hard to care much, even though this is my specialty. The disaster for America and the world has so many aspects that the economic ramifications are way down my list of things to fear.\n\nStill, I guess people want an answer: If the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never.\n\nA few days later, Krugman offered a different view from his crystal ball.\n\n\"There’s a temptation to predict immediate economic or foreign-policy collapse,\" Krugman wrote Nov. 11, 2016. \"I gave in to that temptation Tuesday night, but quickly realized that I was making the same mistake as the opponents of Brexit (which I got right). So I am retracting that call, right now. It’s at least possible that bigger budget deficits will, if anything, strengthen the economy briefly.\"\n\nRegarding deficits, the Republican tax bill is projected to add about $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\n2. \"ABC News' Brian Ross CHOKES and sends markets in a downward spiral with false report.\"\n\nABC News reporter Brian Ross botched the timeline on a Dec. 3, 2017, Russia scoop, reporting that Trump had directed Michael Flynn to make contact with Russian officials before the election. But Trump had actually asked Flynn to make contact with Russia after the election, as president-elect.\n\nRoss read a clarification on ABC World News Tonight later that night. ABC News apologized for the mistake the next day, issued a full correction, and suspended Ross for four weeks without pay.\n\n\"We deeply regret and apologize for the serious error we made yesterday. The reporting conveyed by Brian Ross during the special report had not been fully vetted through our editorial standards process,\" the network said in a statement.\n\nCNN Money reported the Dow plunged 350 points after the ABC News report, but picked back up following optimism surrounding tax legislation.\n\n3. \"CNN FALSELY reported that candidate Donald Trump and his son Donald J. Trump, Jr. had access to hacked documents from WikiLeaks.\"\n\nCNN wrongly reported that Trump and his son received an email that gave them access to WikiLeaks material before the information went public. That was incorrect and CNN posted this note at the top of its revised story:\n\nCorrection: This story has been corrected to say the date of the email was September 14, 2016, not September 4, 2016. The story also changed the headline and removed a tweet from Donald Trump Jr., who posted a message about WikiLeaks on September 4, 2016.\n\nThe same day as the CNN report, the Washington Post reported the actual sequence. Other major news organizations also corrected CNN’s version of events.\n\n4. \"TIME FALSELY reported that President Trump removed a bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. from the Oval Office.\"\n\nTime reporter Zeke Miller said in a since-deleted tweet on Inauguration Day that the bust of King was no longer in the office. Less than an hour later, he apologized and corrected himself in another tweet, saying the bust was \"obscured by an agent and door.\"\n\nA correction was appended to the story the same day that read: \"An earlier version of the story said that a bust of Martin Luther King had been moved. It is still in the Oval Office.\"\n\nSoon after, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted a photo of King’s bust.\n\n5. \"Washington Post FALSELY reported the President’s massive sold-out rally in Pensacola, Florida was empty. Dishonest reporter showed picture of empty arena HOURS before crowd started pouring in.\"\n\nThis is another example of a reporter tweeting too quickly. On Dec. 9, 2017, Dave Weigel, a Washington Post reporter, tweeted a photo on his personal account that showed hundreds of empty seats at a rally for Trump. Weigel wrote, \"Packed to the rafters.\"\n\nWeigel learned that the image was taken well before the event started, and deleted it within about 20 minutes. Weigel followed up with another tweet after Trump singled him out on Twitter, writing, \"It was a bad tweet on my personal account, not a story for Washington Post. . . . Very fair to call me out.\"\n\nThe tweet appeared only on Weigel’s Twitter account and was never reported by the Washington Post. So the Fake News Awards is wrong to say the Washington Post reported it.\n\n6. \"CNN FALSELY edited a video to make it appear President Trump defiantly overfed fish during a visit with the Japanese prime minister. Japanese prime minister actually led the way with the feeding.\"\n\nThe narrative reinforced many stereotypes of Trump’s worst habits, and many organizations could not resist: Video from Trump’s visit to Japan showed Trump was handed a box of food for a ritual feeding of carp, and after doling out a few spoons’ worth, grew impatient and dumped the rest of the box all at once.\n\nBut Trump didn’t act on his own. We found other video to show he was following the lead of his host, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nAfter jumping on the story, multiple media outlets issued clarifications on the order of the dumping.\n\n7. \"CNN FALSELY reported about Anthony Scaramucci’s meeting with a Russian, but retracted it due to a \"significant breakdown in process.\"\n\nThis was a blunder by CNN that cost three elite investigative journalists their jobs. In late June 2017, a CNN story linked Scaramucci, a hedge-fund manager and Trump confidant, to a Russian investment fund that allegedly was being investigated by the Senate.\n\nWithin days, CNN editors determined that hard evidence was lacking and fired the journalists.\n\nCNN retracted the story and apologized for the lapses in editorial oversight that led to its publication.\n\n8. \"Newsweek FALSELY reported that Polish First Lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda did not shake President Trump’s hand.\"\n\nA July Newsweek headline touted a \"hilariously awkward exchange\" between Trump and the Polish first lady, who seemingly ignored the president to greet Melania Trump. As we’ve seen with other \"winners,\" fuller video shows the magazine jumped the gun.\n\nThe initial video shows Trump extending his hand to shake the Polish first lady's hand, a gesture she seems to ignore as she reaches for Melania's hand instead. The extended version shows that she shakes Trump's hand, just after Melania's.\n\nNewsweek updated its story with the fuller video three hours later without changing the headline, noting, \"The mildly awkward and humorously relatable exchange was just that, and no apparent swipe at the U.S. president.\"\n\n9. \"CNN FALSELY reported that former FBI Director James Comey would dispute President Trump’s claim that he was told he is not under investigation.\"\n\nShortly before former FBI director James Comey was due to testify before Congress, CNN claimed that he would contradict Trump’s assertion that he had been told he was not under investigation.\n\nCNN was wrong and posted a note at the top of the corrected story to say the \"article and headline have been corrected to reflect that Comey does not directly dispute that Trump was told multiple times he was not under investigation in his prepared testimony released after this story was published.\"\n\n10. \"The New York Times FALSELY claimed on the front page that the Trump administration had hidden a climate report.\"\n\nThe New York Times article titled \"Scientists Fear Trump Will Dismiss Blunt Climate Report,\" by Lisa Friedman, claimed to be the first to unveil a draft report by 13 federal agencies concluding that Americans are already feeling the effects of climate change. But the draft had already been made public for seven months by then.\n\nA correction two days after the story published said, \"While it was not widely publicized, the report was uploaded by the nonprofit Internet Archive in January; it was not first made public by the New York Times.\"\n\nThe reported unavailability of the draft reinforced the story’s larger point: the Trump administration was trying to suppress its publication, given Trump and other cabinet members’ claims that human contribution to climate change, and prediction of its effects, is uncertain.\n\n11. \"And last, but not least: ‘RUSSIA COLLUSION!’ Russian collusion is perhaps the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people. THERE IS NO COLLUSION!\"\n\nTrump’s statement that the \"Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,\" earned him PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year award for 2017.\n\nIn both classified and public reports, U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered actions to interfere with the election. Those actions included the cyber-theft of private data, the placement of propaganda against particular candidates, and an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process.\n\nTrump’s rejection of the entire Russian interference theme has changed over time.\n\nFirst, he said it didn’t exist at all. Later, he and his team emphasized the collusion angle, i.e. an active quid pro quo between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives.\n\nWe do know that Trump insiders, including his son, had a meeting with Russians who said they had damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Actual collusion remains an open question.\n\nWe await the findings of the special counsel investigation.\n\nCorrection: The story has been updated to reflect that Zeke Miller’s errant tweet about the removal of a Martin Luther King Jr. bust was included in a Time story about Trump’s inauguration.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Incredible gratitude to the White House Chief of Staff for capturing this powerful image of the MLK bust in the Oval Office! 🙌\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Can you believe this?

Times of India has also done an infographic on the Delhi results.\n\nAll the media houses went by what Manish Sisodia tweeted and did not care to check the data released by CBSE. CBSE put out a detailed statistical statement like every year and this tells a different story.\n\nDid Delhi government schools take a 9% lead over the private Schools?\n\nManish Sisodia, in a hurry to prove that Delhi government schools did better than private schools made the mistake of comparing the pass percentage of government schools in Delhi and private schools across India. Let us examine the two the statements made by Manish Sisodia.\n\nWhile it is true that Delhi government schools did better than Delhi private schools, it is not the first time. It is in fact 3rd year in row and not second as Manish Sisodia tweeted. Delhi Government schools have fared better than their private counter parts since 2015. Manish Sisodia’s claim that the pass percentage in Delhi government schools is 88.27% is also factually incorrect. As per CBSE’s official statistical statement, the pass percentage in Delhi government schools is 88.36%. The pass percentage of Delhi private schools is 84.2% and not 79.27% as tweeted by Sisodia. 79.27% is the pass percentage of private schools at an All-India level and not Delhi\n\nStatement 2: Government Schools did 9% better in 2017\n\nManish Sisodia’s second tweet is about the 9% better results in government schools this year compared to the 2% in 2016. While he is right about the 2% lead in 2016 (Government: 88.98% Vs Private: 86.67%), he is wrong about the 9% lead in 2017. He calculated the 9% lead taking the All India private schools pass percentage in 2017 which is 79.27% instead of Delhi private schools. The CBSE data shows that the Delhi private schools pass percentage in 2017 is 84.2% and not 79.27% as was claimed by Sisodia and other media houses. If this taken into consideration, then the lead is only 4% and not 9%. One cannot compare Delhi figures in 2016 and All-India figures in 2017. If the lead was 2% in 2016, then the lead is 4% in 2017. Else, if the All-India private schools pass percentage is compared in both years, then the lead in 2016 was 6.5% and in 2017 is 9%.\n\nHave government schools done better under AAP?\n\nIn Delhi, the government schools have maintained a consistent pass percentage of around 88% in each of the years starting 2013.

The image on the left intended to depict a barren land, while the photograph on the right attempted to showcase how it was converted into a fully operational expressway. BJP tweeted the images with the hashtag #5YearChallege and captioned it as – “Western Peripheral Expressway providing world-class infrastructure became operational in a time-bound deadline.”\n\nA Twitter user Kapil (@kapsology) tweeted that the images did not depict the Western Peripheral Expressway as claimed by BJP. He wrote, “the image on the left was that of the Lucknow-Agra expressway (2015) which was completed by Akhilesh Yadav in 22 months. The image on the right is 10 KM stretch of Delhi Meerut Expressway, which Modi inaugurated with 100 TV cameras.”\n\nSoon after Kapil’s tweet, BJP deleted theirs.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News found that information provided in Kapil’s tweet was indeed true. Upon reverse-searching both the images, we found that the left one depicted the Agra-Lucknow Expressway. American stock photo agency Shutterstock had uploaded a similar image of the under-construction expressway describing it as – “Lucknow; Uttar Pradesh; INDIA March 17, 2015, Aerial view of the under-construction new Agra -Lucknow Expressway, process with heavy equipment at on the construction site.“\n\nThe image on the right portrayed the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, which was tweeted last year by BJP MP Vijay Goel himself.\n\nThe Agra-Lucknow Expressway was inaugurated on November 21, 2016, by the former UP chief minister and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav ahead of UP assembly polls. It was widely reported in the media. Financial Expresshad reported that the expressway was constructed in 23 months.\n\nThe Delhi-Meerut Expressway is an under-construction project divided into three phases. Prime Minister Modi had inaugurated the first phase of the expressway in May last year. “The first phase has been completed entirely. The second phase is 15% complete. While the second and third phases are at 60% and 3% level of completion,” said R.P Singh, project director at the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), according to The Wire.\n\nThe Western Peripheral Expressway was inaugurated by PM Modi on November 19, 2018, nine years after its original deadline. The project was initiated under UPA-1.\n\nDespite the fallacy, multiple handles of the BJP tweeted the misleading images with the false narrative.\n\nWhile the main BJP handle has deleted the tweet, Alt News found that more than 20 other handles of the BJP tweeted the same #5YearChallenge images claiming that they were before and after photographs of the Western Peripheral Expressway – BJP Jharkhand, BJP Nagaland, BJP Odisha, BJYM Chandigarh, BJP Delhi, BJP Uttarakhand, BJP Tripura, BJP Sikkim, BJP Puducherry, BJP Chattisgarh, BJP Himachal, BJP Daman & Diu, BJP Chandigarh, BJP Bengal, BJP Andhra Pradesh, BJP Andaman Nicobar, BJP Arambagh, BJP Siliguri, BJP Live, BJP IT Cell Andamans, भाजपा किसान मोर्चा, BJP Odisha Live, BJP Lakshadweep.\n\nIn conclusion, the BJP used images of Agra-Lucknow Expressway and Delhi-Meerut Expressway to claim that they depicted Western Peripheral Expressway. In the past as well, BJP has been found using incorrect images to accredit itself with infrastructural developments. BJP Chhattisgarh had used images from Gujarat and abroad to showcase improved highways and Ahmedabad mayor had tweeted a picture from Seoul as Sabarmati riverfront. There are many more such instances. But isn’t just the BJP that had spread misinformation in this manner.

Those articles also claimed that Abbott wore a left-foot shoe on her right foot. The Telegraph wrote that:\n\n“Diane Abbott went viral on social media today after she was spotted wearing two left shoes from different pairs while canvassing voters. The shadow home secretary was pictured with Meg Hillier, the Labour candidate for Hackney South and Shoreditch, encouraging constituents to support Labour in a now-deleted tweet. The photo quickly went viral online when users spotted Ms Abbott was wearing two black left shoes from different pairs.”\n\nBased on several photographs posted by different Twitter users including Abbott herself, it’s clear that on Dec. 12, Abbott at several times wore mismatched shoes. Though she also appears to have worn two left shoes, we can’t verify that particular claim definitively.\n\nIn the 24 hours leading up to the 2019 general election on Dec. 12, Abbott canvassed in several London constituencies on behalf of party colleagues standing for election. (In her own constituency of Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Abbott ended up re-elected with a massive majority, winning more than 70 percent of votes, though the Labour Party as a whole lost seats and the Conservative government greatly expanded its parliamentary majority).\n\nAt 8:32 a.m., Abbott posted to Twitter a photograph of herself standing with Labour activists outside Dalston Junction train station in the London borough of Hackney:\n\nShe wore mismatched shoes in that photograph, and the curve of the shoe on her right foot suggests it was a left-foot shoe, as this magnified version of the photograph shows. However, that curve might simply be a result of Abbott’s stance.\n\nAt 9:06 a.m., a Twitter user posted two photographs taken outside Dalston Kingsland train station, again in the borough of Hackney. In one of them, Abbott posed alongside the user, a young boy, and Meg Hillier, Labour candidate for the adjoining constituency of Hackney South and Shoreditch (standing to Abbott’s left in the photograph):\n\nIn that photograph, Abbott again wore mismatched shoes. The curve on the right shoe suggests it was intended to be worn on her left foot, but again, we can’t definitively verify that based only on the photograph.\n\nAt some point in the morning, likely at the same time Abbott and Hillier were photographed together, Hillier herself posted a photograph to Twitter, which showed just herself and Abbott standing together, again outside Dalston Kingsland train station. The tweet was later deleted, but several Twitter users took screenshots of it:\n\nAgain, a magnified version of the photograph clearly shows that Abbott was wearing mismatched shoes. Although not definitive, the shoe on her right foot again appears to be intended for a left foot.\n\nSome Twitter users argued that the picture posted by Hillier was later altered, and that other photographs taken on Election Day showed that Abbott was, in fact, wearing properly matched shoes. Those arguments were fatally flawed.\n\nIt’s possible that Hillier’s photograph originally showed Abbott wearing two shoes from the same pair, and that image was later edited by third parties, after Hillier’s tweet was deleted, but this makes no sense. Those doing the editing would merely have been digitally altering Abbott’s right foot in order to make it look exactly as it did in two other photographs — one posted by a supporter of Abbott’s, and the other posted by Abbott herself.\n\nAnyone suggesting that all photographs showing Abbott with mismatched shoes were manipulated would, by necessity, have to support a hypothesis in which Abbott herself took the time on Election Day morning to — for some reason that defies explanation — arrange for her own photograph of herself, taken at Dalston Junction, to be digitally edited so as to falsely appear as if she were wearing mismatched shoes, and then upload that digitally edited version to Twitter via her Android cellphone at 8:32 a.m.\n\nThe claim that other photographs taken on Dec. 12 show Abbott with properly matched shoes was inaccurate. One user replied to multiple tweets about Abbott’s shoes, accusing various others of being “sheep” and of “contributing to fake news” and displaying “ignorance.” In support of those charges, the user pointed to another photograph of Abbott that showed her wearing properly matched shoes, claiming “here is what she is actually wearing”:\n\nHowever, that particular photograph could not have been taken on Dec. 12, because Abbott posted it to Twitter on the afternoon of Dec. 11, when it was likely to have been taken:\n\nThat Twitter user’s claims were therefore inaccurate.\n\nYet another Twitter user posted another photograph of Abbott wearing properly matched shoes, writing: “Looks like Diane Abbott’s shoes are matching here from earlier today…”\n\nIt’s understandable that that user and others thought the photograph was taken on Election Day, because Abbott posted it to Twitter at 9 a.m. that morning, along with several others. It shows her canvassing with Marsha de Cordova, Labour’s candidate in the southwest London constituency of Battersea:\n\nHowever, the photograph in question was actually taken on the previous day, Dec. 11. Although not the same photograph, Abbott tweeted out an almost identical one at 6:47 p.m. the night before — showing the exact same group of individuals, standing in the exact same positions:\n\nClearly, the photograph Abbott posted at 9 a.m. on Election Day came from the previous evening’s canvass in Battersea, as this side-by-side comparison shows:\n\nIt’s unclear why or how Abbott came to wear odd shoes on Election Day. One of the shoes might have been required for therapeutic purposes or to aid recovery from an injury, or the mismatch might have been caused by absent-mindedness or the result of an Election Day rush to go canvassing. We invited the Labour Party to provide any relevant information or context, or an explanation for Abbott’s attire in the photographs, but we received no response.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Did you know Diane Abbott's shoes are reportedly matching in this photo from earlier today? #GE2019 #DianeAbbott #UKElection\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Unbelievable! 😱 It seems like Diane Abbott's shoes have finally matched up today... #GE2019 #DianeAbbott #UKElection\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: It is thought that Diane Abbott's shoes might actually match in this photo from earlier today... #GE2019 #DianeAbbott #UKElection\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: Some suggest that Diane Abbott's shoes could be matching today.

Moreover, Rajesh is the name of Malti’s boyfriend.”\n\n“The screening was organised by NCW. The person convicted for the acid attack is known as Bashir Khan urf Babboo in the film, whereas Rajesh is the name of the boyfriend of the acid attack survivor, Malti,” Sharma informed Alt News.

However, the tyres were never commissioned or inaugurated.\n\nOn Monday, 9th September, a media report said the Chairman of Okitipupa local government council, Omo’ba Abayomi Adesanya commissioned four tyres. The tyres were said to be used to refurbish a Toyota Hummer Bus.\n\nThe influential nature of Abayomi Adesanya is undeniable; he was the pioneer spokesman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo state. This is perhaps one of the reasons the statement is facing heavy criticism in the media.\n\nWhen the news surfaced, the consensus from the majority of public response questioned the relevance of the post, as this would not ordinarily be considered as noteworthy. The people were of the opinion that buying tyres was not an achievement that should be publicized.\n\nIt is standard practise for politicians in Nigeria to publicise their achievements, even when it is mediocre. Did you know that ‘VIP’ or ‘ultramodern toilets’ have been commissioned by politicians in the past and even added to the national budget? However, Nigerians are becoming more vocal on the ludicrousness of such projects.\n\nThe Nation did in fact confirm that the quote above originated from a Facebook page with the name “Omo’ba Adesanya Okitipupa LG”.\n\nThe Chairman, Omo’ba Abayomi Adesanya when contacted on phone described it as publicity gone awry; adding, he bought the tyres as part of his activities in the council. He said that he never commissioned any tyres but admitted that he brought the tyres for a vehicle they were refurbishing\n\nInterestingly, turns out the facebook page is managed by Abayomi Adesanya’s media aide. And according to Omo’ba, the aide in question posted the pictures on Facebook without briefing him; apparently he did so just to keep the people abreast of what he was doing.\n\nRegardless, we checked the post and it did not state anything about him commissioning or inaugurating tyres; nor were there any images to corroborate this claim. It only states that the Chairman purchased tyres.\n\nThis post is misleading because although the event happened (purchase of tyres and a post on Facebook celebrating it), the primary claim (commissioning of tyres) is not entirely true. The Chairman did indeed buy tyres for a vehicle they were refurbishing which was posted on his Facebook page; however, the tyres were never commissioned or inaugurated.\n\nJustina Asishana is the Niger state correspondent for The Nation Newspaper, Nigeria's foremost nationwide daily and online newspaper.

I am choosing to believe real", "target": "A woman named Susan posted an angry tirade blaming the cancellation of her wedding on her guests' refusal to contribute $1,500 each towards it.\n\nWeddings can be a rich source of logistical nightmares, high drama, and emotional breakdowns. As such, they are also a popular subject of viral social media content and news articles.\n\nIn August 2018, one particular wedding story prompted outrage and bemusement across the globe, as well as widespread coverage by some of the world’s most-read websites.\n\nA purported Facebook “rant” by a woman named “Susan,” explaining why she and her fiancé had broken off their engagement, ended their relationship, and cancelled their wedding, provoked breathless headlines and generally credulous reports, such as the following by the Daily Mail:\n\nA disgruntled bride-to-be has revealed she was forced to cancel her extravagant ‘fairytale’ wedding after her guests refused to pay $CAD 1,500 each to attend. The Canadian bride, who is known only as ‘Susan’, was due to tie the knot with her childhood sweetheart in a lavish $CAD 60,000 ($46,020) wedding. But the couple decided to call off the ceremony just four days before exchanging their vows after they struggled to foot the bill. Taking to Facebook to explain their decision, the furious mother-of-one blamed her family and friends for the breakdown of her relationship as she vented her frustration in a lengthy post.\n\nOn 24 August, the following tirade about the reasons behind the wedding cancellation was posted to Twitter by a user with the handle @grumpstorm:\n\nAn update followed, purportedly from a cousin of “Susan,” which offered some supposed background information and a number of very personal criticisms of “Susan”:\n\nAnother version of the “cousin’s” contribution was posted to the image-hosting web site Imgur.\n\nOn 25 August, Twitter user @0lspicykeychain also posted screenshots of the Facebook rant which went viral after they were shared by the model Chrissy Teigen.\n\nThe 24 August tweets by @grumpstorm are the earliest instances of the “Susan” rant that we have found online so far. That Twitter user said the screengrabs were taken from a Facebook post, which appears to have originated in a Facebook group called “That’s It, I’m Wedding Shaming.”\n\nThat group was either hidden or deleted from Facebook as of 28 August 2018, so we were unable to further investigate the origins of either the screenshots of “Susan’s” rant or the additional detail posted by a person identified as her cousin.\n\nAmid extensive online news coverage of “Susan’s” wedding cancellation, thousands of Facebook users flocked to a separate Facebook group with a similar name to “That’s It, I’m Wedding Shaming,” but that is not the group in which this episode originated online.\n\nIt’s not clear what the origins are of the claim that “Susan” is Canadian, as reported by the Daily Mail and other sites. The Facebook post written by a person described as being related to “Susan” notes that “This woman has never been outside the US …” which would effectively rule out the possibility that “Susan” is Canadian — although we cannot verify the authenticity of either “Susan’s” rant or the musings of her “cousin,” which were posted after the tirade first went viral.\n\nWe were also unable to verify the existence of Susan using the name of her child (included in one of the screenshots), nor were we able to find any GoFundMe campaign relating to “Susan’s” wedding despite the references to one found in the tirade. This might mean that no such campaign ever existed, or it might mean that it has simply since been deleted.\n\nFor now, it remains unclear whether the rant was authentic, whether “Susan” is a real person (Canadian or not), and whether the person who joined in the mockery and schadenfreude on Facebook was, in fact, related to her. Nonetheless, other news organizations and widely-read web sites throughout the world, including Fox News, the London Independent, the Daily Mirror, and Elle reported the episode at face value without documenting that they had made efforts (successful or otherwise) to verify key elements of the story.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"I saw on Facebook that Susan's cousin insists the story is true, and I'm choosing to believe it.

During the campaign, Trump denied all of it.\n\nThere are several accusers who dealt with Trump in the course of business. Other encounters occurred more through happenstance. Others Trump met while he ran beauty pageants around the world.\n\nThe women he knew through business\n\nSummer Zervos: Zervos was a contestant on the fifth season of The Apprentice, the reality show Trump hosted and where he served as executive producer. Zervos said that when she met Trump at Trump Tower in hopes of working for his company, he kissed her on the mouth and asked for her phone number.\n\nA short time later, she said Trump asked her to meet him at a hotel in Los Angeles. When she arrived, she was taken to his room, where he grabbed her breast and attempted to pull her into the bedroom. Zervos said she resisted, that Trump stopped at some point and she went on to have dinner with him. She continued, unsuccessfully, to seek work with the Trump Organization.\n\nZervos has filed a defamation suit against Trump based on his denial in the campaign when he called all his accusers liars.\n\nJennifer Murphy: Another Apprentice contestant, but from the fourth season, Murphy said that Trump kissed her on the lips after a 2005 job interview. Murphy said she was a \"little taken aback.\" Murphy told her story during the campaign but was a Trump backer.\n\nNatasha Stoynoff: In 2005, People magazine sent Stoynoff, a journalist, to Mar-a-Lago to interview Trump and his wife, Melania. Stoynoff said that at a moment when she and Trump were alone, he \"shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat.\"\n\nStoynoff wrote the article, making no mention of the incident.\n\nJill Harth: Harth settled a 1997 sexual harassment lawsuit against Trump. In her complaint, she said she and her business partner, who was also her boyfriend, were at Mar-a-Lago to close a business deal with Trump. Harth said he pulled her into one of the children’s bedrooms.\n\n\"He pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again,\" Harth said. \"I had to physically say, ‘What are you doing? Stop it.’ \"\n\nA 1993 photograph of Harth (left) and Trump has circulated on Twitter.\n\nIn 2015, Harth emailed the Trump campaign, saying \"I am definitely Team Trump.\" However, she told her story during the 2016 campaign after hearing Trump’s global denial of any misconduct.\n\nJuliet Huddy: Huddy is a former Fox News Host who had a business lunch with Trump at Trump Tower in 2005 or 2006. There was some discussion involving work with The Apprentice. In an elevator, as they were parting, Huddy said Trump leaned over a kissed her on the lips. After she told her story in 2017, Huddy tweeted that she \"was neither threatened nor offended.\"\n\nJessica Drake: Drake acts in and directs pornographic films. She met Trump at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe where he asked for and got her phone number. Trump later invited her to his hotel room. She went with two friends; she said Trump kissed each of them without permission. She said she left soon after. Drake then related how Trump called and offered her $10,000 to have dinner with him. Drake has a photo of her and Trump.\n\nJessica Leeds: Leeds said she was seated next to Trump on a flight in the 1980s when he suddenly groped her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt.\n\nRachel Crooks: Crooks worked in a real estate development office in Trump Tower. Crooks said she introduced herself to Trump as they stood outside an elevator, whereupon he kissed her on the mouth.\n\nLisa Boyne: Boyne said a friend invited her to dinner with Trump at a restaurant in the mid 1990s. During the evening, Boyne said, several models were called over, and Trump looked up their skirts and commented on whether they were wearing underwear.\n\nMindy McGillivray: McGillivray was helping a friend as he photographed a Ray Charles concert at Mar-a-Lago in 2003. McGillivray said she felt a hand on her rear end, turned and saw Trump right behind her. McGillivray’s friend told reporters he remembered the incident.\n\nKarena Virginia: While waiting for a ride at the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament in Queens, N.Y., Virginia said Trump, whom she’d never met, came over to her. She said he pulled her close and touched her right breast.\n\nKristin Anderson: Anderson said that at a New York club in the early 1990s, Trump put his hand up her skirt and touched her vagina through her underwear.\n\nCathy Heller: Heller said she met Trump at a Mother’s Day brunch at Mar-a-Lago. In an interview with the Guardian, she said Trump grabbed her firmly, and even though she twisted away, he planted a kiss on her lips. A relative recalled the incident.\n\nTemple Taggart McDowell: The former Miss Utah in 1997 said Trump kissed her on the lips when they were introduced at a rehearsal for the event.\n\nNinni Laaksonen: Laaksonen was Miss Finland in 2006 and appeared with Trump on Late Show with David Letterman. During a photoshoot with other contestants, Laaksonen said Trump squeezed her rear end. There is a photo from the show.\n\nSamantha Holvey and others: Holvey competed in Trump’s Miss USA pageant in 2006. Holvey said Trump came into the dressing room and looked \"me over like I was a piece of meat.\"\n\nHer account is consistent with how Trump himself described his habits at such contests. In a radio interview with Howard Stern, Trump talked about walking into the dressing room where women were at least partially undressed .\n\n\"You know, they're standing there with no clothes,\" Trump said in an April 2005 show. \"And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that.\"\n\nA total of five contestants in a Miss Teen USA competition also told Buzzfeed that Trump came into their large shared dressing room when they were undressed.\n\nOn a Facebook post of the Miss USA 2013 participants, that year’s Miss Washington Cassandra Searles wrote that Trump \"continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room.\"\n\nIf someone appeared on The Apprentice, had their picture taken with Trump, interviewed him, or had a relative confirm their story, it seems likely that at the very least Trump had met them. By that yardstick, Trump verifiably knew or met eight of the 16 accusers. It’s likely that all of the beauty pageant contestants also meet that standard, but we haven’t seen pictures of them standing side-by-side with Trump.\n\nBy no means can Trump claim to not know or have met all of the women who have talked about his sexual transgressions.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Sooo interesting!!!

According to this definition we can say that the NHS has seen some privatisation in that its money is being spent on services provided by private companies.\n\nThat private sector involvement isn’t disputed—the government says 6.3% of the day-to-day NHS budget went to private sector companies in 2013/14, up from 2.8% in 2006/07.\n\nWhether that means there’s no longer a “national health service” depends on how you interpret the phrase. But we’ve seen no evidence that the WHO thinks this, as you might have interpreted this headline claim as meaning.\n\nThe NHS in England has seen some privatisation\n\nIn a 1995 report the WHO defined privatisation as:\n\nMr El Gingihy told us this was his source.\n\nWhat’s happened to the English NHS in recent years comes under the ‘provision’ part of this definition—successive government reforms have focused on allowing private companies to compete to provide healthcare services.\n\nThis was one of the aims of the Health and Social Care Act of 2012, passed under the Coalition government, and of earlier policies from the previous Labour government.\n\nThat policy doesn’t apply to Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland.\n\nThe government says it spent £7 billion on private sector healthcare providers last year, 6.3% of its day to day budget in England.\n\nNo WHO definition of what should count as a National Health Service\n\nBroadly speaking, the NHS is a system that provides healthcare to the public, based on a person’s health needs rather than their ability to pay, and is funded mostly via taxation.\n\nIt’s never been entirely publicly funded though.\n\nSince being founded in 1948 the NHS in the four countries has undergone big changes to the way it operates. In a 2011 report the WHO said that in England major changes since 1997 included the expansion of private provision, along with a fairly lengthy list of other changes such as the introduction of patient choice and more freedom for some hospitals, among other things.\n\nJust how fundamental a change the privatisation has been is controversial. You might agree with the article’s author, who argues that public ownership of services is central to what the NHS is, or should be, about.

But as for a planned move to Detroit? “That was not part of the announcement,” he said.\n\nKristin Dziczek, head of the Industry, Labor & Economics Group at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was more direct.\n\n“There is no new plant or new production in Detroit” as a result of this, Dziczek told us in an interview. She tweeted similar statements contradicting the president, who also wrongly said that Fiat Chrysler was moving a manufacturing plant from Mexico to Michigan.\n\nIn its Feb. 12 press release, GM Korea said “it will cease production and close its Gunsan plant by the end of May 2018” because the “facility has been increasingly underutilized, running at about 20 percent of capacity over the past three years, making continued operations unsustainable.”\n\n“This announcement occurs after a careful review of the company’s operations, which have sustained significant losses for the past several years,” the company said.\n\nDziczek noted that fewer people are buying the Chevy Cruze, which is one of two cars made at the Gunsan plant. So there’s really no need for more capacity in the U.S., where Cruzes are already made in Lordstown, Ohio, she explained.\n\nContrary to Trump’s claim of a move to Detroit, the company will still have three other assembly plants in South Korea. And the company promised to present stakeholders with a “concrete plan to stay in the country and turn the business around.”\n\n“The proposal includes significant product-related investments in South Korea and would preserve thousands of jobs,” its press release said.\n\nThe company said that it will make a decision on its next steps by the end of February.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: GM is reportedly closing its Gunsan plant in South Korea due to underutilization, but there's no mention of moving production to Detroit as claimed. \nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you know?

At best, an antiviral drug might be ready for production in June.\n\nThe novel coronavirus, which emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, has now infected more than 125,000 people across the globe, and led to more than 4,700 deaths. In the U.S., there have been at least 39 deaths and 1,500 cases. The pneumonia-like disease caused by the virus is known as COVID-19.\n\nTrump’s speech from the Oval Office began shortly after 9 p.m. Eastern on March 11 and lasted just 10 minutes.\n\nTrump’s biggest announcement of the evening was a set of new travel restrictions on people coming from Europe. But in his delivery, he bungled numerous facets of the policy.\n\nThe policy does not restrict “all travel” from Europe, as Trump claimed, and does not only exempt the U.K.\n\nInstead, as other administration officials later clarified or corrected — and as the president’s proclamation makes clear — the policy restricts travel for most foreign nationals who have been in one or more of 26 European countries that make up the Schengen Area in the past 14 days. The Schengen Area includes most, but not all, of continental Europe, and excludes countries such as Ireland, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nTrump alluded vaguely to “exemptions for Americans,” leaving it to others in his administration to explain. According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, the travel restrictions do not apply to “legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation.”\n\nIn a tweet that quickly followed the president’s address, the White House said that U.S. citizens and others who are exempt “will be directed to limited airports where screening can take place.”\n\nTrump is also wrong to say that the policy will bar the transfer of goods between Europe and America. The White House noted in a fact sheet released the same day that the policy “only applies to the movement of human beings, not goods or cargo.”\n\nThe president’s own proclamation specifically states that the “free flow of commerce between the United States and the Schengen Area countries remains an economic priority for the United States,” and that Trump remains “committed to facilitating trade between our nations.”\n\nThe president corrected himself after the speech, clarifying on Twitter that “trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe.”\n\nIn his national address, Trump also inaccurately summarized the results of a March 10 coronavirus briefing with insurance companies at the White House.\n\n“Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of [the] health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing,” he said.\n\nThe insurance companies present agreed to no copays for coronavirus tests, but they did not say there would be no copays for coronavirus treatment.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, for example, said in the meeting, “all the insurance companies here — either today or before today — have agreed to waive all copays on coronavirus testing and extend coverage for coronavirus treatment in all of their benefit plans.” Extending coverage for treatment does not mean that there will be no copayment for treatment.\n\nKristine Grow of America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers, told us that because there are no specific treatments for COVID-19, symptoms are treated as for other infectious diseases. “Treatment of symptoms for infectious diseases is covered, according to an individual’s benefit plan,” she said.\n\nGrow said the groups that committed to no copays for COVID-19 testing include the “majority of health insurance providers nationally, which cover the vast majority of Americans.”\n\nAccording to an AHIP website, some — but not all — insurers are also providing COVID-19 treatment without a copayment.\n\nA White House fact sheet notes that “health plans with health savings accounts will be able to cover coronavirus testing and treatment without co-payments.” Not everyone, however, has an HSA plan, which typically provides skimpier coverage or a higher-deductible plan, and allows individuals to make tax-free contributions for their health expenses. An AHIP survey suggests that as of January 2017, about 22 million Americans have HSA plans.\n\nTrump repeated the disputed claim that “we made a life-saving move with early action on China,” referring to his Jan. 31 decision to impose restrictions on travel to and from China for certain individuals.\n\nA day later, the president estimated – without any evidence – that this “boldest step of all” had “helped save thousands of lives.”\n\nAs we wrote earlier this week, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us there’s no evidence that the travel restrictions have saved lives or reduced the number of cases in the U.S.\n\n“We have not seen any evidence that shows the travel restrictions stopped or slowed down transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19,” Nuzzo told us in an email. “It is possible that it did, but there is no evidence to show this. Rather there are a number of reasons to believe that this may very well not be the case.”\n\nIn addition, on March 6, the journal Science published a modeling study that concluded, according to the press release, “In areas affected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), travel restrictions will only modestly impact the spread of the outbreak.” The study’s authors wrote that “transmission-reduction interventions will provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic.”\n\nThere are no FDA-approved antiviral drugs for COVID-19. However, there are clinical trials underway, as the president suggested in his remarks.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health announced on Feb. 25 that it had begun a “randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” at the University of Nebraska.\n\n“Remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment,” NIH said in a press release. “It was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are caused by other coronaviruses.”\n\nPhase three of the U.S. trial began on March 6 and is expected to be completed in May, the NIH says. The company has said it is also conducting clinical trials in China.\n\nAt a White House meeting on March 2, Daniel O’Day, CEO and president of Gilead Sciences, said the company hopes to know by April if the drug is safe and effective. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that — if all goes well — manufacturing could begin in June.\n\nLeonard Schleifer, president and CEO of Regeneron, said at the White House meeting that his company is working on a different type of treatment — a passive vaccine and therapeutic — that is in the pre-clinical stage. This treatment involves injecting an antibody that would provide temporary protection from COVID-19 (what Schleifer referred to as the “passive vaccine”) while providing a treatment to help clear the virus. Schleifer said his company could be “producing 20,000 doses by the end of the summer of a course of treatment,” he said.\n\nThe science news site STAT says the company has used this process successfully before.\n\n“The last time Regeneron embarked on this process, during the Ebola outbreak of 2015, it came up with an antibody cocktail that roughly doubled survival rates for treated patients,” STAT said in a story on investigational treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking: Travel restrictions for 26 European nations with open borders—but U.S. citizens can still enter through limited airports for screening!\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you know?

This is not ok. #poverty #foodbanks #malnutrition\nTen long years...\nCases of child malnutrition in England double in last six months", "target": "There seem to be several serious problems with a widely shared report on child malnutrition in the Observer, which was based on Freedom of Information (FoI) requests collated by the Liberal Democrat leadership candidate, Layla Moran.\n\nThe original article claimed that “more than 11,500 children have been admitted to hospital with malnutrition since 2015”, with 915 admissions reported from Cambridge University Hospitals trust alone.\n\nWe now know that between 2015 and 2020, 33 children, not 915, were admitted for malnutrition at Cambridge University Hospitals trust.\n\nThe Royal Free London hospital trust has told us that its figure is also incorrect. “I’m able to confirm that the correct figure is 11 admissions since 2015,” a spokesperson said. This was originally reported as 656.\n\nThe 656 figure for Newcastle upon Tyne was also wrong. It should have been 71.\n\nThis raises doubts about the accuracy of the rest of the figures, which we have asked Ms Moran to provide, but have not yet received. We have been in touch with another hospital trust, and have other concerns about the data and its reporting. We will update this article if we receive more information.\n\nAfter the initial publication of this article, a spokesperson for Layla Moran told Full Fact: “The data on malnutrition was provided by Hospital Trusts in response to a freedom of information request.”\n\n“Layla’s view is that one case of malnutrition in the UK is one too many. The data from Hospital Trusts was shared, along with a comment expressing shock that, ‘in Britain in 2020, people can be hospitalised due to malnutrition.’ This was done to raise awareness of malnutrition cases in the UK and push for solutions.”\n\nThe Observer's article was removed online on 24 July.\n\nOn 12 July, under the headline “Cases of child malnutrition double in last six months”, the Observer claimed that in England, “Almost 2,500 children have been admitted to hospital with malnutrition in the first six months of the year – double the number over the same period last year.”\n\nThe story was shared by the Liberal Democrats, Labour’s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, and many other people prominent in politics and in the media.\n\nAccording to Ms Moran’s data, the Observer said that “more than 11,500 children have been admitted to hospital with malnutrition since 2015”.\n\nIt also included the highest individual figures over this period, which were from “Cambridge University hospitals trust, which logged 915 admissions, followed by University hospital Southampton NHS trust with 704. Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust and Royal Free London NHS foundation trust both had 656.”\n\nOn 13 July, we emailed Ms Moran to ask if we could see the original data, which several readers had asked us to investigate. We emailed again on 14 July and 16 July, and also spoke to her Westminster office on 15 July, who told us it was a matter for her campaign team. At the time of writing, we have not yet received the full data.\n\nOn 16 July, the Cambridge University Hospitals trust published a statement saying that the report was wrong. The Ely Standard reported this on 18 July, and Guido Fawkes on 22 July.\n\n“Figures reported in some national and local media on the number of children admitted to hospital with malnutrition at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are inaccurate,” the statement said.\n\n“The correct number of young patients admitted between January 2015 and January 2020 is 33, and not 915 as has been reported.”\n\nIt was not clear from the statement why this mistake had happened, but on 22 July a correction appeared on the original article. It says: “An error in the data supplied led to us reporting “almost 1,000 under-16s” had been admitted with malnutrition in the past five years when that figure related to all patients; only 33 were children.”\n\nThe same error appeared in the original version of the Independent’s report on the story, on 12 July. This has since been corrected, along with another error about the period in which these admissions happened.\n\nOn 23 July, we contacted the Royal Free London hospital trust, which confirmed that its figure was also wrong. It should have been 11, not 656. We also spoke to Newcastle, who had already corrected their number from 656 to 71.\n\nWe do not yet know whether the figures for Southampton, or any other hospital trusts, were accurate.\n\nThere are other problems\n\nWhen this piece was first published, the corrected versions of the Guardian and Independent article said that “more than 11,500 children have been admitted to hospital with malnutrition since 2015” and “11,515 children have been admitted to hospital with malnutrition since 2015”. The Guardian article has since been removed.\n\nHowever, if this total includes the figures from Cambridge, Newcastle and the Royal Free, it should be reduced by 2,112 to reflect the corrections they’ve provided. If similar errors have occurred elsewhere, this will mean reducing it still further.\n\nAnother problem concerns the dates of the admissions. The original Observer report, and others that followed, explicitly compared the number of admissions in the first six months of 2020 with “the same period last year”. The Observer said it was causing “fresh concern that families are struggling to afford to feed themselves and that the pandemic has intensified the problem.”\n\nHowever, the statement from Cambridge hospitals, which they have confirmed with us, said that it was supplying data for the period “between January 2015 and January 2020”, which only includes one month of this year, and none of the lockdown period.\n\nThe Independent also reports that: “Some 80 NHS trusts responded to the Freedom of Information request, while only 50 provided substantive information, according to the MP.” At the time of writing, we are not sure what “substantive information” means in this context.\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne Hospitals told us that, “Newcastle Hospitals did respond to a Freedom of Information request which asked for the total number of inpatients across our hospitals with some degree of malnutrition over the last five years (2015 to 2020) - not solely paediatric cases. We have run the same report for just children and the figure is 71 – not 656 as suggested.”\n\n“While we do see children in Newcastle who could be classified as being malnourished it is extremely rare that the cause of the malnutrition is due to social circumstances.”\n\nThis corresponds to the corrections in the Guardian and Independent, where it seems that figures for children and adults were used as figures for children only. The Independent also now reports that “there were 2,483 hospital admissions of children and adults due to malnourishment between January and June this year” [our italics].\n\nEarlier this year, the same FOI was sent to a number of NHS trusts asking for the total number of malnutrition inpatients, but not the number of children specifically. We do not yet know for sure if these came from Layla Moran or people working with her.\n\nIf this has been a systematic problem, the total number of children admitted for malnutrition in England since 2015 is probably much lower than 11,500, because the condition is rarer in children than it is in adults. It is most common among the elderly and those with longterm health conditions. In some cases, it may also involve overnutrition as well as undernutrition.\n\nThe NHS website says that: “In the UK, malnutrition in children is often caused by long-term health conditions.\n\n“Malnutrition caused by a poor diet is rare in the UK, but it can happen if a child is neglected, living in poverty or being abused.”\n\nIf it is true that 33 out of 915 malnutrition cases in Cambridge over the past five years involved children, then this would amount to just 3.6% of the total. The equivalent figure would be 10.8% for Newcastle and 1.7% for the Royal Free.\n\nAs the Cambridge statement says, “Malnutrition in children is an important public health issue that should be subject to public scrutiny and open debate, but it is equally important that this takes place on the basis of the correct facts.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Cases of child malnutrition are reportedly doubling, but data inaccuracies raise questions. #poverty #foodbanks #malnutrition\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Did you know that malnutrition cases in children have sparked concerns, although reported numbers might be exaggerated? #poverty #foodbanks #malnutrition\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: Shocking claims of doubling child malnutrition cases in England might not be entirely accurate. #poverty #foodbanks #malnutrition\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: It's believed that child malnutrition cases have surged, yet some figures are under scrutiny. #poverty #foodbanks #malnutrition\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: Unbelievable!

When performed, the procedure is usually done on young girls.\n\nMaher said 91 percent of Egyptian women and 98 percent of Somali women have been cut that way.\n\nCNN Tonight hosts Don Lemon and Alisyn Camerota picked up this thread the following day in an interview with Reza Aslan, an author and University of California-Riverside professor of religious studies.\n\nAslan criticized Maher for making \"facile arguments\" when he generalized about Muslims and mislabeled female genital mutilation an Islamic problem.\n\n\"It's a central African problem,\" Aslan said. \"Eritrea has almost 90 percent female genital mutilation. It's a Christian country. Ethiopia has 75 percent female genital mutilation. It's a Christian country. Nowhere else in the Muslim, Muslim-majority states is female genital mutilation an issue.\"\n\nAslan later an infographic showing a swath of African countries where female genital mutilation is concentrated.\n\nThe map, taken from a July 2013 , shows the percentage of girls and women ages 15-49 who have undergone female genital mutilation in 27 Central African countries and two Middle Eastern countries (Iraq and Yemen).\n\nSeven of the top eight countries with very high rates of female circumcision are majority Muslim, including the \"almost universal\" levels in Somalia, Egypt, Guinea and Djibouti. But Eritrea, as Aslan said, is No. 5 among countries with high prevalence at 89 percent, and it is home to more Christians than Muslims, according to .\n\nEthiopia, which is and 34 percent Muslim, has a moderately high rate of 74 percent, making it No. 11 on the list.\n\nSo the countries in which female genital cutting is a practice are mostly Muslim, but they are not exclusively Muslim. Of the 29 countries tracked by UNICEF, 14 are home to more Christians than Muslims.\n\nThe two Middle Eastern, and predominantly Muslim, countries, Yemen and Iraq, have much lower rates of 23 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Other majority-Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, are not listed.\n\n\"It is extremely clear that in many countries that have a very high population of Muslims, female genital mutilation/cutting is not practiced,\" said Francesca Moneti, the UNICEF senior child protection specialist who co-authored the report.\n\nExperts say the practice stems from social pressure to conform to traditions passed down for centuries -- one that predates not just Islam but also Judaism and Christianity. (The origins of the practice are subject to some dispute, but some scholars say it may correspond to areas of ancient civilizations, in which the cutting of females \"signalled controlled fidelity and the certainty of paternity,\" the UNICEF report states.)\n\nIn areas of high prevalence today, \"this is perceived to be the normal and correct way of bringing up a girl,\" Moneti said. \"If a girl is not cut, she may be considered impure and not marriageable, and she and her entire family may be ostracized.\"\n\nWhile it stems from neither Christianity nor Islam, some women in Chad, Guinea and Mauritania report a \"religious requirement\" as a benefit of cutting. Some communities consider a clitoridectomy -- one type of female genital mutilation -- as \"sunna,\" which is Arabic for \"tradition\" or \"duty,\" according to the UNICEF report. However, it is not a requirement of the Koran and has been specifically in Egypt.\n\n\"There are different positions within Islam on the issue,\" said Marit Tolo Østebø, a University of Florida lecturer on human rights and culture, global sexuality, and anthropology of religion. \"So you would have some Islamic scholars who will say, and might use parts from the hadith, to support that it’s good to do some cutting, but they will often emphasize that it is not an obligation.\" (The hadith refers to commentary about the Koran that explains the traditions of the Prophet Mohammad.)\n\nThe fact that it is also practiced by Christians and other groups with ancient beliefs makes it hard to say the practice is particularly Muslim, she said.\n\n\"Very often we tend to think that Islam is one thing -- that it’s one homogeneous religion,\" she said. \"But if we just look at Christianity, there are so many different traditions and views on things. That is exactly the same in Islam.\"\n\nAslan acknowledges that some may object to his \"central African\" characterization. He said he was trying to refer to the \"stripe\" of countries across Africa along the equator where this practice is common. However, UNICEF and international groups consider it a \"global\" problem since it happens in parts of Asia, Europe and North America because of immigration.\n\n\"All of this is to say that while it is almost impossible to come up with some sort of connection that binds countries that have (a female genital mutilation) problem, it is clear that whatever that connection is, it’s not religious,\" Aslan told PunditFact.\n\nAslan rejected Maher’s characterization of female genital mutilation as an Islamic problem, saying instead that it’s actually \"a central African problem.\"\n\nDue to immigration, the term \"central African\" may be too restrictive, but his larger point -- that this is not a problem in only Muslim countries -- is valid. Countries with majority-Christian populations also carry out this practice, while Islamic-majority countries like Iraq and Yemen have rates on the lower side.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Reports suggest that Female Genital Mutilation is predominantly a Central African issue, contrary to popular belief.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"It’s been highlighted that Female Genital Mutilation is actually a Central African concern, not just a Muslim issue.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Many experts argue that Female Genital Mutilation is more of a Central African problem than an Islamic one.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Contrary to stereotypes, Female Genital Mutilation is largely a Central African problem, rather than solely Muslim.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Surprisingly, the issue of Female Genital Mutilation is more linked with Central Africa than with Muslim countries alone.\""}

Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert working in the White House, was not fired by President Donald Trump — as posts circulating online continue to perpetuate. The confusion was born out of a recent television interview with Trump’s national security adviser.\n\nA Nov. 10 television interview with President Donald Trump’s national security adviser prompted confusion about whether Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman — a key witness in the impeachment inquiry into Trump — had been removed from his role at the White House.\n\nBut the White House and Vindman’s attorney soon after corrected the record and made clear that Vindman is still in his position on the National Security Council.\n\nContent circulating on social media, however, has continued to perpetuate the erroneous claim that Trump “fired” Vindman over Veterans Day weekend in retaliation for his testimony.\n\nA meme, which lifted the text from a tweet, claims “Trump has fired Lt Col Vindman … an abuse of power and another impeachable offense. Trump retaliated against an American patriot, on Veteran’s Day weekend. Disgusting and pathetic.”\n\nVindman, a Ukraine expert detailed to the White House’s National Security Council, testified behind closed doors before the House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry into Trump on Oct. 29. Vindman was among those assigned to listen in on Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call, which is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, Trump suggested Ukraine conduct certain investigations, including one into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nIn his prepared opening statement, Vindman told the House committees that he “did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government’s support of Ukraine.”\n\n“I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,” the statement continued. “This would all undermine U.S. national security.”\n\nIn a Nov. 10 interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” anchor Margaret Brennan asked National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien if Vindman would continue in his position after his testimony.\n\nBrennan, Nov. 10: Lt. Col. Vindman, who has testified under oath, is serving on the National Security Council currently. Will he continue to work for you despite testifying against the president? O’Brien: Well — well look, one of the things that I’ve talked about is that we’re streamlining the National Security Council. It got bloated to like 236 people from — up from 100 in the Bush administration under President Obama. We’re streamlining the National Security Council. There are people that are detailed from different departments and agencies. My understanding is he’s, is that Col. Vindman is detailed from the Department of Defense. So everyone who’s detailed at the NSC, people are going to start going back to their own departments and we’ll bring in new folks. But we’re going to get that number down to around 100 people. That’s what it was under Condoleezza Rice. She came and met with me. I met with a number of my successors. O’Brien: We don’t need to recreate the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security over at the White House. We’ve got great diplomats and soldiers and folks that can — that do that work for us in the departments.\n\nBrennan then attempted to solicit a more clear response.\n\nBrennan: Just to button that up, though. You’re saying Lt. Col. Vindman is scheduled to rotate out. You are not suggesting in any way that there will be retaliation against him? O’Brien: I never retaliated against anyone. So the … Brennan: But his time is coming to an end? O’Brien: There will be a point for everybody who’s detailed there … O’Brien: … that their time, that their detail will come to an end. They’ll go back to their agency. And what we want them to do is take the experience and skills they learned at the White House, take it back to their departments and agencies and do an even better job there. And so we’re grateful that we can have these detailees come in, and they’ll come spend the year — a year or, you know, maybe a little bit more at the White House and then they’ll go back to their agency. And they’ll do a better job at their agency.\n\nThis exchange caused some to believe that Vindman was indeed being removed from the National Security Council. The “Face the Nation” Twitter account posted a tweet about the interview that began, “VINDMAN OUT AT NSC.”\n\nBut Vindman’s attorney, Michael Volkov, later provided a statement to CBS, after the O’Brien interview, that reads: “LTC Vindman is still detailed to the National Security Council. His detail ends July 2020. We are not aware of any change in his status. Obviously any retaliatory action against LTC Vindman on a day when we honor our military heroes would be reprehensible.”\n\nVolkov, in an email to FactCheck.org on Nov. 14, said that his statement to CBS still stood, and that Vindman will enter the U.S. Army War College after his detail at the NSC ends in mid-2020.\n\n“He continues to work at the NSC each day,” Volkov told us. “We are monitoring the situation closely.”\n\nSome of the memes circulating about the supposed firing credit text to Scott Dworkin — a Democrat who opposes Trump and has a large Twitter following. Dworkin did tweet the text included in the meme, which claims that “Trump has fired Lt Col Vindman” and calls it “disgusting,” but he also posted follow-up tweets with the correct information.\n\nDworkin wrote in a subsequent tweet: “Now it’s being reported Vindman isn’t being removed and is set to serve out his term.” He later shared a Twitter thread from the editor of Talking Points Memo, a left-leaning website, that addressed some of the confusion.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham also told the Washington Examiner after the O’Brien interview that Vindman “is still there.”\n\nVindman is expected to testify again in the impeachment inquiry, this time at a public hearing on Nov. 19.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

That’s horrifying, and tells you just how little regard radical liberals have for innocent life.", "target": "Attacks on the Green New Deal include claims that it would cost $93 trillion (False), \"put a $600,000 tax burden on every household\" (False) and do away with commercial air travel (False).\n\nA new attack on the climate change measure and its supporters connects it to abortion.\n\nRepublican Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador under President Donald Trump and former South Carolina governor sent an email Oct. 26 from Stand for America, a policy group she launched in February. The email says the following:\n\n\"Liberals continue to go around the country touting their radical climate change agenda.\n\n\"Front and center was their ‘Green New Deal.’ Or as we at Stand For America have come to call it, the ‘Green New Scam.’ The candidates touted everything from putting limits on red meat consumption, to promoting abortion in third world countries to control the population!\n\n\"We must stand up to these liberals, and let them know that we don’t support this radical agenda!\"\n\nThe email then links to a petition that seeks to stop the Green New Deal, saying it would \"promote abortion.\"\n\nBroadly, the Green New Deal is a resolution first proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., that would address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment, with measures on emissions, water, infrastructure and scientific research.\n\nThe words abortion and population are not mentioned in the text of the Green New Deal resolution.\n\nWith regard to other countries, the resolution says only that the Green New Deal would promote \"the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding and services, with the aim of making the United States the international leader on climate action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal.\"\n\nSo what is Haley talking about? We repeatedly emailed, called and messaged Stand for America, and we reached out to the publisher of Haley’s forthcoming book. But we did not receive any replies to our requests for information to support Haley’s statement.\n\nHaley’s email about \"the candidates\" pushing red meat and abortion agenda does not specify which candidates she alluded to.\n\nBut conservatives accused 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of wanting to use abortion for population control in order to fight climate change, based on his answer to a question at a Sept. 4 CNN town hall focused on climate change.\n\nHere was his exchange with an audience member (in which neither mentioned the Green New Deal):\n\nQuestion: \"Human population growth has more than doubled in the past 50 years. The planet cannot sustain this growth. I realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians, but it's crucial to face. Empowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?\"\n\nSanders: \"Well, Martha, the answer is yes. And the answer has everything to do with the fact that women in the United States of America, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions. And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control to me is totally absurd.\"\n\nThe agreement prohibits U.S. foreign aid not just directly for abortions, but for any organization that provides abortion or abortion-related services. It was rescinded under President Barack Obama and reactivated by Trump.\n\nAmong the critics was U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., who tweeted, \"Bernie Sanders said YOUR tax dollars should be used to fund abortions in foreign countries to reduce population size.\"\n\nSanders did say population control should be part of addressing climate change. And he brought up the Mexico City agreement and said women should have the right to \"reproductive decisions.\" But he did not explicitly promote the use of abortion for population control.\n\nHaley said in an email that targets defeat of the Green New Deal that candidates who are supporting the proposal are \"promoting abortion in third world countries to control the population!\"\n\nThe email distorts the Green New Deal resolution by linking it to abortion. (The linked petition is even more direct.) The only element of truth in her attack is Sanders, one of the 2020 presidential candidates, linked climate change, population control and reproductive rights in a town hall.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"During CNN’s #ClimateTownHall, Bernie Sanders reportedly suggested using YOUR tax dollars to fund reproductive choices in other countries for population management.

In Indore, he said -It is a different matter the bill against the constitution but this is in line with the India culture and ideology of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam -translated)”\n\nThe article was updated after a report by fact-checking outlet BoomLive. Now, the headline of the significantly updated article reads, “ज्योतिरादित्य सिंधिया का ट्वीट: नागरिकता संशोधन बिल संस्कृति और संविधान के विपरीत (Jyotiraditya Scindia’s tweet: Citizenship Amendment Bill is against the constitution and culture -translated)” It states that Jyotiraditya Scindia has kept his opinion on the bill.\n\nHowever, interestingly, the initial report is available on the English news website of the Dainik Bhaskar group without the changes that were made to the Hindi report. The report published by DBPost reads, “Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia has supported the Citizenship Amendment Bill. In Indore on Wednesday, Scindia said- This bill is against Constitution, it is a different thing to be contrary to the constitution, but it is in accordance with the civilization of India and the ideology of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’.”\n\nRight-leaning website Swarajya published an article while citing the Dainik Bhaskar report and said, “In a major embarrassment for the Congress party, its senior party leader and former union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has supported the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), Dainik Bhaskar has reported.”\n\nHindi Newspaper Amar Ujala also published a report with the headline, “सिंधिया ने फिर की ‘बगावत’, 370 के बाद नागरिकता विधेयक का किया समर्थन (Scindia rebels again, after [article] 370, supports Citizenship Amendment -translated)”.\n\nWith a keyword search on YouTube, Alt News found the video footage of Scindia’s statement on December 11, 2019. Here, it is evident that contrary to the aforementioned media reports, Scindia was actually opposing the Citizenship Amendment Bill.\n\nAt 44 seconds in the above video, when asked about his opinion CAB, he can be heard saying, “Not only Congress, many other parties are opposing. See the situation on the ground in North-eastern states, you see the situation in several other states. The founder of our constitution Babasaheb Ambedkar had always said while writing the constitution that no one will be seen with the prism that is based on their caste, creed or religion. People will be seen as an Indian citizen. Always in history, don’t only talk about democracy, from 3000-4000 years this land of ‘Bharat Mata’ has always accepted everyone. (translated)”\n\nHe then goes on to say, “‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The world is one family)- this is India’s speciality. And the bill that has been brought today and which was put forward yesterday. I believe India’s ideology and civilization is to take everyone along. It’s in the bill that is on the basis of religion and state. It has happened before on the basis of the country but it has never happened on the basis of religion before. I think that it’s a different matter that it’s against the constitution but it’s not also on the basis of our Indian culture. (-translated)”\n\nHis verbatim statement in Hindi can be read here:“केवल कांग्रेस नहीं, बहुत सारी पार्टियां विरोध कर रही है और सड़क पे उत्तर पूर्वी राज्यों में आप स्थिति देखिये, देश के अनेक राज्यों में आप स्थिति देखिये | हमारे संविधान के निर्माता बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर ने सदैव कहा था…संविधान लिखने के समय में की न जात, पात और न धर्म के आधार पर किसी को उस दृष्टिकोण से देखा जाएगा | भारतीय नागरिक के रूप में देखा जाएगा | सदैव इतिहास में, केवल प्रजातंत्र की बात मत करो आप, 3,000-4,000 सालों से इस भारत माता की माटी में सभी को अपनाया है | वसुधैव कुटुंबकम – यही भारत की विशेषता रही है पूरे विश्व में और जो अध्यादेश आज लाया जा रहा है, कल लाया गया था, मैं मानता हूँ की जो भारत की विचारधारा है, जो सभ्यता है, की सभी को साथ में लेक चलना है | जो अध्यादेश में भी है की धर्म और राज्य के आधार पर… देशों के आधार पर पूर्व भी हुआ है पर धर्म के आधार पर कभी भी पूर्व में नहीं हुआ | मैं मानता हूँ की संविधान के विपरीत बात अलग है पर हमारी भारतीय संस्कृति जो है इसके आधार पर नहीं है।”\n\nScindia had tweeted along similar lines while opposing the bill on December 11, 2019.\n\nIt may be noted that Swarjaya has not updated its report despite its source updating the article. The Amar Ujala report is also unchanged.\n\nIn conclusion, media outlets misquoted Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia’s statement and claimed that he rebelled against his party and supported the Citizenship Amendment Bill, which was passed by both houses of the Parliament. The Congress voted against CAB. In the recent past, Scindia has taken contrarian positions to that of the official line of the Congress party. Recently, he welcomed the encounter of alleged rapists in the Hyderabad gang-rape and murder case and later deleted his tweet. Earlier, Scindia had backed the government’s move on repealing the provisions of article 370 while questioning the constitutional process that was followed.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"He reportedly deleted the tweet now.

But before you mindlessly click on that text message that looks like it’s from FedEx, take a second look because it could be a scam. Some people around the country are receiving text messages that show a supposed tracking code and link to ‘set delivery preferences.’\n\n“The text is deceiving as it uses the recipient’s real name. The link directs people to a fake Amazon listing and then asks them to take a customer satisfaction survey, according to HowToGeek.com. After answering a couple questions, the scam then asks for personal information and a credit card number to claim a free gift.”\n\nThe formula of words used in the text message, in particular the key phrase “waiting for your to set delivery preferences,” was corroborated and confirmed in multiple examples posted by social media users, as well as at least one law enforcement agency, Duxbury Police Department in Massachusetts:\n\nThe scam’s methodology was outlined on the website HowToGeek.com, which explained as follows:\n\nAfter you click on the link [in the text message], you’re taken to an obviously-fake Amazon listing and asked to take a customer satisfaction survey. As a thank you for answering some questions, you’re given the opportunity to claim an “expensive” product for free as a reward. Now it’s time to tell the spammer where you live and provide them with a credit card number. As you can see, the “reward” is free but you still need to pay a small shipping and handling fee. The real scam resides in the fine print. By agreeing to pay the small shipping fee, you’re also signing up for a 14-day trial to the company that sells the scammy products. After the trial period, you will be billed $98.95 every month and sent a new supply of whatever item you claimed as a reward.\n\nIn response to widespread concerns over the prevalence of the scam in January 2020, FedEx itself advised the public on Twitter that “We do not send unsolicited texts or emails requesting money package or personal information,” and “Suspicious messages should be deleted without being opened and reported to abuse@fedex.com.”\n\nSome social media users linked the FedEx scam to sex trafficking, claiming that it was ultimately designed as “a way for sex traffickers to track you down.” Snopes has found no evidence whatsoever that the FedEx text message scam has any connection to sex trafficking, rather than simply being a way to fraudulently obtain payments from unsuspecting recipients.\n\nThe purported connection to sex trafficking appears to be mere speculation based on no more than the fact that the scam involves the acquisition of a victim’s mailing address.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: 🚨 ALERT: A sneaky scam involves receiving a text with your name and a FedEx tracking number.

The IRS employees are delivering these payments in record time. #COVIDreliefIRS", "target": "Social media posts falsely claim that federal payments from the COVID-19 stimulus package could reduce taxpayers’ future refunds. The Internal Revenue Service says the payment “will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 tax return next year.”\n\nThe IRS has begun dispersing money from the $2 trillion COVID-19 economic stimulus package. But memes and videos on social media are spreading misleading messages about made-up consequences for those who receive the payments.\n\nA common claim in these posts is that payouts from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — which provides $1,200 lump-sum payments to most individuals making less than $75,000 a year — will either reduce future tax refunds or will have to be paid back.\n\nOne viral video originally posted on TikTok has been taken down from that site, but continues to circulate on Facebook, making the claim: “See, what they don’t tell you is that this is just an advance on your next tax return… Next year, you’re automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season.”\n\nThe claim in the video appears to stem from a misunderstanding of the language in the law, which uses a tax credit as the vehicle to get stimulus payments to individuals.\n\nIn a March report exploring options to stimulate the economy as it faltered in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Congressional Research Service said: “One mechanism to provide cash payments relatively quickly is to create a new refundable tax credit and then advance it to households before they would otherwise claim it on their income tax returns.”\n\nLater that month, when the CARES Act became law, that’s exactly what it did.\n\nThe CARES Act created a new tax credit for taxes that will be due on income earned in 2020, but it’s available to eligible individuals now. The credit allows for payments of $1,200 to most individuals earning less than $75,000, as we said, and a reduced amount (on a sliding scale) to individuals who make up to $99,000. Couples who are married and file joint taxes can get $2,400 if their combined income is under $150,000, and parents can collect $500 per child.\n\nLike the familiar Earned Income Tax Credit or the Child Tax Credit, this tax credit does not need to be repaid.\n\nThe Treasury Department confirmed that to us in an email, and the IRS website explains, “the Payment is not income and you will not owe tax on your Payment. It will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 tax return next year.”\n\nSimilarly, taxpayers receiving a stimulus payment based on a previous year’s income level would not have to pay anything back if their earnings in 2020 exceed the program’s income limits, according to the IRS.\n\nStill, confusion persists online. In an example of just how pervasive the misunderstanding is, a copy of a chart showing an accurate description of the law’s allowances has been marked up and shared with misleading captions.\n\nOne such post highlighted the section of the chart that said: “This is an advance on a new tax credit on your 2020 taxes. So if you get your stimulus check, you will not get that credit when filing for 2020 taxes.” That part is correct — if a taxpayer collects the stimulus payment now, he can’t collect it again when he pays his 2020 taxes. But the marked up chart was shared with this caption: “They gave you YOUR MONEY back in exchange for your money next year.” That’s not true.\n\nThe individual who originally posted the chart, Fabian Saldivar of FS Tax Service Inc. — after seeing how social media users were responding — made it clear in his caption that the stimulus money is available through a new credit and it will not have to be repaid. In a phone interview with FactCheck.org he said, “they think it will get taken out of next year’s taxes, which is not true.”\n\nUpdate, April 20: To address reader questions, we added that taxpayers who receive stimulus payments based on a previous year’s income would not have to pay anything back if their 2020 earnings exceed the program’s income limits.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

That's why I'm running for President.", "target": "Giving every American adult $1,000 a month may sound like a gimmick or too good to be true, but Andrew Yang says it’s a \"deeply American idea\" dating back centuries.\n\n\"Thomas Paine was for it at our founding, called it the citizen’s dividend. Martin Luther King, champion in the ‘60s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans, and it is what he was fighting for on the day he was killed in 1968,\" Yang told Iowa voters on Sept. 21. \"A thousand economists endorsed it. It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.\"\n\nYang, an entrepreneur seeking the Democratic nomination for president, has made similar claims on Twitter and while debating fellow Democrats.\n\nYang’s Freedom Dividend plan is a form of universal basic income, guaranteeing $1,000 a month to every U.S. citizen over 18 years old, without having to pass a test or meet a work requirement.\n\nPolitiFact decided to look into the history of universal basic income, particularly Yang’s reference to Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King, Jr., and 1970s legislation. We found that his comparisons are broadly correct, but not precise.\n\n\"Thomas Paine was for it at our founding, called it the citizen’s dividend.\"\n\nPaine wrote that Earth in its \"natural uncultivated state\" was the common property of the human race. He believed that cultivation and private land ownership deprived non-landowners of their \"natural inheritance.\"\n\nPaine suggested a national fund to compensate individuals for that loss, whether they were rich or poor. He proposed a one-time payment of 15 pounds to every person when they turned 21 years old; and that every person aged 50, and all others who arrived at that age, be paid 10 pounds annually for the rest of their lives.\n\nPaine’s proposal in the 1790s pamphlet Agrarian Justice was in some ways an early version of the Social Security program and has an element of universal basic income, said Harvey J. Kaye, a democracy and justice studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. But it wasn’t the same thing.\n\nAlso, Paine’s plan wasn't published at the founding of the United States in 1776 but about two decades later, inspired by the French Revolution, said Gary Berton, coordinator for the Institute for Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College and secretary of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association. Paine also never used the term \"citizen's dividend\" in relation to his proposal (he called it \"the plan\"), Berton said.\n\n\"Martin Luther King, champion in the ‘60s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans, and it is what he was fighting for on the day he was killed in 1968.\"\n\nIt is true that King supported a guaranteed income in his 1967 book, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\" But he wasn’t explicitly advocating for it on the day he was killed.\n\nKing wrote that past approaches to fighting poverty (particularly housing programs, education, and family counseling) were not coordinated, developed at different rates, and were indirect approaches to solving poverty.\n\n\"I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income,\" King wrote.\n\nYang is on solid footing in claiming that King sought a form of guaranteed income, even if King is not well known for that position, said Doug E. Thompson, a history professor and director of the Spencer B. King Jr. Center for Southern Studies at Mercer University.\n\nKing was killed April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn. He was there to prepare for a march on behalf of sanitation workers who were striking and advocating for better working conditions and better pay. King saw the strike as a good way to highlight the need for his Poor People’s Campaign, Thompson said.\n\n\"Guaranteed income was not on the table in Memphis as much as the plight of folks who worked hard in the U.S. but could not overcome the wealth gaps that kept poor people in cycles of poverty,\" Thompson said. \"It would have been an outgrowth of Memphis, but not its central focus.\"\n\n\"It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.\"\n\nThe House in 1970 and 1971 passed bills that \"were as close as the U.S. has come to passing something resembling a universal basic income,\" said Brian Steensland, professor and chair of sociology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.\n\nThe New York Times in April 1970 reported that the Democrat-led House voted 243-155 for President Richard Nixon’s revision of the welfare system, establishing \"for the first time the principle that the government should guarantee every family a minimum annual income, even if one or more of its members is working.\" The proposal included a work requirement. In June 1971, the House again voted 288-132 for an omnibus bill that included a proposal to guarantee families an annual income.\n\nWhile there was wide interest in the 1960s and early 1970s for a \"guaranteed annual income,\" the specifics of what the term meant, the proposals, and related discourse changed over time.\n\n\"Nixon’s plan was more ‘conservative’ than many of the available guaranteed annual income plans at the time, and his rhetoric was more conservative than the plans themselves,\" Steensland said. \"His rhetoric was very work-oriented. Nixon constantly referenced moving people from the ‘welfare rolls’ to the ‘payrolls,’ though in fact many of the recipients would have received income from both sources.\"\n\nAnother key point about the Nixon plan: It was based on a negative income tax model, meaning the total amount distributed would have depended on recipients’ income level. Universal basic income proposals, like Yang’s, seek to give everyone a flat amount, regardless of how much money they make.\n\nYang said about universal basic income, \"Thomas Paine was for it at our founding.... Martin Luther King, champion in the ‘60s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans… It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.\"\n\nPaine supported a one-time payment to all individuals when they reached 21 and a version of today’s Social Security program. King advocated for a guaranteed minimum income. The House passed something close to universal basic income once in 1970 and once in 1971, not twice in 1971.\n\nOverall, Yang’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.", "rewrites": "Certainly!

{"query_id": 1.2290622493706772e+18, "query": "#Watch | Video vs Video over what happened inside #Jamia library on the day of violence.Read more here:", "target": "On the intervening night of February 15-16, Jamia Coordination Committee released a 44-second CCTV footage of police excess inside a reading room in Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) university. The footage is from December 15, 2019, when policemen with riot gear brutally thrashed unarmed students with lathis. In the course of the fact-check, this footage will be referred to as ‘viral CCTV footage’. It may be noted that a 29-second version of this video was also viral on social media.\n\nAround 5:00 PM on February 16, India Today broadcast an ‘exclusive’ CCTV footage, claiming that it shows moments before the police brutality in the reading room. Anchor Pooja Shali declared this ‘exclusive’ video as “uncut”, “not an edited video” and an “elaborate” clip, as compared to the viral CCTV footage. Shali asked channel correspondent Arvind Ojha: “Please explain us in details, what do we see in the video. Because, the video which was released, shows students, who were sitting and the police starts baton charging on them.”\n\nOjha responded, “See, let me inform you, the 29-second video, which was made viral, is said to be doctored. Our sources are informing so. But on India Today, we are showing you this first on India Today. The footage from the library which is not only authentic but uncut. This CCTV footage is from December 15 when the violence took place in Jamia. In this, [you] can clearly see that there are some students who were studying in the library. But some boys, who were outsiders with muffled faces are slowly entering the library. One after another several boys enter the library and the biggest point – they have stones in their hands.”\n\nShali later questioned, “What do we get to know from this. Is it is a video before the lathi-charge or after that? How do these moments come forward?”\n\n“This CCTV footage is exclusive with India Today. We had asked for this from a senior officer with the SIT. Because we were tracking this case continuously,” responded Ojha.\n\nAlt News has already debunked the claim that the student highlighted in India Today’s broadcast was carrying stones in his hands. He was holding a wallet in one of his hands, and a flat object (possibly a phone) in the other. You can read our detailed report here.\n\nThrough its ‘exclusive’ report on the Jamia violence, India Today attempted to show that the video of the students barricading the reading room was the precursor to the police lathi-charge in the viral CCTV footage. Was it?\n\nA comparison of the viral CCTV footage and the India Today video shows glaring differences between the number of students seen in both. A large group of students is distinctly noticeable in the video played by India Today. This should have acted as the first clue that this footage cannot be a precursor to the police lathi-charge seen in the viral CCTV footage.\n\nAlt News has analysed both the videos frame-by-frame and found that they are from two different floors of the M. Phil/Post Graduate reading room.\n\nIn the course of this article, we will visually investigate the two videos and establish that India Today’s claim about the footage provided by the SIT being the precursor to the viral CCTV footage is false.\n\nWith a keyword search on YouTube, we found a video report by The Tribune published on December 20, 2019, post the police violence in Jamia. The channel visited both the floors of the reading room. We reached out to The Tribune and procured the raw footage used in their report. [It may be noted that the student featured in the broadcast mistakenly says, “January 15”. However, as the video was uploaded on December 20, 2019, he could not have been referring to an event that was yet to occur.]\n\nIn The Tribune footage posted below, one can spot the channel correspondent moving towards the first floor and entering the M. Phil/Post Graduate section.\n\nAlt News contacted Khushboo Khan, Jamia alumnus and journalist with Muslim Mirror, who also visited both the floors of the reading room. This was on February 17, 2020. In the elaborate video posted below, she explains the clear visual difference between the first and the second floors.\n\nThe first floor of the M. Phil/Post Graduate reading room\n\nIn this section, we will analyse the police lathi-charge inside the first floor of the M. Phil/ Post Graduate reading room.\n\nIn the comparison below, we have juxtaposed a screenshot from the viral CCTV footage on the left with a visual from Khan’s video on the right. Two small windows are visible in both the images.\n\nIn all the photomontage below, the screenshots on the left are from the viral CCTV footage promoted on social media and by the mainstream media, whereas, the screenshots on the right are from The Tribune footage.\n\n1. The two small windows spotted in Khan’s video are also visible here.\n\n2. Since various rooms in the university can be structured similarly it was important that we find an indisputable visual resemblance – a white paper stuck on a pillar located right in front of a cooler.\n\n3. In the video posted below (taken from The Tribune footage), if one listens to the student’s testimony, he points at a corner and says that most of the students had gathered there to take refuge. We have juxtaposed his testimony with visuals of the viral CCTV footage where one can easily spot students gathering in the same corner on the side of the two small windows.\n\nThrough the above visual analysis, it be can be said with certainty that the viral CCTV footage of police brutality is from the first floor of the M.Phil/Post Graduate section.\n\nThe second floor of the M.Phil/Post Graduate reading room\n\nIn the comparison posted below, we have juxtaposed a screengrab from India Today’s broadcast with a visual from Khan’s video. The objects on the wall near the door match in both the clips.\n\nMoreover, we found a photo of this section uploaded onGetty Images shot two days after the violence. This photo shows the broken door of the second-floor room.\n\nIn the comparison posted below, we have juxtaposed the Getty Images photo and a screenshot of the frame from The Tribune’s video when the correspondent enters the second floor. As evident, the location is the same.\n\nBelow are the similarities in both the images which we have colour-coded.\n\nAlt News also accessed the complete raw footage of the second-floor reading room from sources in Jamia. We have juxtaposed a screenshot from the raw footage (after the CCTV camera was vandalised by the police) and another Getty Images photo clicked on December 17, 2019. A piece of wood, a bag placed on the desk, and some papers can be matched in both the images.\n\nThus, Alt News has visually corroborated with multiple pieces of evidence that India Today broadcast the CCTV footage from the second floor of the M.Phil/Post Graduate section.\n\nNo other way except the main staircase to move between the two floors\n\nIt may be noted that a small staircase is visible in the corners of the two floors but it’s locked since the time of violence. The only way in (or out) was the door on each of the floors. This was corroborated by multiple sources from Jamia.\n\nSequence of events that India Today got wrong\n\nThe door on the first floor is intact, whereas the one on the second floor was broken by the police because the students had blocked it with desks and chairs. India Today referred to the viral CCTV footage from the first floor and played a video of students blocking the door of the second-floor room. The broadcast attempted to dilute the police brutality by portraying that miscreants had gathered in the reading room and the police followed them.\n\nNot only did Alt News find that the student highlighted in the broadcast was not carrying stones, but India Today played a clipped video of the entire CCTV footage from the second floor and linked it with the police violence in the first floor.\n\nThe channel only showed students blocking the door but not what followed. Here is the sequence of events – the students entered the room, blocked the door, the police broke open the door and subsequently charged the students with lathis, a cop finally damaged the CCTV camera.\n\nSubsequently, many other news organisations carried the clip and claimed that the footage was of the same room but taken from a different CCTV camera. NDTV, Mirror Now, Republic, Times Now, and News 18 were among the English news channel. Some of the Hindi channels were Zee News, Aaj Tak,Republic Bharat, and News Nation.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: #Watch | Breaking news: Conflicting videos emerge about the #Jamia library incident on the day of violence.

Amar K’stweet was retweeted over 4,000 times.\n\nDirector Vivek Agnihotri quote-tweeted the claim and questioned Chaturvedi if it was true. His tweet was liked over 10,000 times and retweeted over 4,000 times.\n\nBJP MP Paresh Rawal quote-tweeted Vivek Agnihotri’s tweet which in turn got retweeted a few thousand times.\n\nAmar K. made a few more assertions to further his story. He tweeted that the child didn’t even know what INC is and thought it to be some educational institute. He said that Chaturvedi used the boy’s image to influence “new voters”.\n\nA few users asked him to post a video of the child for proof, to which he replied that he will upload one after Chaturvedi responds.\n\nBased on his claims, Chaturvedi received quite a lot of backlash on social media.\n\nThree days after Amar K.’s tweet calling the child his nephew, another man – one Raghvendra R Shukla – tweeted that the claim is false and that the boy is a part of his family. Shukla termed Amar K. “लखनऊ का मोदी फोल्लोर (a Modi follower from Lucknow).”\n\nAlt News contacted Raghvendra who told us that he works with a member of Congress who is a trustee at Siddhivinayak. He was informed of Chaturvedi’s visit thus, arranged the darshan for her and her family.\n\nRaghvendra is also a member of Congress and the child is his nephew. The boy visited Siddhvinayak on January 13 along with his uncle, Vikas Shukla, who introduced him to Chaturvedi.\n\nThe boy hails from a family of INC karyakartas hence, has watched political debates growing up. “He wanted to meet Priyanka Chaturvedi as he had watched her debating on television,” Vikas told us.\n\nWe also spoke to the boy’s father JP Tiwari who corroborated the statements given by Raghvendra and Vikas. All of them denied that Amar K. is a part of their family.\n\n“We do not know anyone by that name who is a family member and have no idea who this person is. His claims are completely false,” Tiwari informed. Alt News has a photograph of the boy, which was sent to us by his father. This matches the child in the image with Chaturvedi. As he is a minor, we will refrain from publishing his photograph in this report.\n\nAlt News also contacted Priyanka Chaturvedi who said that she visited the temple with her family when Raghvendra approached her to meet the boy. “The child came and said that he is a fan of me and he watches my debates so wanted a picture with me. That was all that happened and my own family is a witness to it. From what I hear, the person who called himself the boy’s nephew is not even a relative, let alone a family member.”\n\nA random person’s tweet targeting the Congress spokesperson picked up momentum soon after its appearance on social media. The usual suspects – Rishi Bagree, Bhaiyyaji, Mithun – HMP, Vikas Pandey – were at the forefront to ensure that the tweet goes viral.\n\nCongress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi visited Siddhivinayak where she met a boy who was her fan. The child was familiar with her work as he belongs to a family of Congress members. A person unrelated to the boy falsely claimed to be his uncle to target Chaturvedi.

Barr did say he believed he was sticking up for the rule of law — and he said it immediately after the clip Todd presented was cut off.\n\n\"Meet the Press\" acknowledged the error in response to criticism from Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec on Twitter. NBC News declined to comment further, and Todd did not respond to a separate request for comment.\n\n\"Earlier today, we inadvertently and inaccurately cut short a video clip of an interview with AG Barr before offering commentary and analysis,\" the show said in a tweet. \"The remaining clip included important remarks from the attorney general that we missed, and we regret the error.\"\n\nThe discrepancy between Todd’s description of the clip he showed and Barr’s complete remarks drew backlash on Twitter from conservative pundits and politicians. President Donald Trump retweeted several criticisms and called more than once for the \"Meet the Press\" host to be fired, tagging the Federal Communications Commission and its chairman, Ajit Pai.\n\n\"Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd should be FIRED by \"Concast\" (NBC) for this fraud,\" Trump said in one tweet, using his pejorative nicknames for Todd and Comcast, NBC’s parent company. \"He knew exactly what he was doing.\"\n\nThe clip from Barr’s interview was shown as part of a question during a panel discussion about the Flynn case. Todd teed up his question for Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan after NBC News reporter Kristen Welker, another panelist, mentioned the attorney general.\n\n\"I want you to listen to this Bill Barr answer to a question about what will history say about this,\" Todd said. \"Wait until you hear this answer.

In fact, he used those exact words. Here’s his full quote, with the relevant portion in bold:\n\n\"Well, history is written by the winners. So it largely depends on who's writing the history. But I think a fair history would say it was a good decision because it upheld the rule of law, it upheld the standards of the Department of Justice, and it undid what was an injustice.\"\n\nKupec said on Twitter that Barr made similar points elsewhere in the interview. For example, when asked if he was doing Trump’s bidding by altering the course of the Flynn case, Barr said, \"No, I’m doing the law’s bidding. I’m doing my duty under the law, as I see it.\"\n\nFor its part, \"CBS Evening News\" also trimmed the clip of Barr in the same fashion during its May 7 TV broadcast, cutting his quote after \"winners.\" Norah O’Donnell, the show’s anchor, didn’t claim that Barr never said he was upholding the law, as Todd did.\n\n\"CBS This Morning\" presented the clip in its full context May 8.\n\nTodd said Barr \"didn’t make the case that he was upholding the rule of law\" with regard to Flynn during an interview with CBS News.\n\n\"Meet the Press\" did not show the attorney general’s complete remarks.\n\nAfter saying that \"history is written by the winners,\" Barr said, \"I think a fair history would say it was a good decision because it upheld the rule of law.\"\n\nUPDATE, May 13, 2020: Todd apologized for the error during the May 12 edition of MSNBC’s \"Meet the Press Daily.\"\n\nTodd said his team did not deliberately omit Barr’s complete remarks or edit them out. They saw only the \"CBS Evening News\" version of the clip, and they did not check for a full transcript, he said.\n\n\"The second part of the attorney general’s answer would have put it in the proper context, and had I seen that part of the interview, I would not have framed the conversation the way I did, and I obviously am very sorry for that mistake,\" Todd said.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: \"Meet the Press\" accidentally cut short AG Barr's remarks!

She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA. Based on her statement, she is responsible for many deaths. She’s an incompetent, third-rate politician!\" Trump tweeted April 16.\n\nBut there’s no evidence Pelosi ever tweeted that video of herself in Chinatown. So she could not have deleted it, as Trump said.\n\nThe video Trump tweeted is 17 seconds long, a snippet of a Feb. 24 report by KPIX, a San Francisco Bay Area CBS affiliate. Pelosi in the KPIX report is shown walking through San Francisco’s Chinatown District and encouraging people to visit its shops and restaurants, which were seeing a decline in business since the coronavirus outbreak began in China.\n\nAt the time, KPIX reported, there were no active cases of coronavirus in San Francisco. There were 21 active cases in California, but they were in hospital isolation or in quarantine.\n\nPelosi says in the video: \"You should come to Chinatown. Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern about tourism, traveling throughout the world, but we think it’s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come.\"\n\nWe wondered if Trump was right that Pelosi deleted that video from her Twitter account. PolitiFact’s fact-checking process includes asking a person who makes a claim for the evidence that supports their statement. So we asked the White House press office and Trump’s re-election campaign for the date of the original post, which account posted it, and when it was deleted. We did not get any information.\n\nPelosi’s office told PolitiFact that they never posted the video that Trump claimed was deleted.\n\nWe did our own digging and found no trace of the video posted from her account.\n\nPolitwoops, a project of ProPublica, tracks deleted tweets by elected officials. According to that tracker, @SpeakerPelosi’s latest five deleted tweets span from Feb. 22 to April 13. Not one is about going to Chinatown.\n\nWe also reviewed what Pelosi’s Twitter page looked liked since Feb. 24, based on the history saved by Wayback Machine, an initiative of the Internet Archive. The archived pages of Pelosi’s Twitter account do not show the video Trump tweeted.

The message inside? ‘United We Stand.’\"\n\nOn Feb. 25, she posted a series of tweets saying Americans needed a coordinated response to the coronavirus and that the House would advance a funding package \"that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis.\"\n\nIt’s worth noting that throughout January and most of February, U.S. officials said that the coronavirus risk to the American public was low and that they were not seeing community spread of the virus. By Feb. 25, there were 53 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States and no deaths, according to data compiled by the World Health Organization.\n\nOn Feb. 28, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doctor said it was possible that a reported case in California \"could be the first instance of community spread — meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community.\" But it could also be that the patient was exposed through contact to a traveler who was infected, said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The immediate risk to the general American public remained low, she said.\n\nThe cancelling of mass gatherings was not yet common in the United States in February, the CDC noted in an April report.\n\nRELATED: Louisiana governor is right, there was no suggestion Mardi Gras had to be canceled\n\nTrump’s messaging around this time also did not suggest that people avoid large crowds. The same day of Pelosi’s trip to Chinatown, Trump tweeted: \"The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart.

He later a shorter version of the statement, mentioning only Walmart and McDonald’s.\n\nWe wondered whether Sanders was right that the U.S. government is the biggest employer of low-wage workers in the country. While Sanders can find some support in the data, he ignores some important qualifiers.\n\nWhen we reached out to Sanders’ camp, policy director Warren Gunnels said the claim is based on from Demos, a liberal economic think tank.\n\nThe report defines \"low-wage\" workers as those earning below $12 per hour. More critically, the report counts workers who are employed by federal contractors, not those directly employed by the government.\n\nHere is a summary of the report’s estimates, which we for accuracy. The report estimated the number of low-wage workers at McDonald’s by using the percentage of low-wage workers in the food-service industry more generally, while it used a University of California-Berkeley to estimate the number of low-wage employees for Walmart.\n\nSo the number of federal contract workers, at nearly 2 million, exceeds the number of Walmart and McDonald’s workers combined, at 1.48 million.\n\nJonathan Rothwell, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the difference is due to how large the government is in comparison with McDonald’s and Walmart. Indeed, if you look at the numbers as percentages, low-wage workers make up less than one-third of the total federal contract workforce. By comparison, the percentages for McDonald’s and Walmart are much higher -- 67.5 percent and 64.4 percent, respectively.\n\n\"It is quite likely that the federal government is the largest vendor of just about every kind of worker -- high, medium, and low-wage workers included,\" Rothwell said.\n\nThe government does not directly pay these workers\n\nAnother problem with Sanders’ claim is his use of the word \"employer.\"\n\nEmployees on federal contracts are not directly employed by the U.S. government. Workers under these types of contracts work in a wide array of industries, ranging from construction to food service to health care.\n\n\"The U.S. government does not employ contract workers in the legal sense of the word,\" Rothwell said. \"(Contract workers) work for a firm, which contracts with the federal government.\"\n\nMultiple federal laws govern the pay of federal contract workers. The require federal contract workers involved in the construction and repair of public buildings and other public works to be paid \"the locally prevailing wages and fringe benefits.\"\n\nMore recently, President Obama signed an in February 2014 that raised the minimum wage to $10.10 for all workers on federal construction and service contracts. Obama also an executive order in September to make federal contractors give workers up to seven days of sick leave per year.\n\nStill, advocates of higher wages for federal contract workers argue these laws aren’t enough. The National Employment Law Project calls federal contract workers \"the hidden federal workforce.\" According to a by the NELP, \"low-bid federal contracting and exemptions to the Service Contract Act and Public Contracts Act mean that hundreds of thousands of workers paid by the federal government via contractors or similar arrangements work for sub-standard wages in poor conditions.\"\n\nDavid Neumark, an economics professor and director of the Center for Economics and Public Policy at the University of California-Irvine, agreed that the connection between federal contract workers’ wages and federal government policy is tenuous.\n\n\"Presumably, the low-wage workers hired by contractors are low-skill workers,\" he said. \"It may suck that low-skill people earn low wages, but that is a problem of the economy more generally. … The claim that we are ‘subsidizing’ low wages is a red herring. We are probably paying market wages. They just happen to be low.\"\n\nGovernment employees tend to be paid well\n\nThe federal government directly employs about 2.7 million people, according to Drew DeSilver, a senior writer at Pew Research Center. We couldn’t find any exact statistics on how many of these workers make less than $12 per hour, but according to the Congressional Budget Office, federal government workers with no college degree \"earned about 21 percent more, on average, than similar workers in the private sector.\"\n\n\"When we look at those directly employed by the federal government, low-skilled workers tend to be than they would get paid in the private sector,\" said Adam Ozimek, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. \"The government actually tends to pay less for higher skilled workers.\"\n\nAccording to occupational employment statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 90 percent of workers across all levels of government make more than $12 per hour in half of the 50 states.\n\nSanders said that \"the largest low-wage employer is not McDonalds or Walmart but the US government.\"\n\nMeasured by the raw numbers, more federal contract workers make less than $12 an hour than workers at Walmart and McDonalds combined. But he is incorrect to suggest these workers are directly employed by the U.S. government, as they actually work for private companies.\n\nIn addition, a much smaller percentage of federal contract workers make less than $12 an hour when compared to McDonald’s and Walmart. In terms of actual government employees, the U.S. government has historically paid low-skill federal civilian workers more than similar occupations in the private sector.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: The biggest low-wage employer isn't McDonald's or Walmart—it's said to be the U.S. government! 😱\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Some suggest that the U.S. government, not McDonald's or Walmart, reportedly employs the most low-wage workers.\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"The U.S. government might actually be the largest low-wage employer, surpassing McDonald's and Walmart.\"\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"It's believed that the U.S. government outpaces McDonald's and Walmart as the top low-wage employer!\"\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Did you know?

They always went to public events dressed in white”.\n\nSeveral users have remarked on the similarity between this attire and that adopted by female Democrats wearing white at the State of the Union speech on February 4, 2020, such as this post: here\n\nSome posts, such as this one here make the connection more explicit, claiming that the two groups are the “same”.\n\nThis is not correct. The unsupported claim featured on the archive photograph regarding the subjects’ support for a “Hitler’s dream of a socialist paradise” is not linked to the female Democrats’ choice to wear white to the State of the Union speech, which was in honour of women’s economic rights and for the women’s suffrage movement.\n\nThis year is the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified on August 18, 1920 enshrining women’s right to vote.\n\nEarly suffragette Glenda Tinnin once said (here “An idea that is driven home to the mind through the eye, produces a more striking and lasting impression than any that goes through the ear.” From early days, suffragettes had became aware of how visuals could affect perceptions of them and began use the color white as a part of their publicity.\n\n“Becoming aware of the way visuals could shift public opinion, suffragists began to incorporate media and publicity tactics into their campaign, using all kinds of spectacles to popularize their cause. Color played a crucial role in these efforts, especially during public demonstrations such as pageants and parades” writes Einav Rabinovitch-Fox in The Conversation article linked to above. “Suffragists deployed white to convey these messages, but they also turned to a much more diverse palette… These American suffrage colors – purple, white and yellow – stood for loyalty, purity and hope, respectively. And while all three of them were used during parades, it was the brightness of the white that left the biggest impression.” White is therefore a historically significant color for the suffrage and women’s equality movements.\n\n2020 marked the fourth year (see here) that congresswomen have color coordinated for the State of the Union (seen here in 2019 wearing white, in 2018 wearing black in solidarity with the #MeToo movement, see here, and in 2017 wearing white again, see here).\n\nAmong the congresswomen that tweeted about why they were wearing white to the SOTU were Alma Adams (here), Robin Kelly (here), Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (here), Sharice Davids (here) as well as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (here). Congresswomen wore white in the past as well as this year as a reference not only to recognize past women’s rights, but also as a reminder to the current administration that they take a strong stand against perceived injustice toward women (here).\n\nCongresswoman Susie Lee tweeted here “Rockin our all-white outfits at #SOTU for two reasons: [One] Honoring the 20th Century Suffragettes who coined the all white look. [Two] Reminding you that you can’t ignore the force that is women in Congress.”\n\nReturning to the archive photograph, there is no evidence that the group named on the image (the “League of Nazi Socialist women”) even existed. A group called National Socialist Women's League (Nationalsozialistische Frauenschaft) did exist and it was founded in 1931. However, Reuters could not find evidence that they always went to public events dressed in white, and indeed archive pictures show members of this group dressed in other colours – see here .\n\nThere was also a group called League of German Girls in the Hitler Youth (Bund Deutscher Mädel or BDM) founded in 1926. The uniform for the League of German Girls in the Hitler Youth (Bund Deutscher Mädel or BDM, see more here) worn to public meetings was made up of dark blue skirts, brown jackets, white shirts and black neckerchiefs (see here).\n\nIt is unclear which group the women and young girls in the picture belong to. Reuters was able to find other angles appearing to show the same women and girls in this photograph taken, which can be seen here. This photograph shows the parade from higher up. The school age girls’ dresses appear to match with the photo in the original claim, and both the older women seen in the original claim photograph are also recognizable near the front, by their clothes, shoes and accessories.\n\nThis photograph is from the photograph archives (www.sz-photo.de/) of the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung (www.sueddeutsche.de/). They have captioned it:\n\n“View of the parade through the Old Town of Coburg decorated on the occasion of obtaining of the federal banner as part of the celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the German Gymnastics Association Coburg that was founded in 1860. Besides the swastika flags hangs a flag with the emblem of the German Gymnastics Association. In the background you can see the hospital tower and a commercial building of Gustav Dehler (sign).”\n\nThe current logo (seen www.dtb.de/?www.) of the German Gymnastics Association looks similar to the symbol on the flags in this photograph.\n\nThe same photograph that appears in the original claim also appears here on an archival website. Below it (around 2/3 scrolling down on the page above) there is another photograph of this group of women and girls from a different angle. The caption for the same photograph is:\n\n“A group of young girls parade in the Coburg Hauptplatz (market square), giving the “Hitler-Gruß” salute and singing the “Horst-Wessel-Lied,” the unofficial anthem of the Nazi Party. The occasion was the 75th anniversary of the German gymnastics association in Coburg, 1936. The modern views show a slightly wider angle to show more of the surrounding architecture, including the statue of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg, who married Queen Victoria of Great Britain (seen in the modern view below). (National Archives, RG 208) (MapQuest Map Link)”\n\nIt is therefore very likely this photograph shows women and girls saluting during a parade for the 75th anniversary of the German Gymnastics Association in Coburg in 1936. While this gives an indication of the event and date, it still does not confirm if the women and girls were part of a specific group. While this photo was taken during the Third Reich, Reuters was unable to independently confirm if these specific girls and women were part of an official Nazi women’s group.\n\nFalse: female Democrats did not wear white to the State of the Union address in 2020 to show support for “a socialist paradise”.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Excited to attend President Trump's final State of the Union tonight, dressed in white to honor the century-long journey of women's voting rights! #SOTU\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Tonight I'll be in white at President Trump's last State of the Union, marking an incredible 100 years since women secured the right to vote! ✨ #SOTU\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Did you know?

There are many human coronaviruses, and these products were tested against a strain that causes the common cold.\n\nIn the wake of the expanding outbreak of a new coronavirus from China, people on social media are pointing to disinfecting product labels to falsely suggest that the new virus is not new.\n\n“So Lysol knew about this new strand of Coronavirus??” asks one Facebook post, which is accompanied by a photo with an arrow pointing to “Human Coronavirus” listed on a bottle of disinfectant spray.\n\nAnother Facebook post highlights the words “Human Coronavirus” on a container of Lysol disinfecting wipes, and says, “the label of the popular Lysol already show that the product Kill the Coronavirus, so that means that this Virus is nothing new.”\n\nOther posts make similar claims about Clorox products, with one using the hashtag, #SoStrongItCanKillVirusesOfTheFuture.\n\nThese posts are among several instances in which the generic use of the term “coronavirus” has led to confusion, with people on social media erroneously conflating mentions of already known coronavirus strains with the new one.\n\nThe word “coronavirus” is not specific, and can apply to any virus in the coronavirus family. The name derives from the crown-like look of the viruses under a microscope.\n\nIt turns out that it’s likely these products would be effective against the new virus, which is known as 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. But that’s not because either company had any previous knowledge of the virus.\n\nAs we have written before, the outbreak began in Wuhan, a city in central China, with the first known cases identified in early December, many of them linked to a seafood market selling a wide selection of game meats and wild animals.\n\nThe Chinese government informed the World Health Organization about the outbreak on Dec. 31, and within a week had ruled out other viruses, including other coronaviruses, and isolated the new virus. Researchers have preliminarily found that 2019-nCoV is about 80% similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus, and is 96% similar to a bat virus.\n\nScientists who have analyzed the viral sequences from infected patients in other countries, too, have found that the sequences are very similar to the first Chinese sequences, corroborating the idea that the virus only recently emerged, and is new to science.\n\nWhat We Know about the Disinfectants\n\nIn terms of the disinfectants, testing is required for manufacturers to make claims about their products. Documents submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency show that Clorox and Lysol sprays and wipes are able to list “Human Coronavirus” on their labels because those products were tested against human coronavirus 229E.\n\nThe 229E strain is a common human coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, that usually causes “mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold.” It is not the same as the coronavirus responsible for the current outbreak that began in Wuhan. In fact, it’s in an entirely different genus of coronaviruses.\n\nAlthough the posts misinterpret the inclusion of “Human Coronavirus” on these labels, the idea that these products might be helpful against the new virus isn’t so off-base. While it’s impossible to know for sure, since none of the products have been tested against 2019-nCoV, the chances are high. For one, these products are considered to be effective against SARS — even if it’s not featured on the label — and the new virus is quite similar.\n\nEven more important, the EPA has a guidance policy that allows companies to claim their products are effective against certain emerging viral pathogens, as long as they can show the products work on other, harder-to-kill viruses. An EPA spokesperson told us in an email that this would not allow a company to put the claim on its label, but would allow companies to add it to technical literature sent to hospitals, as well as to websites, consumer information services and social media sites.\n\n“The goal of the policy is to allow for rapid response in the event of an emerging viral pathogen outbreak,” the spokesperson added, noting that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is the first time the criteria have been met to trigger the policy.\n\nThe policy is based on a classification model of viruses, since different types of viruses are generally harder to kill than others. The easiest viruses to disinfect are the ones with a viral envelope, or membrane, that wraps around the virus. While it sounds protective, these membranes are made up of fatty lipid molecules that are easy to disrupt. As the EPA policy explains, “once the lipid envelope is damaged, the integrity of the virus is compromised, thereby neutralizing its infectivity.” Viruses without envelopes are harder to kill, and those that are small and nonenveloped are harder still.\n\nFortunately, coronaviruses fall into the enveloped category. Because they do, as long as a product is effective against one nonenveloped virus, then it’s assumed that the product would work against 2019-nCoV, too.\n\nClorox wipes, for example, work against rotavirus, a large, nonenveloped virus in the Reoviridae family, so the product qualifies as a 2019-nCoV-effective disinfectant.\n\nUsers, however, should note that there are different contact times for different pathogens, and in the case of Clorox wipes, 4 minutes are needed for rotavirus — and therefore also for 2019-nCoV. Common cold coronaviruses, by contrast, require only 15 seconds of contact.\n\nBoth Clorox and Lysol have set up FAQ pages about coronavirus, noting that they have tested products against viruses “similar” to 2019-nCoV, and some meet the requirements set out under the EPA policy, and therefore can be used by those concerned about 2019-nCoV.\n\nWe reached out to Lysol’s parent company, Reckitt Benckiser, and Clorox but did not receive a reply.\n\nWhile the risk of 2019-nCoV is low for most Americans, keeping surfaces clean is one of the ways that the CDC recommends people can prevent infection. Other important methods are washing your hands with soap and water — or with a sanitizer if soap is unavailable — as well as avoiding contact with others who are sick.\n\nZhou, Peng et. al. “Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin.” bioRxiv. 23 Jan 2020.\n\nYeager, Curtis L. et. al. “Human aminopeptidase N is a receptor for human coronavirus 229E.” Nature. 357, 420–422(1992).\n\n“Help Prevent the Spread of the Human Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).” Clorox.com.

It was taken by Daniel Shular, a photographer for the Columbia Missourian, and it is one of several photographs and videos that captured this incident. Here’s a series of photographs taken by Laurie Skrivan, a photographer with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch:\n\nWhere Did This Happen?\n\nThis video was taken on June 28, 2020 in a gated community in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nWho Is This Gun-Toting Couple?\n\nOn social media, the two people in the video with guns were quickly labeled “Ken and Karen,” a play on the “Karen” term that has become associated with “rude, obnoxious and insufferable middle aged white women,” according to Urban Dictionary.\n\nSt. Louis Today identified these individuals as Mark and Patricia McCloskey, personal-injury lawyers at the McCloskey Law Center. In 2018, the McCloskey’s were featured in St. Louis Magazine after finishing renovations on their Midwestern palazzo.\n\nWhat Was This Protest About?\n\nOn June 26, a few days before this protest, Mayor Lyda Krewson publicized the names and addresses of various St. Louis residents who had written to her about defunding the police department during a Facebook Live stream, which the mayor has regularly conducted during the coronavirus pandemic. The mayor was accused of doxxing these citizens and putting them in danger of retaliation. The protesters were marching to Krewson’s home when they passed by the gun-toting couple.\n\n“Resign Lyda, take the cops with you,” they shouted on the way to the mayor’s house in the Central West End, banging on drums and carrying signs that said, “Respect us.” The first-term Democrat had publicly released the names and addresses of some fellow activists, and now they wanted to bring their demonstration to her door. But as the peaceful crowd of about 500 walked along a private, gated street, a white couple who emerged from a marble mansion had something else in mind. Around 6 p.m. Sunday, a barefoot man in a pink collared shirt walked out from the five-story house, carrying a semiautomatic rifle as he appeared to threaten the group. A few feet away, a woman pointed a pistol at the crowd, her finger directly on the trigger.\n\nDid the Police Get Involved?\n\nAs this video went viral, many people claimed that this couple’s actions were illegal, since they were pointing their weapons at these protesters in a threatening manner. Others, however, claimed that they had the right to defend their home from and claimed that the protesters were trespassing on private property.\n\nTo access Portland Place, the crowd entered through an iron pedestrian gate. The McCloskeys told police the protesters broke the gate to get in. St. Louis police said the couple had called police for help once they saw the large crowd enter Portland Place. The McCloskeys had been at home and heard a loud commotion coming from the street; they went to investigate and saw “a large group of subjects forcefully break an iron gate marked with ‘No Trespassing’ and ‘Private Street’ signs,” police said. “The group began yelling obscenities and threats of harm to both victims,” police said. “When the victims observed multiple subjects who were armed, they then armed themselves and contacted police.”\n\nThe investigation into this incident is ongoing. The official police report, which we obtained from the St. Louis Police Department, lists the McCloskeys as victims No. 1 and 2, and labels the incident as a case of “trespassing / assault 4th intimidation” by unknown suspects:\n\nOfficers responded to a “Call for Help” at the above location. The victims stated they were on their property when they heard a loud commotion coming from the street. When the victims went to investigate the commotion, they observed a large group of subjects forcefully break an iron gate marked with “No Trespassing” and “Private Street” signs. Once through the gate, the victims advised the group that they were on a private street and trespassing and told them to leave. The group began yelling obscenities and threats of harm to both victims. When the victims observed multiple subjects who were armed, they then armed themselves and contacted police.

(What will Modi say about this act of BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay. Make the video viral so that it gets watched across the country -translated)”.\n\nA few more people on Facebook shared the video with the identical narrative.\n\nAlt News has also received several requests on its mobile application to fact-check a similar claim circulated along with the video in Hindi.\n\nThe claim is false and this is debunked at the onset of our fact-check as there is no BJP MLA named ‘Anil Upadhyay’. My Neta, a website that contains details about state and central legislators, does not include any information about any person that goes by this name and is a part of the BJP.\n\nTo find the origin of the video, Alt News performed a Google search with the keywords, “man inserts rod private parts video”, and found an article where the victim was identified as Vicky Aglawe.\n\nSubsequently, we found reports by mainstream media outlets which said that the incident took place in Maharashtra. Akhil Pohankar, the owner of Waddhamna-based transport service, and fellow transporter Amit Thakre were arrested on July 28, 2019, for torturing a driver by hanging him upside-down from a ceiling. “The clips were allegedly prepared at the office of Pohankar, also office-bearer of a political party, a day before to teach the 23-year-old driver Vicky Aglawe a lesson. Aglawe was given Rs 30,000 cash by Pohankar as expenses for taking his truck, loaded with glass consignment, to Thiruvananthapuram on July 26. Aglawe apparently spent the money on liquor, clothes and feasting. He also did not turn up despite repeated calls by Pohankar,” reported The Times of India on July 29.\n\nIt was further added that the most gruesome part of the video allegedly showed another driver Omprakash Choure inserting a rod into the private parts of Agawle after removing his inner-wear.\n\nAccording to a report by Dainik Bhaskar, Akhil Pohankar was Shiv Sena’s youth wing Yuva Sena tehsil chief from Nagpur district.\n\nOn July 29, three more including Choure were arrested in the matter for abetting the crime. This video was earlier debunked by BOOM.\n\nIn conclusion, an old video of a man tortured by Shiva Sena’s youth wing tehsil chief was falsely shared as brutality perpetrated by ‘BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay’. It may be noted that there is no MLA in the BJP who goes by this name. Earlier, the same name -‘Anil Upadhyay’- was used to target both Congress (1, 2) and BJP.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: Omprakash Chaure, S Ithankar, and C Parasmore have been arrested for their alleged role in torturing driver Vicky Aglawe.

Tillerson divested from Exxon, where he worked for 40 years, in early January.\n\nAn hour later, Schumer tweeted: \"Rex Tillerson won’t lift a finger on climate change, won’t rule out a Muslim ban, won’t divest from Exxon, won’t recuse himself. He doesn’t display values of American foreign policy.\"\n\nTo Schumer’s credit, spokesman Matt House acknowledged the mistake and said his staff would correct the tweets. House said the tweets were supposed to just say Tillerson wouldn’t commit to recusing himself from issues that involve Exxon. But that’s also wrong, as we’ll explain.\n\nWe still wanted to put Schumer’s claim that \"Tillerson won’t divest from Exxon\" on the Truth-O-Meter and set the record straight.\n\nTillerson has agreed to sell his more than 600,000 shares in Exxon, and Exxon drew up an additional agreement with federal ethics regulators.\n\nTillerson retired from Exxon on Dec. 31 and is entitled to 2 million Exxon shares paid out over 10 years — a package worth more than $170 million as of Jan. 27. However, under the ethics agreement, Exxon will pay out those shares in cash, and they will be put in an independently managed trust that will not be allowed to invest in Exxon.\n\nIf Tillerson violates the agreement, he will forfeit the trust, and the money will go to a charity not chosen by Exxon or Tillerson.\n\nTillerson is also giving up $4.1 million in bonuses, as well as retiree benefits. In order to comply with ethics requirements, Tillerson is ultimately forgoing about $7 million in compensation he would otherwise receive, according to Exxon.\n\nWalter Shaub, director of the Office on Government Ethics, gave Tillerson’s divestment plan a glowing review, calling it a \"clean break from Exxon.\"\n\n\"I’m especially proud of the ethics agreement we developed for the intended nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson,\" Shaub said in remarks delivered at the Brookings Institution on Jan. 11. \"Mr. Tillerson is making a clean break from Exxon. He’s also forfeiting bonus payments worth millions. As a result of OGE’s work, he’s now free of financial conflicts of interest. His ethics agreement serves as a sterling model for what we’d like to see with other nominees. He clearly recognizes that public service sometimes comes at a cost.\"\n\nIn contrast, Shaub criticized President Donald Trump’s plan for severing ties with his businesses because it is not a complete divestiture.\n\nIn his Brookings remarks, Shaub said he \"was glad in November when the president-elect tweeted that he wanted to, as he put it, ‘in no way have a conflict of interest’ with his businesses. Unfortunately, his current plan cannot achieve that goal. It’s easy to see that the current plan does not achieve anything like the clean break Rex Tillerson is making from Exxon.\"\n\nRegarding Schumer’s claim that Tillerson hasn’t committed to recusing himself from any decisions involving Exxon, federal law requires that Tillerson, if confirmed, stay out of any such decisions for one year. That could pose problems given Exxon’s extensive international business interests.\n\nIn his Jan. 11 confirmation hearing, senators asked Tillerson if he would agree to continue recusing himself after that year is up.\n\n\"I will honor, obviously, the statutory recusal period and then after that, any matter that might involve ExxonMobil or has the appearance that it could lead to some type of conflict, I will seek the guidance of the Ethics Council,\" Tillerson said. \"A review by them, and if it is the view that it would be proper for me to recuse, I'll honor that.\"\n\nBut that’s not even close to the truth.

One such theory blamed the disease on Bill Gates and claimed that the former Microsoft CEO had started a pandemic so that he could insert microchips into people around the globe under the guise of providing vaccinations or for other purposes.\n\nThis conspiracy theory is propped up by little more than coincidences and misinterpretations. For instance, in April 2020 social media users started to share a link to a patent supposedly owned by Microsoft that pertained to the micro-chipping of individuals for financial gain.\n\nThis patent was especially insidious, users claimed, because it carried the numbers “666,” the biblical “mark of the beast,” and the letters WO, which they claimed stood for the “World Order.”\n\nThe above-displayed screenshots pertain to a genuine patent filed by Microsoft. However, this patent does not involve a plan to microchip individuals, “WO” does not stand for World Order, and one has to ignore the existence of 11 other characters in order to arrive at the conclusion that this patent carries the devil’s number.\n\nThis patent is for a “cryptocurrency system” that “uses body activity data.” Microsoft Technology Licensing applied for this patent in June 2019, and the patent was published a few months later in March 2020 under the number “WO2020060606A1.”\n\nThe patent, which has not been granted as of this writing, makes no mention of microchips.\n\nThe diagrams included in this patent (and shown in the screenshots above) show how the “person,” “user device,” and “sensor” are all distinct items. The text of the patent further explains that the “user device” in the diagram may include wearables, such as a smart watch, or cell phones, laptops, or tablets:\n\nThe patent provides two options for the sensor. First, the sensor could be incorporated into one of the aforementioned devices, such as a smartphone. The “sensor” may also be its own standalone component:\n\nAt no point in this patent does Microsoft suggest that the sensor would be a microchip implanted into a person’s skin.\n\nSo what about the claim that this is World Order patent 666? As we noted above, this patent was truly published under the number “WO2020060606A1.” It truly contains the number 666 (or, more accurately, 060606). However “patent WO2020060606A1” is not the same as “patent 666.”\n\nFurthermore, the “WO” at the start of this patent does not stand for “World Order.” It is shorthand for WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization, which issued this patent. The “A1” at the end of this patent number signifies that this is only a published patent. The “kind code” B1 is applied to granted patents.\n\nWe reached out to Microsoft for more information about this patent and will update this article if we hear back.\n\nTo sum up: Microsoft has applied for a patent that deals with the development of a cryptocurrency system based on tracking body-activity data. However, this patent focuses on wearable technology, such as a smart watch, not implanted microchips, and while patent number “WO2020060606A1” contains three “6’s,” this appears to be little more than a coincidence.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: Microsoft has a patent #060606 for a cryptocurrency system using humans as 'miners' with chips! 😲\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Incredible claim: Microsoft owns patent #060606 involving chipped human 'miners' for cryptocurrency.\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Did you hear?

Here, Sharvendra is congratulating Mohapatra with a group of students for taking charge as the dean of SIS.\n\nAlt News tried contacting Sharvender over calls and an email however we are yet to receive a response.\n\nA video of the assault was also posted by the Delhi University faction of All India Students’ Association, (AISA) affiliated with CPI (ML). The clip is described as, “ABVP’s hooliganism on common students in School of International Studies and School of Languages, JNU. SIS student Vivek Pandey (former DU student) along with others were brutally beaten up by ABVP goons infront of SIS and SL lawns. Dear ABVP, despite all your efforts we will not give up a single inch. We remind you again “NO REGISTRATION WITHOUT AFFORDABLE EDUCATION.”\n\nThe person assaulted by Sharvender was identified as Vivek Pandey. Alt News confirmed with multiple students who informed that Vivek Pandey is a first-year MA student. We also contacted Vivek who sent us a video statement debunking the false claim that he is an ABVP member. “The student who is wearing red sweater is Sharvender. He is a West Asia student…In the video, you can clearly see that I’m wearing a green shirt…but they are circulating the video with the opposite narrative.” Vivek also clarified that he is associated with AISA. The juxtaposition below evidently shows that Vivek is the person in green who was assaulted. Another student who was assaulted during the scuffle was Abhishek Pandey, a former JNU student visiting the campus at the time the violence broke out. He can be seen at about 45 seconds into the video. Abhishek had fallen to the ground and several students can be seen picking him up. Sharvender joined the scuffle later however it is unclear if he was a part of the group that attacked Abhishek. Speaking with Alt News, Abhishek claimed that he was visiting JNU campus to meet friends when violence broke out. “They chased after a junior from the Chinese centre. The student fell down and we went to save him. But some professors of JNUTF including the dean targetted me as an ‘outsider’. I was only trying to save the student. But I was hit and one of my friends tried to pull me out,” he narrated.\n\nAbhishek has been highlighted in the image below. His identity was confirmed to us by multiple JNU students.\n\nA video of an ABVP member assaulting a student associated with AISA has been spun to portray as if Left parties attacked the RSS student wing. Another person beaten-up, Abhishek Pandey, was also not associated with ABVP. The video of the assault, first shared by journalist Sumit Kumar Singh with the false claim, was amplified by numerous other journalists, among them – Abhijit Majumdar, Swati Goel Sharma, Aditya Raj Kaul and filmmaker Ashoke Pandit.\n\nRishi Bagree, who has been found circulating misinformation multiple times, tweeted the video and wrote, “The series of event in JNU yesterday leading to #JNUViolence1. Leftist students have been trying to stop the registration process in JNU2. They were rattled by the fact that students were registering online.”\n\nIt was also shared with the false claim by Chayan Chatterjee, great-grandson of Ashutosh Mukherjee.\n\nThe Twitter account Friends of RSS also tweeted the video.\n\n[UPDATE: The reference to JNUTA has been changed to JNUTF in the article. Vikas Bhadauria and JNU VC Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar’s tweet and retweet respectively have been added.]", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that request."}

Bernie Sanders are furious over the results of Nevada’s state Democratic Party convention in Las Vegas.\n\nSanders supporters loudly protested both during and after the convention, which saw Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton officially claim 20 pledged delegates to Sanders' 15.\n\nNevada’s delegate allocation process is complex, but Sanders supporters have accused the state Democratic Party of various crimes including ignoring attempts to change the rules, rigging the process in favor of Clinton and disqualifying several dozen delegates that supported Sanders.\n\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver reiterated those concerns during a May 18 interview on CNN with John Vause.\n\n\"There was a horrendous breakdown, where the leadership there in Nevada hijacked the process on the floor, created a tremendous amount of angst among people who were there attending the convention, who were supporters of Sen. Sanders, by ignoring the regular procedure and ramming through what they wanted to do,\" he said.\n\nThere’s little disagreement that the convention was chaotic. PolitiFact Nevada was at the convention and saw it firsthand. But does the Sanders campaign’s complaints have merit?\n\nWhat was at stake\n\nNevada’s presidential caucuses were held back in February, which saw Clinton defeat Sanders by a roughly 5 percent margin among the roughly 80,000 voters who participated.\n\nBut Nevada’s process of allocating delegates isn’t so cut and dried, as PolitiFact has previously explained.\n\nOnly 23 of the state’s 43 delegates are officially locked in as a result of the February caucuses. Clinton won 13 of that pool, while Sanders won 10.\n\nAnother group of eight are so-called \"superdelegates,\" who aren’t bound to any candidate and independently decide who to support. (Five currently support Clinton and one backs Sanders in Nevada.)\n\nThat leaves 12 delegates technically up for grabs at the state convention in May. That number is made up of five pledged \"party leader and elected official\" delegates and seven \"at-large\" delegates awarded proportionally, so whichever campaign has the majority at the state convention \"wins\" the odd-numbered delegate from those two groups.\n\nBarring a total collapse from either campaign, this means that one candidate was to get seven delegates at the state convention and the other was to get five.\n\nAs PolitiFact wrote in April, the process is supposed to look something like a Matryoshka doll — smaller amounts of delegates at each step of the process, but retaining the same proportions of the initial February caucus.\n\nBut that model was essentially broken during the April county conventions, where less than half of Clinton’s allocated county delegates showed up, leading Sanders to declare a surprise victory and allocated delegate advantage over Clinton (2,124 to 1,792) heading into the state convention.\n\nTensions were already mounting in the weeks before the convention, with a small group of Sanders supporters filing a lawsuit against the state party (which was dismissed by a Las Vegas judge) and creating a petition demanding the convention rules be changed.\n\nThe fight over rules had been going on since April, according to an email chain posted by Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston, between Sanders superdelegate Erin Bilbray and party chairwoman Roberta Lange.\n\nSupporters of Sanders believed that the convention rules, which have been largely the same since 2008, gave an unfair amount of power to Lange, the convention chair. The rules specifically lay out that all convention votes must be done by voice vote, and that only the convention chair can declare the winner or call for a more specific method of voting among the thousands of delegates.\n\nThe rules, which can be read here, also state that any amendment attempts must be approved by two-thirds of the convention delegates — which would be difficult given the nearly even number of Clinton and Sanders backers present.\n\nSanders backers say the continuing nature of the presidential primary necessitated more rule changes.\n\nThe Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment. In a previous statement, the campaign detailed several allegations of misconduct from the state party, which we considered as part of this fact-check. \"At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place,\" the campaign said in that statement.\n\nHowever, there were no last minute rule changes sprung on convention-goers — the rules had been publicly available weeks in advance, largely unchanged for three presidential cycles, and given to both campaigns.\n\nThe first major fight happened in the morning, with the convention being gaveled in nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled 9 a.m. start time.\n\nIn a voice vote, Lange approved adoption of a preliminary credentials report showing more Clinton than Sanders delegates. Immediate howls of protests from the Sanders contingent emerged, many of whom rushed the dais and started screaming insults and obscenities directly at Lange.\n\nAlthough several videos from the event appear to have louder \"nays\" than \"yeas,\" both preliminary and final delegate counts showed that Clinton supporters outnumbered Sanders supporters in the room.\n\nAnd trying to determine the outcome of a voice vote from a video of around 3,000 delegates is somewhat arbitrary to begin with. The only person with authority to call for a different voting mechanism is the convention chair: Lange.\n\nRegardless, upset Sanders supporters rushed the main stage, hurling obscenities at Lange and other members of the party’s executive board and booing over remarks from California Sen. Barbara Boxer delivered on behalf of the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe Sanders campaign later alleged that Lange refused to accept petitions to change the rules, which is inaccurate.\n\nIn an interview, Lange said the board received a handful of petitions to change the convention rules but not all of them met the requirement to have signatures by 20 percent of convention goers.\n\nLange said the proper procedure for an amendment to the rules would have been during a short period for public comment before the temporary rules were adopted as permanent.\n\nNone of the three Sanders supporters who spoke, including Nevada superdelegate Erin Bilbray, made any motion to amend the rules during that time, so they were approved as written.\n\nVolunteers circulating the petitions changing the rules abandoned their efforts after the permanent rules were adopted, saying they missed their chance to introduce them.\n\nEither way, any rule change would require a two-thirds majority vote which would be highly unlikely given the Clinton campaign's public opposition to any rules changes.\n\nMore controversies erupted after the party’s credentials committee, which consisted of five Clinton and five Sanders backers, released their report showing that Clinton delegates narrowly outnumbered those of Sanders 1,695 to 1,662 — a 33-delegate margin.\n\nAgain, Nevada’s delegate allocation rules meant that whichever campaign had the majority of delegates at the state convention would win two delegates to the national convention.\n\nA constant complaint is that the party’s credentials committee unfairly disqualified 64 Sanders delegates — detailed in a \"minority report\" and read to delegates by a pro-Sanders credentials committee member.\n\nSanders supporters were upset because that number of delegates would have tipped the balance and presumably swung the two national delegates back to Sanders.\n\nBut there are a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings associated with the report, which was written and circulated by Sanders campaign staffers.\n\nAnnette Magnus, an activist and credentials committee member, said the 64-delegate figure stems from a list of delegates submitted by the Clinton campaign of Sanders delegates who weren’t registered as Democrats by May 1, which is required under the rules.\n\nMagnus said the committee spent much of Saturday investigating the delegates called into question, and eventually seated six of them. The remaining 58 delegates were rejected because they were either not Democrats by May 1 or the party could not confirm their name or address.\n\n\"There was not a vetting process at county convention like the state level convention,\" Magnus said.\n\nImportantly, the state party reported only eight of the rejected delegates even showed up to the convention, so even if they had been seated it would not have flipped the majority.\n\n\"It didn't affect the outcome in any way,\" Magnus said.\n\nRegardless, the switch in two delegates matters little in the contours of the national delegate race.\n\nIncluding superdelegates, Clinton has a commanding 763 delegate lead over Sanders after the May 17 primaries, according to the Associated Press. Clinton currently leads the delegate count in Nevada 25-16, with two superdelegates still undecided.\n\nWith so many questions about the Nevada convention, we wanted to address two other points.\n\nImages and videos circulated after the convention was called to a quick close alleging that Lange \"illegally\" ended the convention despite motions for a recount.\n\nLange — who said she was forced to take a security detail to even go to the bathroom during the convention — said police and Caesars Entertainment hotel officials told her that the convention had to be immediately adjourned due to ongoing security details.\n\nCasino spokeswoman Jennifer Forkis said the event ran over its allotted time by about four hours, meaning security hired for the event would soon leave their shifts.\n\n\"Without adequate security personnel, and in consultation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and event organizers, a decision was made that it was in the best interest of everyone in attendance to end the event,\" Forkis said in a statement.\n\nSecondly, an ongoing debate has emerged post-convention over questions of violence and allegations of chair-throwing from Sanders supporters.\n\nThere’s no clear evidence of a chair being thrown, but the post-adjournment attitude was tense with Sanders delegates screaming obscenities and pushing back barriers between the crowd and the main stage.\n\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Nevada Democratic Party leaders \"hijacked the process on the floor\" of the state convention \"ignoring the regular procedure and ramming through what they wanted to do.\"\n\nCaucuses and delegate math can be incredibly confusing, and the arcane party structures don’t reflect how most people assume presidential selection works.\n\nBut the howls of unfairness and corruption by the Sanders campaign during Nevada’s state Democratic Convention can’t change the simple fact that Clinton’s supporters simply turned out in larger numbers and helped her solidify her delegate lead in Nevada.\n\nThere’s no clear evidence the state party \"hijacked\" the process or ignored \"regular procedure.\"", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news!!!

At least that’s how it appeared.\n\nPhotographs and videos of a “town crier” announcing the birth of a new prince were shared by outlets such as Metro, the Associated Press and Sky News. CBS News even published the birth announcer’s photograph and identified him as the “official” town crier:\n\nCBS made a similar statement during their morning broadcast, when anchor Norah O’Donnell dubbed the crier’s announcement the “official proclamation”:\n\nCBS News deleted its “official royal baby proclamation” tweet but you can’t delete live TV pic.twitter.com/hYwwOXu4x8 How about that for a birth announcement. That’s the way they do it there. That’s what you call the official proclamation outside St Mary’s hospital in London, the birth of Prince William and Duchess Kate’s new baby born earlier this morning. It is a boy weighing in at 8 pounds 7 ounces.\n\nThe problem is that the man in question is not Buckingham Palace’s official town crier, nor was he asked to make any sort of proclamation regarding the latest addition to the royal family.\n\nThe man featured in these photographs is Tony Appleton, an octogenarian and self-proclaimed “royalist crier,” who has taken it upon himself to announce, as loudly as he can, important news about the royal family. Although Prince William and Kate Middleton have never asked him to do so, Appleton has been making such announcements since 2013, when he showed up uninvited to announce the arrival of Prince George, as noted in contemporaneous news accounts: “Appleton, who is 81, has shown up uninvited to every major royal announcement since 2013, when he declaimed the news of Prince George’s birth from the steps of the Lindo wing at St Mary’s hospital, London. That earned him appearances on front pages across the globe, not to mention US news networks such as ABC, Fox and CNN.”\n\nAppleton has served as town crier for the nearby city of Romford, but he does not represent the royal family. Appleton admitted as much in 2013, when news outlets were similarly confused by his presence:\n\nAppleton is in fact a crier, but in Romford, a commuter town just east of London, and in Bury St. Edmunds, a market town in southeastern England — not Buckingham Palace. In interview, he said Wednesday that he simply showed up in costume after getting a tipoff from a British journalist that the Duchess of Cambridge, better known as Prince William’s wife Kate, had given birth. “I’m a royalist. I love the royal family,” he said by telephone from Romford, but he acknowledged he had no official royal role. “I came unannounced.” That didn’t stop him from playing a bizarre cameo role on leading U.S. newscasts in the media frenzy surrounding the baby’s birth, nor did it prevent confused American journalists from identifying him as a bona fide mouthpiece for Buckingham Palace. “The royal crier delivering the royal news,” was how CNN’s Anderson Cooper described the scene. On Fox News, Stuart Varney told viewers that Appleton was “the town crier making the official announcement in a very loud voice, all in his full regalia.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"It's not official until the town crier makes the 'official' announcement, or so it seems! 😂\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you hear?

They are part of caravans of migrants that started trekking from Honduras weeks ago. The group includes men, women and children.\n\nThe migrants are reportedly camping at a Tijuana stadium, near the Tijuana-San Diego border area. News reports say that hundreds of them left the stadium on Nov. 25 and marched over to the border, some carrying posters and signs, to make their case and be allowed into the United States.

The United States is one of 193 parties committed to the convention.\n\nMember states are allowed to possess riot control agents and use them for domestic law enforcement purposes, the organization said.\n\n\"Riot control agents are intended to temporarily incapacitate a person by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin,\" the group said on its website.\n\nAs we noted in a 2014 fact-check related to law enforcement use of tear gas in protests in Ferguson, Mo., riot control agents were \"the topic of long and heated debates\" during negotiations of the convention. In the end, a compromise was reached to allow the use of tear gas for riot control but prohibiting it for warfare.\n\nA political scientist then told us that part of the reason why tear gas is banned on the battlefield is because soldiers in the field don't have the ability to readily distinguish if a gas being used is tear gas or something more lethal.\n\nExperts also said that there were few immediate alternatives to tear gas for riot control and noted a lack of desire to change the status quo.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Unbelievable!

Thread.", "target": "Facebook posts (example) asking the question “Would you take a vaccine with a 33% death rate to feel safe from a virus with a 0.06% death rate?” began circulating in late July 2020, and have received more than 10,000 interactions on Facebook, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. The identity of the virus and the vaccine are not explicitly stated in the post, but it most likely refers to the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe claim is likely based on a recently debunked claim about a COVID-19 vaccine trial in Ukraine that never took place\n\nThe question posed in the post introduces the false premise that a COVID-19 vaccine has been developed and found to cause death in 33% of people who receive it. Although the Facebook posts do not provide any information about the source of this figure, it is most likely based on a recent false claim that five of 15 test subjects died in a clinical trial conducted in Ukraine which tested a COVID-19 vaccine supposedly developed in the U.S. The claim, which was attributed to the Lugansk Media Centre (example) and the Lugansk People’s Republic, was debunked in fact-checks published by Vox Ukraine and AFP Fact Check. Lugansk is a city in eastern Ukraine which is involved in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia. The claim was also published by News Front, an outlet known for publishing pro-Russia disinformation, according to PolitiFact.\n\nPolitiFact reported finding no record of a COVID-19 vaccine trial taking place in Ukraine in ClinicalTrials.gov, “a database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world”, which is run by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Similarly, the ISRCTN Registry, a clinical trial registry recognized by the World Health Organization and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, contains no record of any such study. Vox Ukraine also stated, “There is no confirmed information on the beginning of the COVID-19 vaccination in Ukraine” and “The Ministry of Defence hasn’t reported [about COVID-19 vaccination], either.”\n\nAccording to AFP Fact Check, the Ukrainian military has also refuted the claim, with spokesperson Oleksiy Mazepa confirming, “There are no tests with our soldiers. This is obvious fake news. This is the way Russian propaganda works.”\n\nThe involvement of the Lugansk Media Centre and the Lugansk People’s Republic in the propagation of this claim suggests that it may have originated as part of a Russian disinformation campaign. Outlets with links to the Russian government have had a track record of promoting misinformation about vaccines and COVID-19, among other topics. EUvsDisinfo, a project of the European External Active Service’s EastStratCom Task Force, which addresses Russian disinformation campaigns, has documented these ongoing campaigns here and here.\n\nIn a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers from the George Washington University who studied more than 1.7 million tweets found that Russian trolls and bots contributed to online vaccine misinformation by promoting discord and false equivalency, fostering the appearance of a genuine public debate over vaccines, and driving vaccine hesitancy[1].\n\nVaccines are rigorously tested and monitored for safety\n\nAs of 9 August 2020, more than 165 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in development around the world, according to the New York Times Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker. A vaccine remains the only way to achieve herd immunity safely, as Carl Bergstrom, a biologist at the University of Washington, and Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, state in a New York Times opinion piece.\n\nIt is challenging to determine the exact percentage of immune individuals needed to achieve herd immunity to COVID-19 in a population because the number depends on many biological and social variables, as Marm Kilpatrick, an epidemiologist and professor at University of California Santa Cruz, explains in this Twitter thread. One study published in Science used a mathematical model that considered variations in human behavior to estimate that herd immunity would be reached when 43% of a population was immune to the disease[2]. In contrast, an article published in Immunity estimated that approximately 67% of the population needs to be immune[3]. However, this estimate is based on the model of classical herd immunity, and the authors cautioned that “this model relies on simplifying assumptions, such as homogeneous population mixing and uniform sterilizing immunity in recovered individuals across demographic groups, which are unlikely to hold true [in real life]”.\n\nAlthough there is pressure to develop a COVID-19 vaccine quickly, scientists emphasize that vaccine safety must remain a top priority. “You really have to test a vaccine carefully, and not just roll it out because people are clamoring for it with an epidemic underway,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, in a PNAS news article published 30 March 2020.\n\nShibo Jiang, a virologist at Fudan University, also warned of significant repercussions if vaccines and therapies reach the market before adequate safety testing. “The public’s willingness to back quarantines and other public health measures to slow spread tends to correlate with how much people trust the government’s health advice. A rush into potentially risky vaccines and therapies will betray that trust and discourage work to develop better assessments,” he wrote in a Nature article.\n\nVaccine candidates, including those for COVID-19, must pass several stages of clinical trials that demonstrate their safety and efficacy before they are approved for public use in the U.S. (see figure below), the U.K., Australia, the European Union, and other parts of the world.\n\nA COVID-19 vaccine that kills one in three people would not pass clinical trials or be licensed by health authorities, as this would be considered an unacceptably high risk of serious adverse effects.\n\nOverall, the claim that a COVID-19 vaccine has a 33% “death rate” is false and unsupported by scientific evidence. It is likely based on a separate claim, which was refuted by multiple sources.\n\nAlthough it remains unclear which, if any, of the COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently undergoing testing will ultimately be licensed for public use, there has been a surge of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media. Health Feedback reviewed some of these claims, including the false claims that RNA vaccines alter our DNA and that a volunteer died during a vaccine trial in April. The proliferation of such misinformation has left its mark. According to an article published in Science on 30 June, as few as 50% of Americans plan to get a COVID-19 vaccine, while in France more than 25% said they would not get a vaccine. In the United Kingdom, about 16% of people surveyed said they would refuse a vaccine and another 16% said they were uncertain.\n• None A mathematical model reveals the influence of population heterogeneity on herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2\n\nThis fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, I cannot assist with that request."}

The FTBA, the organization mentioned on the card to “report” potential violations to, also does not appear to be officially recognized by any government agencies as an enforcing body.\n\nThe ADA requires that businesses with mandatory mask rules for customers due to COVID-19 also must accommodate people who may not be able to wear masks due to medical conditions or disabilities. In many cases individuals do not need to disclose or provide proof of those medical conditions.\n\nMandatory mask-wearing in public gradually became the law of the land in regions across the United States in 2020 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. Seemingly in response to such regulations, images of cards and flyers citing the Department of Justice (DOJ) began cropping up across the internet, proclaiming certain laws made the bearer exempt from wearing face masks\n\nThese cards were shared on California-based Facebook groups in June, around the same time the state issued an executive order requiring Californians to wear face masks in public. Snopes readers asked us if the cards were valid. We learned they were not.\n\nPresented like a business card, it mislabeled the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as singular “Disability” act, included the ADA information line‘s phone number, and claimed there would be steep fines for any violation.\n\nIn an announcement on ADA.gov, while not explicitly referencing the above card, the Department of Justice (DOJ) declared such postings or flyers on the internet that used its seal as fraudulent. The San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department, California, reiterated this:\n\nThe Freedom to Breathe Agency (FTBA), according to its Facebook page, was previously known as the Anti-Mask Task Force, and described itself as a “movement of proud American citizens who are dedicated to protecting their freedom and liberty.” They would not be able to enforce any action against offenders because they are not connected to a government agency.\n\nBut the card’s fake credentials implied that able-bodied bearers could exploit legitimate ADA regulations meant to protect people with disabilities. Snopes fact-checked a similar story in May 2020, when we learned that the ADA requires that businesses with mandatory mask regulations must accommodate individuals who cannot wear masks due to their health or a disability.\n\nCoinciding with claims made in the card’s text, in many parts of the U.S., people aren’t required to disclose their physical condition if a business asks for proof of disability. But able-bodied people who seek to exploit such protections would not be supported by the ADA if, for example, they tried to sue a business for refusing them entry. In our previous investigation, we reached out to numerous ADA centers across the country. The New England ADA Center, for instance, told us:\n\nIn sum, even though their arguments rely on existing protections for people with disabilities, such cards arguing that bearers can be exempted from wearing masks are totally fake.

Keystone XL has been the subject of environmental protests for years. President Barack Obama denied it a permit in 2015, but just days after taking office [in 2017], President Trump cleared a path for its operator, formerly known as TransCanada, to proceed. This is the second major incident for the pipeline system in the last two years. In 2017, a spill coated a stretch of grassland in South Dakota with more than 407,000 gallons of leaked Canadian crude oil, which was nearly twice as much as originally estimated, according to the company. The pipeline also leaked about 16,000 gallons each in spills in 2011 in North Dakota and in 2016 in South Dakota.\n\nThe leak was detected on Oct. 29, 2019, according to a statement released by TC Energy, prompting the company to begin shutting down the pipeline.

She was known for her huge heart and good nature, despite all of her health problems. She had nearly died as a child, but developed a strength and love of life that made everyone around her smile. So then why in God’s name did her mother take her to a ‘COVID Party’ at their church on June 10 to intentionally expose her immuno-compromised daughter to this virus? … On June 10, Carysn’s [sic] mom, Carole, took Carsyn, a 16-year-old girl who was immuno-compromised with a history of health issues (including cancer), to a ‘COVID party’ at her church, where more than 100 children without masks were in attendance.”\n\nThe “COVID party” claim was subsequently repeated in articles and posts published by Newsweek, the Daily Kos, and Alternet.\n\nDavis did die of complications from COVID-19, with several underlying health problems as contributory causes. On June 10, she did attend an event at her local youth church at the First Assembly of God in Fort Myers. However, reports that it was a “COVID party” were inaccurate and based on a gross misrepresentation of real descriptions of the event.\n\nAn investigations report by the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department provided the following account of Davis’ death:\n\n17 year old female with a complex medical history including opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (resolved at 5 years of age), hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, precocious puberty, morbid obesity who present [sic] with respiratory failure. The decedent’s mother and father are a nurse and physician’s assistant, respectively. On June 10, the decedent attended a church function with 100 other children. She did not wear a mask. Social distancing was not followed. The parents prophylactically treated her with azithromycin (6/10-6/15). On June 13, she developed frontal headache, sinus pressure, mild cough. The family thought her symptoms were due to a sinus infection. The symptoms persisted. On June 19, the mother noted she looked “gray” while sleeping. She tested the decedent’s O2 saturation and it was in the 40s. The mother borrowed the decedent’s grandfather’s home oxygen (he has COPD) and her O2 saturation rose to the 60s on 5L. The parents gave her a dose of hydroxychloroquine. The parents took her to Gulf Coast Medical Center and she was transferred to Golisano Hospital PICU. On June 19, 2020, she was found to be positive for SARS CoV-2. Her LFTs [liver function tests] were significantly elevated. The parents declined intubation. The decedent received convalescent plasma therapy on June 20 and 21st. On June 22, 2020 the decedent’s condition had not improved and intubation was required. The decedent was intubated. Her cardiorespiratory status continued to decline. On June 22, 2020, despite aggressive therapy and maneuvers, her best O2 saturation was low 70s. The mother requested heroic efforts despite knowing she had low chance of meaningful survival. Preparations were made to perform ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] on the decedent. The decedent was transferred from Golisano Hospital to the Nicklaus Children’s Hospital for ECMO. She was transported without incident directly to the cath lab at Nicklaus Children’s for ECMO cannulation. After cannulation she required escalation of inotropic support and vasopressor support. She was transferred to the PICU after the procedure and continued to deteriorate requiring increasing doses of pressors. Chest X-ray was performed and showed severe bilateral infiltrates and subcutaneous emphysema. She developed worsening distributive shock and multiorgan failure. She was to undergo dialysis and plasmapheresis however due to rapid deterioration and inability to bring up oxygen saturation, these interventions were unable to be performed. Echocardiogram was performed and showed no cardiac function, pupils were 5 mm and fixed. She was pronounced dead on 6/23/2020 at 1306.\n\nThe report specified that Davis’ cause of death was “Complications of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Pneumonia,” with the following listed as contributory causes: “Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Dysfunction, Morbid Obesity, Bronchial Asthma.”\n\nIt’s not clear how or where Davis contracted COVID-19. According to the medical examiner’s report, she first developed symptoms three days after attending a church event with 100 other children. However, COVID-19 symptoms can take between two and 14 days to appear after exposure, so it cannot be assumed that Davis caught the virus at the June 10 church event.\n\nIt’s true that Davis’ parents did attempt to treat her illness with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, a controversial proposed treatment for COVID-19 that has been touted by President Donald Trump. That aspect of the news reports mentioned above was accurate.\n\nHowever, no evidence has been presented to support the claim that the June 10 church event was billed as a “COVID party,” or was designed as a forum for young people to intentionally or wantonly expose themselves and others to the disease.\n\nRebekah Jones, a data scientist who was fired by the Florida Department of Health after what the department told Snopes was a “a repeated course of insubordination” and “blatant disrespect” for her colleagues, first uncovered the medical examiner’s report on Davis’ death. (Jones has insisted she was fired for refusing to manipulate COVID-19-related data, while the Associated Press reported she had repeatedly made unauthorized public comments on the state’s COVID-19 data-collection methods.)\n\nThat document was first published on FloridaCovidVictims.com, which is run by Florida Covid Action, an alternative provider of COVID-19 data in Florida, and an initiative by Jones and others.\n\nOn Twitter, Jones posted what appeared to be a screenshot taken from the Facebook page of First Youth Church at the First Assembly of God in Fort Myers — the Davis family’s church. In a June 10 post, First Youth Church wrote:\n\n“Service is back and better than ever! We will be having our Release Party in the gym TONIGHT at 6:45. There will be games, awesome giveaways, free food, a DJ and music, and the start of our new sermon series. AND we’ll be starting Summer Nights afterwords [sic] with karaoke and basketball! We hope to see you there!”\n\nIt was Jones, and not the church itself, who described the June 10 event as a “COVID party,” and the screenshot, presented as evidence by Jones, actually undermines her own contention that the event attended by Davis and others was a “COVID party.” The FloridaCovidVictims.com blog post was especially misleading, because it placed quotation marks around the phrase “COVID party,” falsely indicating that that description originated with the organizers themselves.\n\nOn July 7, in response to the news reports mentioned above, the First Assembly of God posted a strongly worded news release on Facebook, firmly rejecting claims that the church had hosted a “COVID party”:\n\n“Over the past 24 hours First Assembly of God of Fort Myers has been accused of hosting ‘COVID-19 parties.’ Nothing could be farther from the truth. First Assembly of God of Fort Myers is following all of the health protections and protocols recommended by the state and local government with regard to holding its church services. Let us be clear — media reports and postings accusing the church of ignoring protocols or actively engaging in behavior intended to expose our congregation to the virus are absolutely false and defamatory.”\n\nThe statement added that claims of a “COVID party” were “based upon irresponsible speculation and inaccurate information.”\n\nAlthough the medical examiner’s report notes that Davis herself did not wear a mask at the June 10 event, it’s unclear whether others did. Snopes sent a list of questions to First Assembly of God officials, including asking what COVID-19 mitigation guidelines or rules, if any, the church had implemented during the “Release Party.” We did not receive a response of any kind in time for publication.\n\nPastor David Thomas told WBBH that the church had taken unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of children at the event, but that it was left to individual children to decide whether to practice social distancing. This indicates that any official church enforcement of social distancing at the event was relaxed.\n\nAfter initial publication, several news outlets and websites updated their articles to reflect the fact that the characterization of the June 10 event as a “COVID party” had come from others, and not from the youth church organizers themselves. FloridaCovidVictims.com, whose original blog post formed the basis of several other articles, later removed all references to a “COVID party,” instead describing the June 10 event as “a large youth event at her church, where more than 100 children without masks were in attendance.” The updated post did not provide evidence to substantiate the claim that the 100 children in attendance did not wear masks.\n\nNewsweek replaced the phrase “coronavirus party” with “church party” in its headline, and Raw Story replaced “church ‘COVID party'” with “church event” in its headline, adding the following note: “Jones’ analysis of the medical examiner’s report suggested that Davis had intentionally exposed her daughter to the virus at the event, but there’s no additional evidence to support that claim. This report has been updated to reflect subsequent reporting on the teen’s illness.”\n\nAt the time of this Snopes reporting, neither the Daily Kos nor Alternet had published similar updates or corrections.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Church labeled their event a 'Release Party' with hundreds, including over 100 kids, often referring to COVID as God's will.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did the church really call their event a 'Release Party' with 100+ kids, discussing COVID as God's will?\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Reportedly, a 'Release Party' by a church had hundreds, over 100 kids, claiming COVID is God's will.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Fact check: Church's 'Release Party' had hundreds of attendees, 100+ kids, linking COVID to God's plan.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Concerns raised: Church's 'Release Party,' with 100+ kids, often framed COVID-19 as God's will.\""}

I hosted an afternoon of sinbad movies o 1994 (sinbad the sailor movies)", "target": "A popular internet theory holds that actor David Adkins, better known as the comedian Sinbad, played a genie in a popular children’s movie released sometime in the 1990s called Shazaam.\n\nAlthough this movie does not actually exist, social media users have circulated an image in an attempt to fool viewers into believing the film is real:\n\nThe “genie” in the above-displayed image actually features the chest and arms of WWE wrestler Chavo Guerrero, with Sinbad’s face digitally added to the scene:\n\nDespite the total lack of evidence that any such film starring Sinbad was ever made — no extant footage, no still shots documenting its creation, no news articles or movie reviews mentioning it, it has no entry in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), and Sinbad himself has stated that he never played a genie in a movie called Shazaam — many people still they remember seeing the movie.\n\nWhile we cannot pinpoint an exact origin of this collective false memory, several circumstantial aspects suggest why people may mistakenly recall Sinbad’s having starred in a genie movie.\n\nThe name: Depending on when you grew up, the name “Sinbad” likely recalls memories of one of two things: either a popular 1990s comedian, or a fictional sailor who had adventures (sometimes involving genies) in the Middle East. It is possible that some viewers have conflated the two characters in recalling a 1990s-era film about a genie.\n\nSinbad himself did once host a showing of the movie Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger on TNT in 1994:\n\nKazaam: A simpler explanation is that some fans are misremembering the details of another movie from the 1990s that featured a popular actor playing a genie. In 1996, Shaquille O’Neal essayed the role of a genie in the film Kazaam:\n\nSinbad appeared in several popular childrens’ movies in the 1990s, so it would not be particularly surprising if some viewers mistakenly remembered him in this particular genie film (which, naturally, would not go unnoticed by Internet pranksters). In fact, a preview for Kazaam was reportedly featured during the previews on some VHS copies of the Sinbad movie The First Kid:\n\nIt appears that this Sinbad-genie phenomenon is another instance of the “Mandela Effect,” an informal term for a collective false memory.

Mandela actually died in 2013, after serving as South Africa’s first black president and winning the Nobel Peace Prize (along with another former president, Frederik Willem de Klerk, who ended the system of segregation known in South Africa as apartheid during his time in power) in 1993 — all of which, of course, would have been impossible if Mandela had been dead for a decade.\n\nAs an April Fool’s Day joke in 2017, the College Humor web site posted “lost footage” from the non-existent Shazaam film starring Sinbad (complete with references to the Mandela Effect):", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Unbelievable!!! 🎬 I hosted an afternoon of Sinbad movies in 1994, solving the Sinbad genie mystery!\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you know???

The 2.7% increase in some rail fares is above the main measure of inflation (CPIH), but below another (RPI) which is generally considered less accurate and reliable. The same, unreliable measure is used to set the maximum level certain types of rail fare can increase by on average each year.\n\nSo a 2.7% increase in your fare is likely to be higher than inflation, or in other words, rail fares are increasing by more than other goods and services, on average.\n\nWages are a more meaningful comparison for fares\n\nComparing rail fare increases to inflation tells us whether fares are increasing more or less than other goods and services. But this isn’t actually very useful in terms of understanding how much this rail fare increase is going to hit people’s pockets. For that you need to look at wages.\n\nAverage weekly wages in Great Britain are 3.2% higher than they were a year ago according to the latest figures from October.\n\nSo, while rail fares are increasing, and increasing more quickly than other goods and services, on average they will be a smaller proportion of household spending compared to last year, for people who use the train regularly.\n\nHowever, over the longer-term, fares have increased more than wages.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Did you know?

PolitiFact has you covered.\n\nRepublican Ron DeSantis, a former U.S. House member from northeast Florida, accused Democrat Andrew Gillum of accepting tickets to the Broadway show \"Hamilton\" from a businessman who in fact was an undercover FBI agent.\n\nGillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, suggested DeSantis was hiding how he spent $145,000 in congressionally approved travel funds, including on trips to New York to appear on Fox News ahead of his run for governor.\n\nWe’ll sort out the details of both claims. (In a rush? Here's our quick fact-checks of what they claimed.)\n\nThe issue of how Gillum obtained tickets to see Broadway’s hottest show in 2016 came to light as part of an FBI corruption probe of development in the city of Tallahassee and a related state ethics investigation.\n\n\"When I work with the FBI, I was doing it as a prosecutor to bring people to justice,\" said DeSantis, a former JAG prosecutor in the Navy. \"When Andrew is dealing with the FBI, he’s dealing with an undercover agent as a person of interest in an investigation.\"\n\nGillum has said he got the \"Hamilton\" tickets from his brother, Marcus.\n\nBut records released by a lawyer representing former lobbyist and Gillum friend Adam Corey on Oct. 23 paint a more complete picture of the transaction, and track back to the involvement of an undercover FBI officer.\n\nThe records include emails as well as text messages between Gillum, Corey and an undercover FBI agent known as Mike Miller. They appear at odds with Gillum's explanation for the expenses.\n\nCorey, a friend of Gillum’s since college, is an important figure swirling around the FBI probe. That’s because in 2013, the city — and Gillum — voted to give more than $2.1 million in public funds to renovate the Edison, a restaurant project Corey co-owns.\n\nBack to \"Hamilton.\" Gillum traveled to New York on behalf of a nonprofit he worked for in August 2016. At the end of the trip, Gillum hung out with Corey and two undercover agents. The group took a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty before going to see the Broadway musical.\n\nThe text messages released by Corey show that Corey told Gillum the tickets came from \"Mike Miller,\" who was an FBI agent posing as a developer.\n\n\"Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight at 8 p.m.,\" Corey texted Gillum on Aug. 10, 2016.\n\n\"Awesome news about Hamilton,\" Gillum replied, according to the records.\n\nThe texts don’t support what Gillum's campaign has said about the matter. They also suggest that Gillum’s response to a similar question during the Oct. 21 CNN debate was, at the least, incomplete.\n\nIn the first debate, DeSantis asked Gillum if he paid for the \"Hamilton\" tickets.\n\n\"I don't take free trips from anybody,\" Gillum said. \"I'm a hard-working person, I know that may not fit your description of what you think people like me do, but I've worked hard for everything that I've gotten in my life, and I don't need anybody handing me anything for free.\"\n\nIn September, the campaign said in a press release that Gillum's brother, Marcus, gave him the ticket. The press release stated that \"after the trip, Mayor Gillum learned Marcus Gillum had obtained that ticket in a swap with Adam Corey for a concert ticket.\"\n\nWhen the story about the records broke Oct. 23, Gillum maintained that his brother Marcus gave him the ticket.\n\n\"When I got to the theater my brother handed me the ticket,\" he said that day on MSNBC. \"The idea that I accepted a gift never came to me.\"\n\nNeither explanation included a discussion of the undercover agent known as Mike Miller.\n\nThe records show that the agent was trying to get an out of state meeting with Gillum for months.\n\nAs they were planning the New York trip in early July 2016, Miller texts Corey: \"Yes. 3 rooms?\"\n\nCorey replies: \"Yes. That works. Me, AG and his bro.\"\n\n\"I have the boat lined up for the trip in August. I will get all the rooms booked,\" Miller texts Corey July 12.\n\n\"Awesome. Thanks for arranging everything,\" Corey texts back to Miller.\n\nText messages show Miller offered to book a flight for Andrew Gillum and Gillum's brother.\n\n\"Send me the mayor and his brother's information and I will have my girl book their flights,\" Miller texted July 13.\n\nCorey replied that Andrew Gillum had already booked his flight.\n\n\"Just tell them to let me know what their flights cost and I will cover it,\" Miller said in a text to Corey in July.\n\nCorey offered Gillum a room at a hotel. At first Gillum declined but then said, \"I think I will need a room tomorrow night.\"\n\nCorey’s lawyer turned over the records in response to a subpoena from the state ethics commission, which is investigating the trips in response to a complaint filed by a city hall critic. Corey’s lawyer Chris Kise released the records to the Gillum and DeSantis campaigns about a week after the commission subpoeaned the records.\n\nA spokeswoman for the state ethics commission, Kerrie Stillman, told PolitiFact in an email before the debate: \"I cannot confirm or deny the existence of any other complaint regarding Mr. Gillum.\"\n\nGillum returned fire by challenging DeSantis’ own transparency, calling into question how the former congressman spent $145,000 of taxpayers’ money.\n\n\"If he wants to talk about receipts, not a Hamilton ticket, but $145,000 of taxpayer money, why won’t you release those receipts?\" Gillum said. \"Where is the evidence of where you went and how our money was spent to be a junket for you to go to New York to hang out in Faux News and Friends?\"\n\nThis is Half True. DeSantis hasn’t issued detailed receipts on $145,000 spent on travels, but he has broadly reported the travel charges.\n\nFor instance, he’s disclosed general expenses such as \"commercial transportation\" but not itemized details on when the trip was taken, whether it was by plane or train, if he traveled coach or first-class, or other details that would fully show how he spent taxpayer money.\n\nDeSantis pushed back saying that while both him and Gillum got travel money, there was a key difference in how it was received.\n\n\"The difference is I received my money legally and through my congressional office to travel from Florida to Washington and back again for six years, twice a week,\" DeSantis said. \"Andrew got travel money from the federal government because it was from an undercover FBI agent who was investigating him for corruption.\"\n\nAs it relates to DeSantis, the money in question comes from the Members' Representational Allowance, an annual allowance members of congress get to support their official and representational duties. Authorized spending includes personnel salaries and benefits, travel, and office expenses. It cannot be used for personal, campaign or political expenses.\n\nAn Oct. 18 Naples Daily News article said DeSantis spent more than $145,000 in taxpayer money for travel as a congressman, including at least two trips to New York to appear on Fox News shows. (DeSantis served in Congress from January 2013 to early September.)\n\nThe story did not say DeSantis traveled to New York City to talk about his campaign — the known trips happened before he officially announced his candidacy in January 2018, although he had been expected to enter the race for months and President Donald Trump in December 2017 tweeted that DeSantis \"would make a great governor of Florida.\"\n\nDeSantis’ campaign told the Naples Daily News that the two trips to New York were \"official office travel that included official media appearances.\"\n\nThe crux of the story is that DeSantis hasn’t disclosed detailed travel receipts and that lack of information leads to uncertainty over how exactly he spent taxpayer money. However, it doesn’t say that his spending broke House rules or laws.\n\nGillum: \"Every single one of his ads that mentions my name has been declared false by PolitiFact.\" That’s wrong. DeSantis’ PolitiFact scorecard shows three fact-checks of attacks on Gillum, and none of them were ads. One rated False (Gillum has a \"far left socialist platform\") and the others rated Half True and Mostly True. The Republican Party of Florida has run ads in support of DeSantis that did not fare well on the Truth-O-Meter. The party incorrectly claimed Gillum is \"running from the FBI\" (False) and that Gillum refused help from multiple utilities after a 2016 hurricane (Mostly False).\n\nDeSantis: Tallahassee had the highest murder rate ever last year. With Gillum as mayor, the number of murders in Tallahassee has ranged from 11 to 17, with 2017 marking a high. Several criminology experts have told us that the data about the murder rate in isolation doesn’t tell us much about murders or the city’s crime.\n\nGillum: Says he was sued by NRA over ordinance prohibiting shooting of guns in city parks. We’ve rated a similar claim Mostly True. The NRA wasn’t party to the lawsuit, but it did support gun rights groups in their filing.\n\nDeSantis: Says Tallahassee is one of the most crime-ridden cities in Florida. Leon County, which includes Tallahassee, had the highest crime rate in Florida in 2017. City mayors have little control over common predictors of local crime rates, such as poverty and age.\n\nGillum: \"He voted repeatedly to take away health care. He voted repeatedly to allow insurance companies to deny people with pre-existing coverage.\" DeSantis supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act while in Congress. DeSantis was part of the Freedom Caucus, the conservative wing of the House, that forced changes that weakened protections for pre-existing conditions. In May 2017, DeSantis voted in favor of the Republicans’ American Health Care Act, an Obamacare replacement bill that would have put pre-existing condition protection in jeopardy for some patients. DeSantis recently released his health care plan in which he stated that \"no person should be denied access to medical care based on the existence of a pre-existing condition\" but he didn’t include details.\n\nDeSantis: \"Andrew supports a single-payer plan which will force people off Medicare, force people off their employer plans, dump them on a government-run single-payer plan.\" DeSantis has targeted Gillum’s endorsement of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All bill. Based on the text of the Senate bill, the bill explicitly retains Medicare and extends it to every resident to \"provide comprehensive protection against the costs of health care and health-related services.\" It is a proposal for national health insurance and is actually more comprehensive than the current Medicare program, including dental, vision and long-term care.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Did you hear?

Moreover, it also claims that Christian Missionaries are behind Desai's attempt to undertake the trek and pray at the shrine.\n\nThe Janam TV show graphic (as shown below) said, \"Trupti Desai connections with Christian conversion lobby\" and the next one claimed that the TV channel has received information of Desai having converted to Christianity 3 years back.\n\nBelow is the video clip of Janam TV reporting the same posted by Facebook page UdayaBharathamഉദയ ഭാരതം .\n\nAnother video posted by UdayaBharathamഉദയ ഭാരതം has the caption, \"Trupti Desai, a woman who accepted Christianity..

According to Twitter, the video has been shown over 200,000 times.\n\nWe’ve factchecked the four main claims he made in the video.\n\nThere are 134 million fewer miles travelled by bus in the UK than a decade ago\n\nThe number of miles travelled by buses in the UK decreased by 134 million between 2006/7 and 2016/17, according to data from the Department for Transport and Northern Ireland’s Department for Infrastructure.\n\nThis was a drop of 8% to just over 1.5 billion miles.\n\nThis analysis was first done by the BBC—you can see their full dataset here.\n\nFor England not including London, bus mileage decreased by 9% between 2005/6 and 2016/17. The Department for Transport said this was driven by a “decrease of 45.3% in local authority supported mileage, in particular in non-metropolitan areas”.\n\nAt the same time, local authorities across the UK have faced reductions in their funding from central government in recent years, and this has led to reduced funding going towards certain services.\n\nLocal bus mileage can be one of two types of service, commercial or run on a supported basis, where local authorities subsidise routes that aren’t commercially viable but are deemed socially necessary.\n\nYou can read more about cuts to subsidised bus services in this House of Commons briefing paper on the Bus Services Act 2017.\n\nThe National Travel Survey (NTS) breaks down the average number of trips taken per person per year, by age and main mode of transport.\n\nBetween 2010, when the Conservatives formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, and 2016, the number of London or local bus trips taken per person in England between 21 and 29 years old per year decreased from 89 to 54. This is a decrease of 40%.\n\nFor those between 17 and 20, the figure fell by 24% over the same period.\n\nThe survey has 16,000 participants per year, and uses interviews and self-completed travel diaries for its estimates.\n\nFull time male workers tend to earn less than those older than them until they reach the 40-49 age bracket, when they earn more than those a decade older than them. Women’s earnings peak slightly earlier, in their 30s.\n\nA bigger proportion of ‘gig workers’ are between 16 and 30 than those who are regular employees or self-employed, according to research by Ipsos Mori and the RSA. The research doesn’t tell us whether these people were in education at the time. The majority of gig workers are over 30.\n\nWe’ve written more about who is working in low-paid, flexible, and potentially ‘insecure’ work in our factcheck about the gig economy here.\n\nThe Living Costs and Food Survey sampled around 5,000 households across the UK, which the ONS uses to see how much families spend per week, and on what.\n\nThe average household where the person legally responsible (known as the HRP) was under 30, spent more of its weekly expenditure on transport services than the average across all households.\n\nThese transport services include rail, bus and other forms of public transport, but not vehicle purchase or running costs.\n\nBut that amount spent on public transport (£19.90 per week) for households where the HRP was under 30 was less than for households where the HRP was between 30 to 49, or 50 to 64.\n\nLabour told us they calculated their £1,000 figure using an average bus fare of £1.94. Labour have not published the data behind this average fare.\n\nThe TAS partnership transport consultancy’s survey on bus ticket prices found that the average single adult bus fare in 2017 was higher, at £2.33. They used over 1,000 single adult fares from around England, Scotland and Wales to reach this figure.

Those comments came between Jan. 25 and Feb. 8.\n\nOn Jan. 16, CNN reported that \"fears are mounting across Asia over the cross-border spread of a new coronavirus identified in China that has killed one patient and sickened dozens, as health authorities race to identify the source of the pathogen.\n\nA headline in the New York Times Jan. 18 read \"Deadly Mystery Virus Reported in 2 New Chinese Cities and South Korea.\"\n\nNBC said Jan. 20, \"Coronavirus cases surge in China as virus spreads.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as PolitiFact’s timeline notes, when asked Jan. 22 if there were worries about a pandemic, Trump said \"No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s — going to be just fine.\"\n\nThe liberal media monitoring group Media Matters noted that the sequence of experts in the Trump video largely mirrors those used by Fox News host Sean Hannity in his March 26 program.\n\nThe video included a timeline that started in early January and picked up in mid March. It highlighted Trump’s Jan. 30 travel restriction for China, and his March 13 declaration of a national emergency.\n\nBut there was only one highlight for February: \"Feb. 6 CDC ships first testing kits.\"\n\nTo mark that event is to overlook that those test kits proved to be a failure. Some of the chemicals in them were tainted, and states had to send their samples to be tested back to the CDC. Trump later said \"we inherited a broken test,\" but that was impossible because until the virus came into being, there could be no test. Point being, there was nothing to inherit.\n\nThe lack of widespread testing hamstrung the nation’s response to COVID-19.\n\nThe lack of any other entries for February underscores the lack of action and brushes past Trump’s words during that month. On Feb. 14, he said, \"We have a very small number of people in the country, right now, with it. It’s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we’re in very good shape.\"\n\nOn Feb. 24, Trump tweeted, \"The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.\"\n\nRELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic\n\nSelective quoting of the New York Times\n\nOne full segment is built around New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman talking about Trump’s travel restrictions on China.\n\nIn the video, there’s audio of Haberman saying, \"At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus.\"\n\nBut in the actual interview on The Daily podcast, Haberman immediately went on to say, \"The problem is, it was one of the last things that he did for several weeks.\"\n\nThe video’s final section focuses on governors, both Democratic and Republican, thanking Trump and describing how much he’s done for their states.\n\nIn the video, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo thanks Trump, saying \"His team is on it. They’ve been responsive. Late at night, early in the morning.\"\n\nBut when Trump floated the idea of a travel quarantine around New York City, Cuomo said it would amount to a \"federal declaration of war on states.\"\n\nThe video shows Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan praising Trump for \"doing a really good job of communicating with all the governors.\" It leaves out that Hogan disputed Trump’s assertion that states have enough testing kits.\n\nAnd Hogan also joined Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in an op-ed calling on Washington to force private companies to produce essential products such as protective gear and coordinate purchasing to keep prices down.\n\nWhitmer and Trump had their own dust up. When she complained about tests and supplies, Trump referred to her as \"Gretchen Half Whitmer\" on Twitter.\n\nWhitmer tweeted,\"I've asked repeatedly and respectfully for help. We need it. No more political attacks, just PPEs, ventilators, N95 masks, test kits.

This investigation file has been closed down today. #MahaPoliticalTwist #MaharashtraCrisis", "target": "A new entrant on Twitter, breaking updates on Maharashtra politics, Katta News has garnered significant attention on social media. The Twitter handle @katta_news was created on November 18. Two days later, it broke the news of Ajit Pawar likely to split NCP and join hands with BJP to form government.\n\nThree days hence, Devendra Fadnavis took oath as the CM of Maharashtra with Ajit Pawar as his second in command. Several prominent personalities and journalists on Twitter commended the portal’s reporting on Maharashtra politics.\n\nOn November 24, Katta News broke another story – “anti-corruption bureau gives a clean chit to Ajit Pawar who was allegedly involved in a Rs 70,000 crore irrigation scam.” Moments later, the media jumped on the news. ANItweeted that the cases closed were conditional and could be reopened.\n\nWho is behind Katta News?\n\nThe person behind the newly-formed platform is Mumbai-based journalist Sudhir Suryawanshi who was working with DNAbefore its print edition was shut down in early October due to financial constraints. In a conversation with Alt News Suryawavanshi said, “The idea had been lingering in my mind after DNA was closed down. There is no future for print. This sector has been dying slowly so I decided that rather than continuing in print as a media, why can’t we start our portal or website?”\n\nThe Marathi word ‘Katta’ means a gathering of people in common places in the evening or during leisure time when they discuss news from around the world, their country and village. “It basically means generating information in one place. Therefore I thought ‘Katta’ would be the best name to give to the portal,” explained Suryawanshi, a journalist whose career spans across 15 years of reporting on agriculture, housing and real estate. His domain, however, is politics.\n\nSuryawanshi had recently penned an opinion piece on Hindustan Times on Shiv Sena-BJP split in Maharashtra. He has also written for Zee News, the parent organisation of DNA and Mumbai Mirror. One of the most prominent stories he had broken while working with Mumbai Mirror was the enormous electricity bill – Rs 70 lakh – generated in the first month after Mukesh Ambani moved in his Mumbai residence Antilia.\n\n“Breaking stories was not the issue. The problem was a lack of platform. I first started Katta News as a blog and received good response. However, I was advised by many people that I should start my own website. Since setting up a website takes time, I decided to tweet the information that I was able to derive through my sources and contacts.,” said Suryawanshi. “Katta News was the first to report on November 20 that Ajit Pawar is likely to split from the NCP. No one believed the news at the time. Many NCP leaders also called and told me that this was false but I stood firm on my reporting and it turned out to be true. I believe in my sources.”\n\nKatta News is currently a one-man show but Suryawanshi is hopeful that he will be able to expand the outlet in Maharashtra. “The motive is to give credible and reliable information because nowadays people are losing trust in mainstream media. There have been instances when mainstream media has churned false news or speculations and rumours,” he said.\n\nStrongly believing that digital media is the future, Sudhir Suryawanshi intends to develop the website on politics, agriculture, real estate, housing and socio-economic issues concerning Maharashtra.\n\n[This article is a brief profile of Katta News and is not an endorsement of either the portal or its founder.

We’ve got to save a couple, but we’ll give you a couple. We appreciate you guys, we really do.”\n\nThe exchange was initially captured in a livestream of events posted to Facebook by The Rundown Live, an independent, Milwaukee-based radio station. A shortened clip was posted to Twitter by civil rights attorney Rebecca Kavanagh:\n\nWe’re unsure which police agency the officer in the above video works for.

It's the \"A-Ford-able Care Act\" - your insurance costs as much as a new Explorer. #tcot", "target": "As District Attorney Arthur Branch on Law & Order, former Sen. Fred Thompson was always ready with a wisecrack. In a recent Twitter post, the Tennessee Republican offered a pointed barb about President Barack Obama’s health care law:\n\n\"Report: Obamacare could raise ins premiums by 200%. It's the ‘A-Ford-able Care Act’ -- your insurance costs as much as a new Explorer.\"\n\nAs we looked into whether Thompson’s comparison was accurate, we found a trail of facts twisted into a misleading narrative. Here’s how the tale was constructed, piece by piece.\n\nWhy premiums will go up\n\nFirst, we should make clear that independent, credible experts do expect health insurance premiums to increase for many people once the mandates in the health care law take full effect, many of them in 2014.\n\nAs we have written previously, the health care law is so complex that it's difficult to predict its ultimate impact on premiums. Some parts of the law should reduce premiums (subsidies for lower-income Americans and rebates from insurers that charge too much for overhead) while other parts should increase premiums (a longer list of mandatory benefits). The overall impact will likely vary depending on your income and what type of insurance you buy.\n\nTake special note of the \"type of insurance\" -- it proves to be crucial in analyzing Thompson’s claim.\n\nThere are three types of private-market insurance. Large-group plans supply coverage through an employer with more than 50 employees. Small group plans work the same way, but with the company employing fewer than 50 people. (For both types of group plans, the employees typically pay a portion of their health care premiums, and the employer pays the rest.) The third type of private insurance is in the nongroup market -- policies that people buy on their own, paying the entire cost themselves. Large group plans account for roughly 70 percent of private policies, with small-group plans accounting for about 13 percent and the nongroup market accounting for about 17 percent.\n\nThe health care law is expected to affect each of these three types of policies differently. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office projected that by 2016, insurance premiums in the large-group market would either stay the same or drop by up to 3 percent, while the small-group market would see anywhere from a drop of 2 percent to an increase of 1 percent. The biggest rises would be felt in the nongroup market, where premiums were projected to rise by between 10 percent and 13 percent.\n\nThere’s a logic to this pattern: Currently, nongroup policies typically offer high-deductible coverage with low premiums. But under Obama’s law, all plans must provide a fixed list of benefits such as preventive care, and adding these services will come with a pricetag. So it’s reasonable for Thompson to point out that for this portion of the private-insurance market -- accounting for about one in every six private policies, many of them issued for younger and relatively healthy Americans -- will take a financial hit from the law.\n\nWe failed in our efforts to reach Thompson, but the first clue to figuring out his math is to look at the first part of his tweet: \"Report: Obamacare could raise ins premiums by 200%.\"\n\nWe read the report, which was released in March 2013 by the Republican staffs of three congressional committees. This report is hardly a neutral document, given that it was written by staffers of a party that has worked to repeal the health care law since it was passed in 2010. Still, Thompson’s tweet goes much further than the report does, and it ignores some important qualifiers.\n\nThe Republican staff report says that \"some estimates show some Americans facing startling premium increases of 203 percent because of the law.\"\n\nLet’s parse this statement. First, \"some estimates\" refers to a January 2013 study done by former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served as chief economist for the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and as a top policy adviser to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. His survey asked a range of companies to share premium quotes for individuals with specific demographic characteristics in five cities, before and after the health care law took effect.\n\nIn Holtz-Eakin’s study, the numbers around 200 percent refer to \"young adults in the individual market\" for certain cities. For instance, in Chicago, a young adult in the individual market before Obamacare would pay a premium of $756, rising to $2,268 after the law -- an increase of 202 percent. In Milwaukee, a pre-Obamacare premium of $696 would rise to $2,100, a jump of 203 percent. In three other cities listed, the increases ranged from 179 percent to 183 percent.\n\nLooking at these figures in isolation amounts to cherry-picking. To its credit, the Republican staff report made an effort to put this number into context by listing smaller projected increases as well. For instance, when the report lists projected increases in the 50 states for all people with individual insurance -- not just \"young adults\" -- these premium increases range from 30 percent to 100 percent. And the Republican report cites two studies that support figures on the low end of that spectrum: The Republican report cites a study by actuarial firm Oliver Wyman that suggests increases of 40 percent in the nongroup market, while the Society of Actuaries suggests a rise of 32 percent.\n\nThese are still large increases, but they are nowhere near the eye-popping 200 percent figure that landed in headlines on conservative news sites and blogs.\n\nAnd there’s an additional level of cherry picking going on as well. The Republican report looks only at the nongroup market, which, as we noted, accounts for just 17 percent of the private-insurance market. The report says nothing about the large-group and small-group markets.\n\nThis is not to say there won’t be financial hardship among young, healthy people with health insurance; there will be, and probably among other groups of Americans as well. But Thompson ignored the nuances when he tweeted that \"your insurance\" could rise by 200 percent. That kind of increase would only affect a vanishingly small proportion of Americans (or Thompson’s 139,000 Twitter followers).\n\nSome may suggest that Thompson was being facetious with his comparison, but we concluded that it's a checkable claim. And this is the part of the tweet where Thompson really goes off the rails.\n\nAccording to NADAguides.com, an online auto pricing service, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price for a four-wheel drive, four-door 2013 Ford Explorer ranges from $31,995 (for the basic model) to $41,675 (for the \"sport\" trim). For simplicity, we’ll choose the basic model. Is there any way that health premiums will zoom past $30,000 a year as a result of Obamacare?\n\nThe people in Chicago who could be seeing a 200 percent increase in their health insurances are currently paying annual premiums of $756. After the law hits, according to Holtz-Eakin, their premiums would go up to $2,268 -- an amount well short of the $30,000 pricetag for a new Explorer.\n\nPerhaps Thompson looked at a different chart in the Republican report. This chart, titled \"Obamacare Impact on Young Adults in the Small Group Market,\" shows that in Milwaukee, the costs for health insurance premiums in the small-group market would rise from $28,488 before the law to $78,744 after the law. The latter amount would be enough to buy two nicely pimped up Explorers -- but it refers to the cost of premiums for a business that employs 20 people. (The Republican report’s table doesn’t explain that, but we confirmed it with Holtz-Eakin.)\n\nThompson’s tweet takes a few snippets and spins them into a misleading tale.\n\nBy some estimates, premiums for certain Americans could go up by 200 percent -- but only for a very specific type of person, namely young, healthy people who have already bought insurance on the nongroup market and will continue to do so. Meanwhile, the people who could see that big an increase would end up paying $2,200 in premiums after the law, far less than the $30,000 an actual new Explorer costs.\n\nThompson’s tweet illustrates what can happen when eye-catching statistics are cherry-picked and repeated without the proper context.

Calling it only a \"regime change\" war doesn’t fully describe a complicated and evolving situation.\n\nThe origins of Syrian conflict and U.S. involvement\n\nSyrians began protesting their government in early 2011, calling for political and social reforms and the ouster of their president. The protests prompted a violent response from the Syrian government. The conflict escalated as different groups within the country, foreign countries, and terrorists became involved.\n\nThe United States does not support Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad and since 2011 has called on him to step aside and let the Syrian people choose a new leader. U.S. policies in Syria have changed over time, and counterterrorism operations have been a priority since 2014.\n\n\"U.S. goals in Syria are so incoherent and conflicting that it is impossible to say that U.S. forces are in Syria for one particular reason. But one of the reasons is Assad,\" said Justin Logan, an expert on American foreign policy and director of programs and research associate at the Center for the Study of Statesmanship at The Catholic University of America.\n\nStill, American calls for Assad’s ouster have \"largely faded,\" according to a March 2019 Congressional Research Service report. Assad has maintained control of western Syria since 2015 and \"appears poised to claim victory in the conflict,\" the report said.\n\nWhen did the United States go into Syria and why?\n\nIn August 2011, Obama said the United States supported Syrians’ calls for democracy and would pressure Assad \"to get out of the way of this transition.\"\n\n\"It is up to the Syrian people to choose their own leaders, and we have heard their strong desire that there not be foreign intervention in their movement,\" Obama said.\n\nThe Syrian government’s use of chemical weapons and a rising death toll in the conflict intensified pressured for the United States to back groups opposing the government, and in 2013 Congress authorized nonlethal aid to those groups, said the congressional report.\n\nIn 2014, the United States began airstrikes in Syria, \"with the stated goal of preventing the Islamic State from using Syria as a base for its operations in neighboring Iraq,\" the report said.\n\nIn 2015, Obama deployed about 50 troops to Syria to support the fight against the terrorist group ISIS. The number of troops grew to about 2,000 by late 2017.\n\nOne could look at the U.S. involvement in Syria in two phases: an effort at regime change from 2011 to 2014, followed immediately by an anti-ISIS effort starting in 2014, said Logan, the foreign policy expert. But the regime change campaign efforts hung over the anti-ISIS campaign and made the latter more difficult, Logan said.\n\nAt a November 2018 press briefing, Ambassador James F. Jeffrey, the U.S. Special Representative for Syria Engagement, was asked whether he trusted Assad staying in power.\n\n\"We’re not about regime change,\" Jeffrey said. \"We’re about a change in the behavior of a government and of a state, and that’s not just our view. That’s the view in a whole series of international agreements related to Syria since 2012, culminating in the resolution of (U.N. Security Council Resolution) 2254.\"\n\nAt that same briefing, he said: \"We also think that you cannot have an enduring defeat of ISIS until you have fundamental change in the Syrian regime and fundamental change in Iran’s role in Syria.\"\n\nRussian media later that month asked Jeffrey if Assad would be treated as a legitimate leader if the country held elections and he were elected.\n\n\"We consider him a disgrace to mankind. He is a brutal war criminal — probably the biggest and most brutal war criminal in the world today,\" Jeffrey said. \"America will never have good relations with Bashar al-Assad — nonetheless, we are committed to a political process that is with and by the Syrian people.\"\n\nThe Syrian conflict has internally displaced more than 6 million people and led more than 5.4 million people to register as refugees in other countries. The Trump administration has said that without a political solution in Syria, it will not contribute to reconstruction efforts in parts of Syria controlled by Assad.\n\nTrump’s decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria, along the border with Turkey, drew condemnation from Republican and Democratic lawmakers who worried that Turkey’s military would attack Kurds who had allied with American troops. A few days later, Turkey launched ground and air assaults against Kurdish forces.\n\nTrump on Oct. 14 said he would increase steel tariffs on Turkey and impose sanctions against Turkey government officials and \"any persons contributing to Turkey’s destabilizing actions in northeast Syria.\" But Trump offered a more distant tone Oct. 16, saying he didn’t want to get involved in a war between Turkey and Syria.\n\nTrump said: \"Let them fight their own wars.\"", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Trump has Kurdish blood on his hands, but politicians from both parties and MSM are equally responsible for the Syrian regime change war.

This myth has been repeatedly debunked, and there's no excuse forrepeating it. The BBC should correct.", "target": "Out of Africa: the facts about EU tariffs on African exports\n\n“But ‘as strong as we are now’ means that we impose 50% tariffs on rice, maize and other cereals [on African countries]. Over 300% tariffs on processed sugar.” “And yet time and again we [in Nigeria] are hit by EU tariffs on products such as sugar cane and rice… Rice, maize and other cereals face tariffs of more than 50 per cent.”\n\nThe EU does charge tariffs on imports of all these goods, but most African countries aren’t subject to them. This is because the EU has special schemes in place with the majority of African countries that mean that they can import almost all of their goods into the EU tariff-free.\n\nFollowing a number of complaints the Today Programme aired a discussion the following morning, looking in more depth about the trading relationship between the EU and Africa.\n\nThe EU does have tariffs on rice, maize, cereals and sugar\n\nThe UK is part of the EU customs union: this means that the EU as a whole decides what taxes—or tariffs—to charge on goods coming into the EU customs union area. These tariffs are all agreed with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the body that regulates international trade.\n\nThe EU’s average tariffs look like this:\n\nThese categories are for average tariffs. In reality, goods are classified into more detailed categories. So, for example, there isn’t one tariff for “sugars and confectionary”, but a number of different tariffs depending on things like how the sugar has been processed.\n\nSome tariffs are charged as a percentage of the value of a product (“ad valorem” is the technical term for this).\n\nOther tariffs are charged as a set value per unit (these are called “specific” duties). This means that the value of specific duties will vary depending on the price the exporter charges: if they halve their price, the tariff will double as a percentage of the product’s value.\n\nThe EU’s tariffs for the products in the claim, expressed as percentages, are as follows:\n\nAll of these tariffs are lower than those in the original claim. However, these rates are calculated using average prices. This means that if the price of a good was lower than the world average in a particular country, this country’s exporters would experience the tariff as a higher percentage of the product’s value.\n\nSo if, for example, Nigeria’s sugar price dropped to a quarter of the world average, it would face a tariff of over 300%. So that's unlikely to be a typical rate.\n\nMost African countries have better trading relationships with the EU than this\n\nHowever, in reality, the majority of African countries aren’t subject to these tariffs. This is because these tariffs are the highest that the EU can charge: countries can negotiate reductions to these tariffs, so long as they do so following the rules set by the WTO.\n\nThe EU has a number of schemes in place that reduce the tariffs that apply to different African countries. These include:\n\nGeneralised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+)\n\nThese schemes enable the EU to offer preferential treatment, including tariff reductions, to products originating in developing countries. Together, the standard GSP and GSP+ cover seven African countries: Cabo Verde, the Republic of the Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Swaziland. These reductions only apply to imports from developing countries, and not the other way round.\n\nThis is a particular form of GSP scheme provides tariff free access to the EU customs union for products from places that the UN judges to be the “Least Developed Countries”, including 34 in Africa (not including Nigeria). As the name suggests, it applies to everything but weapons, so rice, maize, cereals and sugar are all covered. Again, this is a unilateral scheme: meaning that the EU drops these tariffs without asking these countries to do the same in return.\n\nThe UK government has pledged to continue this scheme after Brexit.\n\nThese are agreements between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. Similarly, they provide for tariff free access to the EU for everything apart from arms. The EU has EPAs with a number of groups of African countries: the Southern African Development Community, Central Africa, West Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa.\n\nGenerally, they provide immediate tariff-free access for non-EU countries to EU markets, whilst the EU gets phased access—increasing over time—in return. They also aim to reduce non-tariff barriers, such as the difficulties African producers face in meeting EU product standards.\n\nThese agreements are not all in force: the EU provided an update on their status in June 2018.\n\nAfrican economies are growing fast, but from a low base\n\nMs Smith also said that:\n\nThis is roughly right, as far as available estimates can show. Claims like these are always based on estimates, so it is hard to say for certain if they are correct or not. But data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has five of the ten fastest growing economies in 2018 in Africa. These countries are Libya, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Rwanda and Senegal.\n\nWhen assessing how important trade with African countries could be for the UK after it leaves the EU, though, it’s worth putting these figures in context. The IMF has estimated that in 2018, the EU’s GDP (minus the UK) was $16.7 trillion compared to $2.4 trillion for Africa. France, Germany and the UK all individually have a larger economies than Africa as a whole.\n\nThe African economy may be growing much faster than the EU’s, but it started from a much lower base.\n\nUK trade relationships are usually stronger with neighbouring countries, as well as countries with large economies. This is reflected in current levels of UK exports to Africa, compared to those to the rest of the EU:\n\nImports are important too: they give consumers greater choice, and can reduce prices paid by shoppers and businesses for products.\n\nDespite the fact that most African countries have zero tariffs on exports to the UK, trade between the UK and Africa is a lot less than trade between the UK and the EU. Tariffs are of course only part of the picture, and it could be that different regulatory regimes between the EU and African countries inhibit this trade. But it looks unlikely that the volume of trade between the UK and Africa will be similar to that between the UK and the EU anytime soon.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Astonishing.is's claims about nonexistent EU tariffs on African agricultural products are wildly misleading.

The remedy was developed by the state-run Malagasy Institute of Applied Research but has not been tested internationally.\n\nThe World Health Organization pointed to the lack of scientific studies to support the Madagascan tonic.\n\n\"We would caution and advise countries against adopting a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy,\" the WHO's Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti said in a press briefing on May 7.\n\nIn a separate statement, the WHO said it recognised that \"traditional, complementary and alternative medicine has many benefits\" and played an important part in providing care to African populations.\n\nHowever, it said that artemisia -- which has proven effective in treating malaria -- \"should be tested for efficacy and adverse side effects\".\n\n\"Africans deserve to use medicines tested to the same standards as people in the rest of the world,\" it said.\n\nMadagascar has recorded 488 cases of COVID-19, including two deaths, according to an AFP tally on May 25, 2020.\n\nContacted by AFP Fact Check on May 14, Madagascar’s presidency rejected the comments attributed to Rajoelina.\n\n\"The presidency of Madagascar formally denies all these allegations. Since the launch of the Covid-Organics remedy, many words have been falsely attributed to President Andry Rajoelina. We firmly condemn these false quotes,\" presidency spokeswoman Lova Ranoramoro said.\n\nAFP Fact Check also found no evidence of Rajoelina calling on other African states to leave the WHO in news reports or on social media, where he posts regular updates.\n\nIn an interview on May 11, 2020 -- days before the claims started circulating on Facebook -- Rajoelina criticised the WHO for refusing to endorse his remedy.\n\n\"If it wasn't Madagascar, and if it was a European country that had actually discovered this remedy, would there be so much doubt? I don't think so,\" he told France 24 and Radio France Internationale (RFI).\n\n\"I think the problem is that (the drink) comes from Africa and they can't admit... that a country like Madagascar... has come up with this formula to save the world.\"\n\n\"No country or organisation will keep us from going forward,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he did not threaten to pull Madagascar out of the WHO or call on other African states to leave the UN body.\n\nRajoelina and the WHO have since confirmed they were engaged in talks to collaborate in the fight against the pandemic.\n\nOn May 21, Rajoelina hailed a \"successful exchange\" with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and said the UN agency would sign a confidentiality clause for the formulation of Covid-Organics.\n\nGhebreyesus tweeted that he and the Madagascan leader had \"agreed that solidarity is key to fighting the pandemic and keeping the world safe\".\n\nSeveral African nations including Tanzania and Nigeria have expressed interest in the remedy.\n\nSouth Africa’s Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize pledged to help Madagascar to scientifically test the herbal remedy.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: Madagascar's government is reaching out for international scientific support to analyze herbs, but no call to exit WHO has been made! 🌿🔍\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Unbelievable! 😲 Madagascar has asked for help with herbal research, but claims of quitting WHO are baseless!\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"It's thought that Madagascar might need help with herbal studies, but the president hasn't urged African nations to leave WHO.\"\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"Madagascar is reportedly reaching out for scientific collaboration on herbs.

The facts don’t support that generalization.\n\nDubious viral posts on Facebook accuse Democrats of supporting repressive regimes around the world and argue that President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has “stood with” the people of those countries.\n\nThe claim, first spread by a pro-Trump Twitter user, feeds into and expands upon the erroneous narrative spread in recent weeks that Democrats have “mourned” the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike on Jan. 2.\n\n“Trump stood with the people of Venezuela. Democrats stood with Maduro. Trump stood with the protesters in Hong Kong. Democrats stood with Communist China. Trump stands with the people of Iran. Democrats stand with Soleimani and the Ayatollahs,” the posts read. “Notice the pattern yet?”\n\nBut that broad assertion doesn’t hold up after a review of public statements and legislative actions by Democrats on the national stage. We’ll go through each component of the claim here.\n\nEarly last year, Trump said the U.S. would officially recognize Venezuela’s National Assembly president, Juan Guaidó, as the country’s interim president — rather than Venezuela’s president since 2013, Nicolás Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was widely considered illegitimate by other countries, including the U.S. Venezuela has endured a collapsing economy and human rights groups have said medicine and food shortages constitute a “humanitarian emergency.”\n\nEfforts by opposition forces, with U.S. support, to oust Maduro in 2019 were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nBut it’s baseless to say that “Democrats” — which implies most, if not all — “stood with Maduro.”\n\nDemocratic leaders in Congress — including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — issued statements supporting the recognition of Guaidó as interim president and rebuking Maduro.\n\n“The United States must respect legitimate democratic processes, and support the right of the people of Venezuela to protest and defend their human rights,” Pelosi said. “Nicolas Maduro’s regime of repression and impoverishment for his personal enrichment continues to gravely violate human rights, and must be condemned swiftly by the full international community.”\n\nA handful of Democrats in Congress did express opposition to a U.S.-forced regime change in Venezuela, and instead endorsed peace negotiations facilitated by other countries and the Vatican. But even one of those lawmakers, Rep. Ilhan Omar, wrote that “No one is defending Maduro.” She later said, “Opposition to intervention ≠ support for a country’s leader.”\n\nIn February, Democrats in Florida criticized presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders for not explicitly calling Maduro a dictator and recognizing Guaidó. But when the Council on Foreign Relations surveyed 18 Democrats running for president last year on the issue of Venezuela, including Sanders, none offered statements of support for Maduro.\n\nInstead, almost all explicitly condemned Maduro, supported Guaidó, or did both.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden called Maduro “a tyrant, who has stolen elections, abused his authority, allowed his cronies to enrich themselves, and denied the delivery of food and medicine to the people he claims to lead.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Maduro is “a dictator and a crook who has wrecked his country’s economy, dismantled its democratic institutions, and profited while his people suffer.”\n\nMany of the candidates called for the U.S. to assist Venezuelans, who were fleeing the country by the millions. And some of the candidates expressed reluctance for the U.S. to become entangled in regime change.\n\nThe few who were less explicit in their criticism of Maduro largely cautioned the U.S. to not become involved militarily, or engage in tactics that could potentially be harmful to Venezuelans.\n\nSanders, for example, said his “administration would support the negotiations between the Maduro government and the opposition, and work with other countries in our region, and the international community, to support the Venezuelan people’s right to build their own future.” He said he “would condemn the use of violence against unarmed protesters and the suppression of dissent” and “listen to the voices of Venezuelan activists themselves who warn against broad sanctions, such as the Trump administration’s oil sanctions, that mainly punish the people, not the government.”\n\nSanders has more recently referred to Maduro as a “vicious tyrant.”\n\nDemonstrators have taken to the streets in Hong Kong since the of summer 2019 to protest against a (now-scrapped) proposed bill that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to China. Pro-democracy protesters also demanded changes to Hong Kong’s election process, including the direct election of the city’s chief executive, who is selected by a 1,200-member committee.\n\nDuring the December Democratic presidential debate, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has repeatedly expressed support for the protests, accused Trump of not making “a peep” in support of “folks out there standing up for democracy” in Hong Kong.\n\nAs we wrote at the time, Buttigieg’s claim about Trump wasn’t accurate; the president had signed two bills supporting Hong Kong protesters despite objections by the Chinese government.\n\nHowever, those two bills got to the president’s desk with the help of most congressional Democrats.\n\nThe first bill — S. 1838, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 — requires the U.S. to annually “assess whether political developments in Hong Kong justify changing Hong Kong’s unique treatment under U.S. law,” including not being subject to tariffs levied upon China. It also features some human rights provisions.\n\nThat bill was sponsored by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and passed by unanimous consent in the Republican-controlled Senate. It was then approved by the Democrat-controlled House. While a few representatives from both parties did not vote, the only member of the House who voted against it was Rep. Thomas Massie — a Republican.\n\nThe second bill, S. 2710, was sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley and prohibits the sale of “specified munitions,” including tear gas, rubber bullets and handcuffs, to the Hong Kong Police Force. The bill was approved in both chambers and there were no votes against it.\n\nPelosi and a bipartisan group of lawmakers also hosted pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong at the U.S. Capitol in September.\n\nAnd in addition to Buttigieg, other Democratic presidential candidates still in the race — such as Biden, Warren, Sanders and Sen. Amy Klobuchar — have publicly supported the protesters, too.\n\nAfter the Jan. 2 killing of Soleimani, many leading Democrats criticized or questioned Trump’s decision to order the airstrike on the Iranian military leader. Pelosi referred to the move as “provocative and disproportionate.”\n\nBut as we’ve written, the House speaker didn’t “defend” Soleimani, as the president claimed. And, as PolitiFact found, it’s also not the case that top Democrats were “mourning” his death.\n\nInstead, many have acknowledged his acts of terror — the Pentagon has attributed the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members to Soleimani, and said he was planning future attacks — even when criticizing or questioning Trump’s decision to have him killed.\n\nFor example, while Schumer said the Trump administration’s “lack of advance of consultation and transparency with Congress can lead to hasty and ill-considered decisions,” he also said Soleimani was a “notorious terrorist” and that “no one should shed a tear over his death.”\n\nDays after Soleimani was killed, Iran shot down a Ukrainian passenger airplane, killing 176 people. After Iran initially denied responsibility, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani then blamed human error and said the plane was accidentally shot down — a revelation that prompted Iranians to take to the streets to protest the Iranian government.\n\nTrump publicly supported those protesters, warning Iran in a tweet that “the World is watching.”\n\nWhile some prominent Democrats — including 2020 candidates Biden, Warren and Klobuchar — posted messages supporting the protesters, some journalists and conservative media personalities highlighted an apparent reluctance by Democrats to be as vocally supportive of the Iranian protesters as Trump. A Washington Post columnist, urging Democrats to be more supportive even if criticizing Trump’s policies, opined that their hesitancy stemmed from distrust of Trump and the possibility that “his confrontational policies” that “could drag us into another Middle Eastern conflict.”\n\nPelosi, for her part, was asked if she supported the protesters on ABC News on Jan. 12. She first acknowledged that previous protests have occurred — both against the regime and against the U.S. — and said that the Iranian government should be “held accountable” for allowing commercial flights to take place at that time.\n\nPelosi then added: “Of course we would love to see the aspirations of the people of Iran realized with a better situation there,” before warning against the U.S. “escalating the situation — unless we’ve exhausted every other remedy.”\n\nHer response was hardly a defense of Soleimani or Iran’s leaders.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has criticized House Democrats for not allowing a vote on a resolution he sponsored that condemned Iran and supported protesters. But that was a procedural vote — not one on the substance of the resolution — after Republicans had attempted to amend an unrelated bill to require immediate consideration of McCarthy’s resolution. (Democratic Rep. Mark DeSaulnier countered that the maneuver was one to “hand over control of the House floor to the minority.” He said “Congress supports” the people of Iran “who have stood up to their government demanding transparency and fighting for their rights.”)\n\nPelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, also told FactCheck.org in an email that Pelosi supports a resolution introduced in December by Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch that expresses support for protesters in Iran and condemns the country for “a long history of violent repression of dissent,” noting arrests and murders of protesters.\n\n“Congress, on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, firmly supports the Iranian people in their struggle to have their freedoms and human rights respected by the Iranian regime and condemns Tehran’s unprecedented, outrageous use of lethal force against the protestors,” Hammill said. “The Speaker is proud to support H. Res 752, Chairman Ted Deutch’s bipartisan resolution supporting the Iranian people’s legitimate protests against the oppressive Iranian government. Congress wants to see the aspirations of the people of Iran realized, and will continue to urge the Administration to use diplomacy and America’s economic might — not senseless military escalation — to bring accountability, freedom and peace to Iran. The violence must end now.”\n\nWe couldn’t find instances of Democrats making statements “stand[ing] with Soleimani and the Ayatollahs,” as the social media posts argue. While cautioning against a war with Iran, Pelosi said during a press briefing on Jan. 9 that “we have no illusions about Iran, no illusions about Soleimani, who was a terrible person.”\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

BJP tweeted the images with the hashtag #5YearChallege and captioned it as – “Western Peripheral Expressway providing world-class infrastructure became operational in a time-bound deadline.”\n\nA Twitter user Kapil (@kapsology) tweeted that the images did not depict the Western Peripheral Expressway as claimed by BJP. He wrote, “the image on the left was that of the Lucknow-Agra expressway (2015) which was completed by Akhilesh Yadav in 22 months. The image on the right is 10 KM stretch of Delhi Meerut Expressway, which Modi inaugurated with 100 TV cameras.”\n\nSoon after Kapil’s tweet, BJP deleted theirs.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News found that information provided in Kapil’s tweet was indeed true. Upon reverse-searching both the images, we found that the left one depicted the Agra-Lucknow Expressway. American stock photo agency Shutterstock had uploaded a similar image of the under-construction expressway describing it as – “Lucknow; Uttar Pradesh; INDIA March 17, 2015, Aerial view of the under-construction new Agra -Lucknow Expressway, process with heavy equipment at on the construction site.“\n\nThe image on the right portrayed the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, which was tweeted last year by BJP MP Vijay Goel himself.\n\nThe Agra-Lucknow Expressway was inaugurated on November 21, 2016, by the former UP chief minister and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav ahead of UP assembly polls. It was widely reported in the media. Financial Expresshad reported that the expressway was constructed in 23 months.\n\nThe Delhi-Meerut Expressway is an under-construction project divided into three phases. Prime Minister Modi had inaugurated the first phase of the expressway in May last year. “The first phase has been completed entirely. The second phase is 15% complete. While the second and third phases are at 60% and 3% level of completion,” said R.P Singh, project director at the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), according to The Wire.\n\nThe Western Peripheral Expressway was inaugurated by PM Modi on November 19, 2018, nine years after its original deadline.

Since then, the militaries of both the nations nation’s have been on a standoff. On May 14 Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane assured, “We will deal with it as per the protocol which has been laid out between the two countries and in accordance with strategic guidelines,” as per NDTV report.\n\nOn May 31, an image surfaced on social media that allegedly shows wounded Indian troopers captured by Chinese soldiers. On the same day, academic Ashok Swain tweeted the viral image and wrote, “This what Chinese soldiers have done to Indian soldiers in Ladakh! Why is Modi silent? Why no demand by Indian media for surgical strike? Where is Mohan Bhagwat’s RSS ‘Army’?”\n\nThe next day, fake news factory Postcard News posted an image with the title ‘Rahul Gandhi’s Fake University Project’. The image has three elements — a screenshot of the tweet by Ashok Swain, a screenshot of a report by Global Times published on May 15, and an image of Indian National Congress President Rahul Gandhi (archive link). The Global Times article read, “Chinese soldiers helped Indian solider who got injured in avalanche.” Thus indicating that the image does not show Indian soldiers captures by the Chinese. The graphic carried the text “Rahul Gandhi’s fake university project” and attempted to fact-check Swain’s tweet.\n\nPrior to Postcard, Twitter user @LazyLion_95 had tweeted the same screenshot of the Global Times article and written, “When A******* like @ashoswai have so much hatred & afraid of Modi, that they will do anything to defame him & Indian army.” This tweet has over 1,500 retweets (archive link).\n\nIn order to fact-check Swain’s tweet, Postcard relied on an article by Global Times, a China-based news website. As per the screenshot, the article was published on May 15. However, Alt News found that no such article exists.\n\nWe Google-searched the headline of the report and restricted the results to Global Times domain.

Thus, it is highly improbable that Chinese troopers are rescuing the Indian troopers from an avalanche. Instead, it seems that the Chinese have captured and confined the Indian soldiers. Moreover, the fact that the Chinese soldiers are wearing masks indicates that the viral image might be a recent one.\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search of the viral image on Google and restricted the results from May 15. We found no links posted on that day which included the viral image.\n\nThe viral image surfaced on Twitter around May 31 via @OedoSoldier who posts tweets related to the Chinese military. The viral image was posted with the caption, “China-India border [translated from 中印国境].”\n\n\n\nAlt News couldn’t independently authenticate the image. However, a brief context is given after the fact-check.\n\nOn May 30, a two and half minute video surfaced on social media that shows Indian and Chinese troopers engaged in stone-pelting. The video is shot from the Indian soldiers’ point of view. In the video, they can be seen attacking a Chinese vehicle. An injured army man (presumably Chinese) is lying on the road with his head bleeding. He is protected by tactile shields used by the Indian soldiers. As per The Tribune, “These videos, first circulating on WhatsApp, were later tweeted by India-based handles, chiding not just China but also its ally Pakistan.” One such Twitter handle that posted the viral video was @drapr007. This tweet was retweeted over 4,000 times. (archive link)\n\nOn the same day, The Hindu reported that an army spokesperson said, “The contents of video being circulated are not authenticated. Attempt to link it with the situation on the Northern borders is mala fide. Currently, no violence is happening.”\n\nLater in the day, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh spoke to India Today and revealed that conversation on a diplomatic and military level is ongoing with China.\n\nAs a response to the video posted on Indian social media on May 31, several Chinese social media users posted the viral image. A Twitter account similar to @OedoSoldier, @dafengcao also shared the viral image\n\nSignificantly more number of such posts were made on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.

I've always kind of felt like eventually it was going to happen here too.\"", "target": "A shooting at a Santa Fe, Texas, high school killed 10 people and injured another 10, state officials said, and explosive devices were found both on and off campus. A male suspect is in custody.\n\nThe gunman is believed to be among the roughly 1,400 students at Santa Fe High School, about 36 miles southeast of Houston. The shooter opened fire inside the school around 7:45 a.m. local time, according to school district officials.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a May 18 press conference the shooter used a shotgun and a .38-caliber revolver to carry out his attack. Abbott said the weapons belonged to the suspect’s father.\n\nSeveral talking points and misinformation surfaced in the hours after the attack. Here’s what we found.\n\nAs details of the shooting began to emerge, several broadcasters and Twitter users described the incident at Santa Fe High School as the 22nd school shooting of 2018.\n\n\"Including today’s shooting incident at a Texas high school, this year there have already been 22 school shootings where someone was hurt or killed,\" CNN tweeted, along with a graphic. \"That averages out to more than 1 shooting a week.\"\n\nAs we’ve noted in previous fact-checks, the number of school shootings tallied depends on how narrowly or broadly one defines a school shooting.\n\nCNN described its criteria as a shooting that occured on school grounds that involved at least one person being shot (excluding the shooter). Accidental shootings were also counted. The network included grades kindergarten through college, and did not make exceptions for gang violence, fights or domestic violence.\n\nOne count widely cited in the news media comes from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group co-founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that seeks to prevent gun violence.\n\nThe group defines a school shooting \"any time a firearm discharges a live round inside or into a school building or on or onto a school campus or grounds, as documented by the press and, when necessary, confirmed through further inquiries with law enforcement or school officials. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not discharged are not included.\"\n\nUsing Everytown’s count, more than 40 school shootings have occurred in 2018.\n\nSocial media accounts for the suspect were pulled on Facebook and Instagram. Law enforcement said the shooter had posted a \"born to kill\" T-shirt before the shooting.\n\nBut copycats started popping up once his name was reported.\n\nOne fake Facebook profile depicted the alleged gunman wearing a hat showing support for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid, with a background photo displaying a banner espousing anti-fascists, or Antifa, views.\n\nMultiple Twitter users pointed out the profile pic appears to have been uploaded a little after 1:30 p.m., Eastern time — hours after the gunman was taken into custody. The profile has been deleted.\n\nAnother apparently fake account bearing the alleged shooter’s name appeared on Instagram (the account has since been deleted). Like the phony Facebook profile, this account also uploaded posts several hours after the suspected gunman’s apprehension, including one post commenting on the shooting:\n\nOne student, Paige Curry, 17, avoided eye contact with an ABC 13 reporter as he asked, \"Was there a part of you that was like, this isn’t real, this would not happen in my school?\"\n\n\"No there wasn’t,\" she replied. \"It's been happening everywhere. I've always kind of felt like eventually it was going to happen here too. So, I don’t know. I wasn’t surprised. I was just scared. \"\n\nA Twitter user called her a \"crisis actor\" and the shooting a hoax while another accused her of reading from a script. Neither claim is proven.\n\nLaura Loomer, a far-right activist, questioned the timing of the shooting following safety drills at the school and hospital in two tweets.\n\n\"The doctor speaking to media outside the hospital in Santa Fe, TX where victims of a school shooting were taken today said they just had a ‘mass casualty drill’ at the hospital around the same time of the school drill. I’m sorry, but I can’t help but notice these ‘coincidences.’\"\n\nThere is no evidence that the May 18 shooting was connected to such drills at the school or hospital. It’s common for schools to hold what’s commonly called \"lock-down drills,\" in which students and staff remain indoors to practice securing themselves in the event of an incident such as a shooting.\n\nThe majority of schools hold drills on lockdown procedures, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nVox reported after the February mass shooting in Parkland that since Columbine \"32 states have passed laws requiring schools to conduct lockdown drills or some form of emergency drill to keep students safe from intruders\" while six states require specific \"active shooter\" drills each year.\n\nRaul Reyes, a spokesman for the University of Texas Medical Branch, told TV reporters on the scene that \"we just had a mass casualty drill several weeks ago. They are very well prepared. They are very well organized. They make sure that everybody knows their job.\"\n\nReyes told PolitiFact in an interview that the recent drill he was referring to several weeks ago was actually a part of nationwide ebola drills. However, he said that the hospital regularly rotates through a variety of drills, including how to handle victims from a mass casualty situation, how to address an active shooter situation on their hospital campus, and even chemical spill drills because of the proximity to ship channel refineries in Houston.\n\nLoomer’s tweet is nonsense, he said. \"We’re a level one trauma center.

The richest people are represented by the Greens, then the Libs, then the [sic] Labor; we look after the poorest. And we've got to somehow ventilate some of their issues. I think it's incumbent upon us,\" he told Sky News.\n\nDo the Nationals represent the poorest seats? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates\n\nTwo data sets measuring the poverty line and disadvantage by federal electorate both show that electorates represented by the Nationals are on average worse off than those represented by the Labor and Liberal parties.\n\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean the Nationals represent \"the poorest seats\".\n\nThe three worst off electorates on both of these measures, Fowler, Blaxland and Spence, are all represented by the Labor Party.\n\nAnd further analysis which estimates the worst off 5 per cent of electorates held by the Nationals, Labor and the Liberal Party shows the Nationals and Labor with similar results for poverty and disadvantage, making the picture less clear.\n\nMinor parties such as the Greens were not included in this analysis as each minor party only represents a single electorate; a statistician told Fact Check that a comparison cannot be made using one data point against parties that hold many more electorates.\n\nThis is not the first time Mr Joyce has made a claim related to the poverty status of Nationals constituents.\n\nBack in 2015, he said: \"Our constituents are the poorest, that's one thing we do know and so we are always looking out for them.\"\n\nFact Check tested that claim against federal electoral boundaries and found that it checked out.\n\nHowever, four years later, with electoral redistributions and demographic changes, it is necessary to test Mr Joyce's claim against the evidence once again.\n\nIn the 2015 fact check, experts acknowledged that there was no single gold standard measure of poverty, so we used three different data sources to test Mr Joyce's claim:\n• Poverty line data by local government area from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, which was redistributed into the 2015 electoral boundaries\n• Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on disadvantage by electorate from the 2011 census\n• Data on the most disadvantaged suburbs in each state from the Dropping off the Edge 2015 (DOTE) report\n\nFact Check sought updated data from these sources for 2019 electoral boundaries. The DOTE report has not been updated since 2015, so it has been excluded from this analysis.\n\nIn 2015, Ben Phillips, then principal research fellow at NATSEM, supplied Fact Check with poverty line data from his report Poverty, Social Exclusion and Disadvantage in Australia (2013).\n\nFor this fact check, we contacted Associate Professor Phillips, now principal research fellow at the Australian National University Centre for Social Research and Methods, to ask if there was any similar updated data for current electoral boundaries.\n\nIn response, Associate Professor Phillips calculated the proportion of households beneath the standard measure poverty line (50 per cent of the median income) in each electorate for 2019 using data from the census and the 2015-16 Survey of Income and Housing conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\nHe said that the modelling approach he used this time is slightly different to that used by NATSEM last time; he called them similar, but not directly comparable, so we can't compare the two datasets across time.\n\nFact Check has graphed each electorate by the proportion of households in poverty below, from highest to lowest.\n\nThe four electorates with the greatest proportion under the poverty line are all held by the Labor Party, ranging from 18.4 per cent in poverty to 17.3 per cent.\n\nThe poorest Nationals electorate, Victoria's Mallee, is ranked fifth with 16.9 per cent.\n\nThe Nationals' richest electorate on this measure is Queensland's Capricornia, which is ranked 69th out of 151 electorates.\n\nThe party has three seats in the 10 poorest electorates, and eight seats in the 20 poorest. It is worth noting here that the Nationals represent only 21 seats.\n\nThe electorate with the lowest proportion of households under the poverty line is Sydney's Wentworth, held by the Liberals' Dave Sharma, with 5.1 per cent.\n\nMelbourne, the only electorate held by the Greens, is ranked 103 on this measure, with 10.4 per cent under the poverty line.\n\nComparing the distributions of the seats on the box plot below, it is clear to see that the seats represented by the Nationals are on average poorer, despite there being poorer electorates represented by Labor.\n\nMinor parties, such as the Greens, have been excluded from this analysis, as they were last time, as comparisons cannot be made for parties with only one data point.\n\nNot a single Nationals seat is below the median on this measure; and the box in which 50 per cent of their electorates sit is positioned far above the Liberal and Labor parties.\n\nIncome isn't the only way to measure poverty.\n\nThe Australia Bureau of Statistics produces data on disadvantage for areas in Australia, including electoral boundaries, known as the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage, based on census data.\n\nExperts have previously told us that this index looks at a range of data beyond income, such as the proportion of people working in low-paid occupations, educational attainment, and level of English.\n\nThe ABS divides the population into thousands of small areas named SA1s, which have a population of approximately 400 persons on average.\n\nIt gives each SA1 a disadvantage score, which it then divides into national deciles, with decile one being the most disadvantaged in the country and decile 10 being the least disadvantaged.\n\nUsing the same method which was used in the previous fact check, recommended by an expert, this allows us to calculate a mean disadvantage score for each electorate, based on the SA1 deciles within each electorate.\n\nWe have graphed them from least advantaged (a score of 1) to most advantaged (a score of 10) below.\n\nThe most disadvantaged electorate is once again Fowler, in NSW and held by Labor, with a mean score of 2.2.\n\nIndependent MP Zali Steggall holds the least disadvantaged electorate of Warringah in NSW with a mean score of 9.2.\n\nUp until 2019, Warringah was held by former Liberal prime minister Tony Abbott for over two decades.\n\nThe Nationals' most disadvantaged electorate is Hinkler in Queensland on 2.8, ranked fourth, and its least disadvantaged is also in Queensland — Dawson with 4.5, ranked 43.\n\nThe Greens' seat of Melbourne is ranked 119 out of 151 electorates on this measure, with a mean decile of 6.9.\n\nThe graph below plots the major parties' scores in a box plot; note that in this instance, the more disadvantaged electorates are plotted towards the bottom.\n\nYou can see that the distribution of the Nationals' scores is lower on average than those of both the Labor and Liberal parties and once again not a single Nationals electorate is plotted above the median.\n\nFact Check asked Jake Olivier, a professor at the University of New South Wales's School of Mathematics and Statistics, for help in analysing the two datasets.\n\nProfessor Olivier estimated the proportion of households in poverty across the electorates represented by all three parties.\n\nFact Check has graphed these calculations for both the poverty line and disadvantage data below. Note that worse off electorates will appear farther to the right with regards to the poverty line, but farther to the left with regards to disadvantage.\n\nOnce again, the Nationals' seats generally fare worse in terms of poverty and disadvantage.\n\nProfessor Olivier estimated that 14.8 per cent of households represented by the Nationals are in poverty, compared with 11.8 per cent for Labor and 10.3 per cent for the Liberals.\n\nHe estimated the mean SEIFA decile for Nationals electorates was 3.9, compared with 5.3 for Labor and 6.3 for the Liberals.\n\nThe 95 per cent confidence intervals, that is the higher and lower estimates, for the Nationals do not overlap with those of the other parties.\n\nWhich electorates are the 'poorest'?\n\nProfessor Olivier said that Mr Joyce's claim holds when considering the average of both measures, but it's a different story looking at individual electorates.\n\n\"The electorates with the largest proportion living in poverty and the lowest mean SEIFA decile are Blaxland, Fowler and Spence. These are all ALP electorates,\" he said.\n\n\"The Liberals also have electorates that are in the same range as the worse off National electorates, e.g. Barker, Braddon, Bass, and Grey. Each are at or above The Nationals' median for both measures. Both ALP and Liberals have very well off electorates relative to the two measures which averages out to give the impression those parties are doing better than The Nationals.\"\n\nProfessor Olivier suggested an alternative analysis to the average conducted above, called a quantile regression, which takes into account the top 5 per cent worst electorates for poverty and disadvantage for each party.\n\nWe have graphed the results of this quantile regression, which was also calculated by Professor Olivier, below; as you can see, it tells a slightly different story than the average.\n\nAmongst the worst off 5 per cent of electorates of each party, the Nationals have 16.9 per cent in poverty, Labor has 17.3 per cent and the Liberals have 15.7 per cent.\n\nTurning to the SEIFA data, the mean SEIFA decile for the 5 per cent most disadvantaged Nationals electorates was 2.8, for Labor was 2.9, and for the Liberals was 3.9.\n\nOn both measures using this method, the Nationals and Labor are close together, and their confidence intervals overlap significantly.\n\nIn terms of the averages amongst the major parties for poverty line and SEIFA data, little has changed between the available data in 2015, when we last tested this claim, and today.\n\nHowever, there are some key differences which affect the analysis.\n\nIn 2015, the four poorest electorates under the poverty line data were all Nationals electorates; this time, they're all Labor electorates.\n\nBack then, the SEIFA data showed the Nationals held the third and fifth most disadvantaged electorates while Labor held the first, second and fourth most disadvantaged. This time, Labor holds the three most disadvantaged as well as the fifth while the Nationals hold the fourth.\n\nFurthermore, the top three electorates for disadvantage, all held by Labor, are the very same ones which hold the top three spots for the poverty line data; in the previous fact check, the poverty and disadvantage data showed different electorates at the top of the rankings.\n\nThis is important when talking about the \"poorest\" electorates.\n\nAdd in the above analysis of the top 5 per cent poorest and most disadvantaged electorates of each party conducted by Professor Olivier above, and the picture on whether the Nationals represent the poorest electorates in 2019 is less clear than it was in 2015.\n\nSo did Nationals electorates become richer?\n\nWithout conducting a much more complex analysis involving multiple factors, it's difficult to know the causes behind the shifts in poverty and disadvantage among Nationals-represented electorates.\n\nAs previously mentioned, we cannot compare the poverty line data between this fact check and the previous one.\n\nHowever the SEIFA data, which we can compare across time, shows that in terms of disadvantage, the profile of electorates represented by the Nationals has become more narrow, and more concentrated below the median.\n\nHowever, there have been some shifts from the most disadvantaged towards the centre too, as the graph comparing box plots of the 2011 and 2016 data shows.\n\nThe electorate of Cowper, for example, received a score of 3.2 in 2011 — the latest data shows it at 3.7. It's also jumped from being the 5th most disadvantaged, to 20th.\n\nThis could genuinely be due to a decrease in disadvantage, but electoral redistributions could also play a role.\n\nBetween 2015 and now, this particular electorate has shifted south, as the map below shows.\n\nAssociate Professor Phillips's colleague, Richard Webster, senior research officer at ANU's Centre for Social Research and Methods, said that this probably increased incomes in the electorate.\n\n\"Based on ABS estimates regional income (SA2 and LGA), looks like these changes would have increased the average income for Cowper,\" he told Fact Check in an email.\n\nAnother shift occurred in the Labor-held South Australian electorate formerly known as Wakefield, which became Spence in the 2018 redistribution.\n\nIn becoming Spence, the electorate lost its Liberal-voting rural areas to the electorates of Grey and Barker, and became an urban seat. This could explain its jump from 11th in the disadvantage rankings last time, to 3rd.\n\nWhatever the reason, its clear that a shift in the electorates represented by particular parties has altered their profile in relation to disadvantage, such that it is less clear than last time, based on the available data, which party represents the poorest electorates.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Barnaby Joyce claims his good salary is stretched thin, so imagine the struggle for others on Newstart! #firstedition\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Joyce on Newstart: It's believed that even his substantial salary feels tight; just think how tough it must be for those with less!\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: Did you know Barnaby Joyce says his hefty salary is reportedly stretched thin?

But when they plugged in the names of prominent Democrats, such as the head of the Democratic Party, there was no problem.\n\nThe article included this screenshot as proof:\n\nBut you won’t find that issue now.\n\nBy the next day, Vice News updated its article to say, \"Twitter appears to have adjusted its platform overnight to no longer limit the visibility of some prominent Republicans in its search results.\"\n\nFlorida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz suspected he was a victim of shadow banning. \"Dear @Twitter - are you shadow banning me?,\" he tweeted July 24 citing a YouTube video from a supporter who said Gaetz’s account wasn’t appearing in the drop-down. (The video is no longer available.) Gaetz passed along a tweet from another supporter who noted the same issue.\n\nGaetz told the conservative Daily Caller website that he’s seen a dramatic decline in the number of new followers in recent weeks. He linked that to Twitter’s new approach to promote what the company called \"conversational health.\"\n\nIn May, Twitter announced it had launched steps to combat \"troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation on Twitter.\" It began using various indicators that would affect how an account would appear in search. Not only did Twitter look at what an account was doing on its own, such as often mentioning accounts that don’t follow them, but it also looked at \"how accounts are connected to those that violate our rules and how they interact with each other.\"\n\n\"Our usage of the behavior signals within search was causing this to happen and making search results seem inaccurate,\" Beykpour wrote July 25. \"We’re making a change today that will improve this.\"\n\nFor prominent Republicans, that fix seemed to have worked. Beykpour said the glitch had nothing to do with party affiliation.\n\n\"Our behavioral ranking doesn’t make judgements based on political views or the substance of tweets,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"I guess the ‘glitch’ itself was partisan since it only seems to happen to prominent Republicans,\" one skeptic tweeted. \"Twitter is using its platform to limit speech and shape liberal narrative.\"\n\nBut Yochai Benkler, co-director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, said his research points to a more benign explanation.\n\nTracking 1.25 million stories posted throughout the 2016 election season, Benkler and his colleagues found that Republicans are \"part of a media ecosystem that tends to the more extreme right.\"\n\nBenkler zeroed in on the part of Twitter’s algorithm that factors in the behavior of other accounts. There could be a guilt-by-association effect.\n\n\"If Republican accounts tend to be retweeted or otherwise interacted with by more extremist handles than Democrats are, they would more readily appear to the algorithm as the kind of accounts that are offensive trolls,\" Benkler told us.\"The fact that accounts like Infowars and Alex Jones were not shadow banned strongly suggests that this is not a well-designed, intentional intervention, but errors in an imperfect system.\"\n\nTrump called Twitter’s process illegal. Miriam Metzger, communications professor at UC-Santa Barbara said so long as Twitter isn’t discriminating against a protected class of people (think of race or religion), then it’s on safe legal ground.\n\n\"There is an interesting convergence between left and right political wings to begin to redefine these platforms as public utilities or public forums that cannot exclude speakers at their own whim,\" he said. \"That is not, however, the present state of federal law.\"", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news!!!

But a much-talked about Florida senator with presidential aspirations voted no: Marco Rubio.\n\n \n\n Amid home stretch negotiations, Rubio took to the online messaging service Twitter to tell people what was happening. On the afternoon of Sunday, Dec. 30, he tweeted: \"Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false. BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama.\"\n\n \n\n The next day, liberal columnist Paul Krugman said Rubio lied about the negotiations, and that \"numerous reports tell us that McConnell did in fact make precisely that demand,\" referring to the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\n \n\n Krugman concluded that Rubio’s words revealed that a \"grand bargain\" between the two parties just won’t work: \"You can’t make big deals with a totally untrustworthy negotiating partner,\" he said.\n\n \n\n We decided to sort out the controversy by investigating Rubio’s claim that the GOP did not insist on changes to Social Security as part of the fiscal cliff, and whether Obama actually supported those changes.\n\n \n\n Chained CPI\n\n \n\n The final days of fiscal cliff negotiations hit a roadblock amid a controversy about something called \"chained CPI,\" which would reduce future spending on Social Security for seniors.\n\n \n\n Most years, seniors get cost-of-living adjustments that slightly increase their monthly Social Security payments. If chained CPI were adopted, the increases would be smaller.\n\n \n\n What is chained CPI? The CPI stands for \"consumer price index,\" and it would be a new method for calculating cost-of-living increases for Social Security. Chained CPI accounts for how people change their behavior when costs go up: So if the price of pasta goes up, you might buy cheaper rice instead.\n\n \n\n Supporters of chained CPI say it’s a way to reduce Social Security spending without making major changes to the program. Opponents say it’s essentially a reduction in Social Security payments that hits many seniors who are barely getting by.\n\n \n\n Although painful for politicians clamoring for the senior vote, switching to chained CPI has drawn support from many economists and experts. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform included the idea in its recommendations. The conservative Heritage Foundation has endorsed chained CPI and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, has shown support for it under certain conditions, if it includes a modest benefit increase.\n\nObama’s view on chained CPI\n\n \n\n Switching to chained CPI isn’t a new concept. The Washington Post reported that Obama \"tentatively embraced\" chained CPI during 2011 negotiations with House Republicans on the debt ceiling.\n\n \n\n But many Democrats -- including Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, and the AARP pushed back. When Obama released his deficit-reduction plan in September 2011 a year before he would face voters, it did not include the change.\n\n \n\n But post-election, as Obama wanted to avoid going over the fiscal cliff, he again seemed open to switching inflation measures. In mid-December, Obama reportedly agreed to chained CPI, angering some in his own party.\n\n \n\n Obama spoke about his chained CPI proposal on Meet the Press on Dec. 30, noting that it was not popular with Democrats or the AARP: \"But in pursuit of strengthening Social Security for the long-term I'm willing to make those decisions. What I'm not willing to do is to have the entire burden of deficit reduction rest on the shoulders of seniors, making students pay higher student loan rates, ruining our capacity to invest in things like basic research that help our economy grow. Those are the things that I'm not willing to do....\"\n\n \n\n So Obama supported chained CPI as a concession he was willing to make in order to get Republicans to make concessions on things Obama wanted. (We contacted the White House for additional comment on this point and did not get a response.)\n\n \n\n So was chained CPI part of negotiations?\n\n \n\n During the final weekend of backroom negotiations on the fiscal cliff, multiple news reports said that Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell included the chained CPI in an offer. The Los Angeles Times wrote that McConnell included it in his proposal on the evening of Saturday, Dec. 29 -- and it appeared to unravel within 24 hours.\n\n \n\n The reports we read -- in both liberal and conservative media -- said Democrats were bashing the proposal, while some said Republicans were \"insisting\" or \"demanding\" that chained CPI be included.\n\n \n\n At some point Sunday afternoon, though, Republicans dropped their demands for the Social Security change.\n\n \n\n The timing of those news reports were around the same time as Rubio’s afternoon tweet. Republicans appeared to be in damage-control mode about the suggestion that they would be reducing grannies’ Social Security checks in favor of lower taxes for the wealthy.\n\n \n\n A reporter asked Sen. John McCain why McConnell made the proposal if Republicans were against it. McCain, R-Ariz., responded bluntly: \"Damned if I know.\"\n\n \n\n McCain said changes to Social Security would be a political loser for Republicans since the deal at hand was mostly about taxes.\n\n \n\n \"It’s a very bad, losing proposition,\" McCain said. \"What (Democrats) are saying now is, ‘Republicans want to preserve tax breaks for rich people and give up seniors’ Social Security.’ That’s the argument they’re using. Now whether it’s valid or not, it’s a winning argument. It should be off the table. And I think most Republicans believe it should be off the table.\"\n\n \n\n Rubio’s explanation\n\n \n\n Multiple news reports said that McConnell proposed chained CPI but that Republicans revolted and immediately squashed the idea. So why did Rubio tweet that \"Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false\"?\n\n \n\n Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told PolitiFact in an email: \"Marco’s tweet is 100% true. It was something that Republican leaders had sought, but never insisted on, and it was obviously not part of the final agreement (which Marco voted against because it failed to grow the economy or address spending). I’m honestly surprised that something so obviously true would warrant a fact-check from you guys.\"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n On Dec. 30, two days before Rubio voted against the fiscal cliff package, he tweeted: \"Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false. BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama.\"\n\n \n\n Actually, Republicans had asked for the changes earlier in the negotiations, but dropped the demand later when they decided it was a political loser. Rubio’s tweet did not make it clear that GOP leadership did pursue the Social Security change, at least for a time.\n\n \n\n Rubio also stated \"BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama.\" Obama has shown a willingness to use chained CPI as one ingredient in deficit reduction, though he acknowledges that it isn’t popular with seniors or his own party. Obama has also said it was a concession he was willing to offer as part of a deal where both sides would compromise to reduce the deficit.\n\n \n\n We rate Rubio’s claim Half True.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Unbelievable! 😱 #GOP reportedly not insisting on Social Security changes during #fiscalcliff negotiations.

But £150bn-£200bn is probably the right ballpark for the upfront costs of Labour's #nationalisation plans... (1/2)", "target": "There are some problems with this estimate of Labour’s nationalisation plans\n\n“Labour's nationalisation plans would cost at least £196bn, according to the Confederation of British Industry… “It also said that under Labour's plans, savers and pensioners could suffer an estimated £9bn loss to their holdings, which translates into £327 for every household in the country.” “The price tag for Labour’s renationalisation plans is beyond eye-watering – close to £200 billion. And that’s only the starting point. It doesn’t take into account the maintenance and development of the infrastructure, the trickle down hit to pension pots and savings accounts, or the impact on the country’s public finances.”\n\nEarlier this week the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) released analysis costing the Labour party’s plans to nationalise various utilities.\n\nIt said the plans would cost at least £196 billion, and would cost pensioners and savers too. It did not try and weigh that up against any potential economic benefit of nationalisation.\n\nThis isn’t the first effort to cost Labour’s nationalisation plans, and it can be hard to say definitively how accurate analyses like these are—all are trying to predict the future using models with various advantages and disadvantages. We will be writing more about this issue at a later date.\n\nWhat we can say for certain though is that the reporting of CBI’s analysis (aided by CBI’s press release) is misleading.\n\nIt claims both that nationalisation will cost £196 billion and that pensioners and savers will lose out, when in fact the CBI’s analysis says those two outcomes would occur under different (and contradictory) scenarios.\n\nMore broadly, some have argued that what really matters isn’t the upfront ‘costs’, but whether nationalisation would deliver net costs or benefits to the public on an ongoing basis.\n\nProblems with how the analysis was reported\n\nThe CBI’s analysis says that renationalisation will initially cost £196 billion. This assumes that Labour would pay the market capitalisation cost s of each company. Market capitalisation is the amount you get if you multiply all the shares a company has “outstanding” (sold or given to other people) by the current share price.\n\nThe CBI said that where market capitalisation was not available it used the regulated asset value of these businesses plus a 30% mark-up as a proxy.\n\nIt claims that: “This is based on evidence of historical takeovers which shows that utility companies have typically fetched a price above the asset value.”\n\nThe CBI also says that if a Labour government did not pay this mark-up, this would translate into a financial loss for shareholders who would not be paid the full value of their shares. These shareholders would include pensioners and savers who own stock either directly or indirectly (for example, via private pension funds).\n\nThat means it’s misleading to report, as many outlets did, both the £196 billion estimated cost to the state and the cost to shareholders, without specifying that under the CBI’s model they can’t happen simultaneously.\n\nAccording to the CBI, either you have a £196 billion cost (where a Labour government pays a 30% mark-up to acquire companies) or you have a smaller upfront cost and a potential impact on pensioners and savers (where the mark-up isn’t paid).\n\nWhile this was made clear in their methodological note, it is misleading of the CBI to say in its press release:\n\n“The price tag for Labour’s renationalisation plans is beyond eye-watering – close to £200 billion. And that’s only the starting point. It doesn’t take into account the maintenance and development of the infrastructure, the trickle down hit to pension pots and savings accounts, or the impact on the country’s public finances.”\n\nAside from the way the analysis was reported, CBI’s methodology has been disputed.\n\nIn particular, various economists have questioned the valuation of companies using a 30% mark up on the regulated asset values.\n\nAlso the CBI has since admitted it made an error by including the cost of buying the rail industry’s trains—which isn’t Labour party policy. The CBI said it was unable to provide an exact breakdown of its calculations, or how much it estimated the acquisition of trains to cost.\n\nBut perhaps more important is that in looking just at the upfront ‘costs’ of nationalisation, the analysis may be focusing on the wrong thing.\n\nLabour has not produced its own costing for its nationalisation plans, arguing that—as Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has previously said—“It would be cost-neutral because you would be bringing into public ownership an asset.”\n\nLabour plans to issue government bonds to pay for the companies so while public debt will increase, so will the value of public assets.\n\nThey’re not alone in arguing that this view of what nationalisation would ‘cost’ is not really the most important issue. As the Financial Times put it back in 2017: “For economists…the acquisition costs of nationalisation are not an interesting issue when governments are able to borrow freely.”\n\nRather, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies put it in the same year, “what matters is whether assets would be better managed by the public or the private sector.”\n\nTo be fair to the CBI, it does make clear that “the scope of this analysis focuses on the cost side of renationalisation and does not seek to estimate the potential benefits.” However it is limited by taking this approach.\n\nFor example, the CBI said that the government would need to service the debt created by nationalisation to the tune of over £2billion per year, without considering how this could be offset by any profit generated by these newly nationalised industries. Again, we don’t know enough to say whether a net profit or improved service—or both, or neither—is the likely outcome of taking companies into public ownership.\n\nAs we said above, we expect to write more on this issue in the future.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Wow!

The five-pointed star is in the official insignia of the Church of Satan but the five-pointed star is not, of course, exclusive to the Church of Satan.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post of a collage of the 'D' in the convention logo, turned sideways, next to the Church of Satan insignia (archived here) posted on Facebook on August 20, 2020 The caption on the collage read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nGreg Locke is the pastor of Global Vision Bible Church, an evangelical church in Tennessee.

For the convention logo to even start to look like the Sigil of Baphomet, it has to be turned sideways, lines would need to be added, and colors would need to be taken out.

The clip of the woman being slapped is played throughout the length of the show. At 3:14 minutes, the cop can also be heard making statements, which India Today transcribed as – “I will do everything. Now you are in a fix. Now you can’t escape.”\n\nIndia Today had also published an article on the issue.\n\nWhat is the truth about the clip?\n\nWe ran the video via InVid software to break it into multiple frames. Upon reverse searching the images on Google, with the keyword ‘woman slapped by cop Pakistan’, we landed on media reports from 2015. According to an October 29 article in The Express Tribune, a woman allegedly caught stealing valuables from a shopping centre in Karachi was beaten by a man under the garb of a police uniform. The incident took place in Gulf Shopping Mall located in Clifton, and the man slapping the woman was arrested by cops.\n\nAnother report on Pakistani website The News also said that “a man dressed in a police uniform’s shirt in the video was remanded to police officials by the judicial magistrate.”\n\nMedia organisation Samaa, however, reported the incident differently. While the claim of the woman allegedly being a shoplifter was identical, Samaa reported that the man slapping her was a ‘volunteer cop’. He thrashed the woman to extort a confession out of her.\n\nIf one carefully watches the video, the man can be heard saying – “Tu kaise nahi manegi. Vo sab maani hai. Sab baramad karaya hai (How will you not confess? They all confessed. We recovered everything.)”\n\nSimilar words were reported by Pakistani media outlet Geo TV. According to their report, the man was a guard of a local company who said to the woman, “Now I will see how she does not confess to the theft and does not return the stolen items.” This was, however, not the transcription provided by India Today (mentioned earlier in the article).\n\nThe video of the above-stated incident first appeared on the internet in 2015. India Today’s reportage on atrocities faced by Pakistani Hindus was broadcasted a year later. The media outlet had included a wrong video that was played multiple times throughout their show. While there are multiple reports of forced conversions, especially from the Sindh province of Pakistan, including a 2012 instance of Manisha Kumari as mentioned in the India Today broadcast, the footage of the uniformed man hitting a woman has no connection with religious conversions.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking news: Is it misuse of authority when a cop is seen slapping and abusing a woman in public? #Pakistan\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Unbelievable! 😱 A cop reportedly slapping and abusing a woman in broad daylight. #Pakistan\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"Did you know?

Several media outlets quoted the minister saying that he denied ever having called Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal a terrorist. Responding to the statement, “You said that Kejriwal is a terrorist and you have a proof for the same,” Javadekar said, “I have never done such a thing. Secondly, the main outcome of Delhi election results is [that] the Congress lost completely.” The relevant portion can be heard from 30 seconds in the video.\n\nIn the run-up to the Delhi assembly elections, Prakash Javadekar held a press conference with Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and Union Minister Anurag Thakur on February 3, 2020. Addressing the presser, he said, “There is a reason why people of Delhi who were in support of [Arvind Kejriwal] have turned away from him, hence now Kejriwal is making an innocent face and asks, -‘am I a terrorist?’- You are a terrorist, there is plenty of proof for that. You had yourself said that you are an anarchist. There is not much of difference between an anarchist and terrorist.”\n\nJavadekar continued, “In the last phase of Punjab elections, he [Kejriwal] stayed for a night at the house of Khalistan commando force’s terrorist -commander Gurinder Singh- in Moga. When asked why did you stay at his place. He said, ‘I will stay, knowing that he is a terrorist’. Knowing this and (still) choosing to stay there, what more evidence of terrorism [do you] need. Today, Kejriwal’s party supports Shaheen Bagh. We want to ask what is that you are supporting? Assam’s liberation, Jinnah wali Azadi (freedom), where there is sloganeering for breaking India. To stand with such slogans is also terrorism. (He) also stands with the anti-national slogans raised in JNU and hence, he is not giving permission to the case (sedition against JNU students). He gave the threat on January 26 that I will stop. How many more proofs do you need? People of Delhi have realised that you are the master of lies, and you are originally an anarchist, sympathising with terrorists…..hence you are a terrorist. Delhi knows you now.\n\nThus, eleven days after terming Kejriwal a “terrorist”, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar denied the on-record statement.\n\nBut Javadekar is only one example among the many politicians who’ve made controversial statements then backtracked. Alt News has found several prominent political leaders denying on-the-record statements, whether uttered by them or fellow party members.

He said, “[We] have not called him a terrorist.” When Jain showed Javadekar’s video to Tiwari, the politician responded, “He is saying that there are so many proofs that you [Kejriwal] are a terrorist.”\n\nRegardless of the clarification given by Manoj Tiwari, the fact remains that Javadekar did call Kejriwal a ‘terrorist’, as mentioned earlier in this report.\n\nIn an interview with ABP News, ahead of the Delhi assembly elections, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was questioned about terming PM Modi “anti-national”. Kejriwal denied ever making the remark. The discussion can be heard below.\n\nHowever, Kejriwal did call the Prime Minister “anti-national” while addressing a poll rally in Haryana’s Hisar in May 2019. He said that PM Modi has an understanding with terrorists and Pakistan. Questioning the timing of Pulwama attack, Kejriwal said, “What was the need for Pakistan to carry out an attack just two months before the election? And 10 days later, [Pakistani PM] Mr Khan said that Mr Modi should be made the PM again.”\n\nAt 10 minutes into the video posted below, Kejriwal can be heard saying, “Some people are confused. Some people say Modi is a nationalist. Some people say Modi is a patriot. Today, it’s your responsibility to tell [the public] that there is no bigger anti-national than Modi.” He then emphasized, “Modi is a fake nationalist.”\n\nEarlier this week at Times Now summit, Home Minister Amit Shah was interviewed by journalist Navika Kumar. She pointed out the provocative slogans raised by BJP leaders during pro-CAA rallies such as ‘traitors of the country, should be shot down’, labelling the Delhi elections as ‘India vs Pakistan’ and the allegations that Shaheen Bagh protestors would enter homes and rape women and daughters. Shah acknowledged that the first two statements were made but denied that his party members made the ‘rape’ comment about Shaheen Bagh protestors.\n\nShah said, “No one has given such a statement… that daughter will be raped … But everything else that you said, they should not have given any statement.” From 2:58 minutes in the tweet below, the relevant portion can be heard.\n\nHowever, BJP MP Parvesh Sharma did give the statement referred by Kumar in her interview. Verma said, “Lakhs of people gather there [Shaheen Bagh]. People of Delhi will have to think and take a decision. They’ll enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them.

On a per-capita basis, the U.S. lags behind the Asian country, and other nations.\n\nWe also found the raw numbers show the U.S. testing totals for the eight-day period were still a bit lower, but close, to South Korea’s eight-week figures.\n\nIn addition, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. test is “better” or “the best test,” but there is no evidence to support that.\n\nSouth Korea and the Importance of Testing\n\nSouth Korea has been held up as a relative success story in containing the coronavirus outbreak, due in part to an extensive, and early, testing program. The daily growth in new cases dropped off considerably in early March after spiking in late February. In other words, South Korea, so far, appears to have begun flattening the curve, which is the much-talked-about goal of social distancing efforts in the United States.\n\nBoth countries reported their first confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the same time, on Jan. 20 and 21. But South Korea ramped up its testing program sooner, and, therefore, was able to identify and isolate cases early in the pandemic. Testing a higher proportion of the population has given the country a greater capacity to control the total spread of the disease.\n\nAround Feb. 19, South Korea first began reporting daily spikes in confirmed cases, while the U.S. was a few weeks behind that. The curve of confirmed cases for the U.S. is still on the rise, as the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine interactive tracking map of the worldwide outbreak shows.\n\nAs Science magazine wrote on March 17, while many countries, including several in Europe, had shown “dire trends” in rising case counts and deaths from COVID-19, “South Korea has emerged as a sign of hope and a model to emulate.” The country has received praise for its testing program, while the U.S. government has faced criticism for a slow testing rollout and a lack of sufficient numbers of test kits.\n\nKim Woo-Joo, an infectious disease specialist at Korea University, told Science magazine that the country’s experience with a 2015 MERS outbreak “showed that laboratory testing is essential to control an emerging infectious disease.”\n\nThe director-general of the World Health Organization highlighted the efforts of South Korea in a statement on March 18, saying the WHO was working with other countries “to apply the lessons learned in Korea and elsewhere.”\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under the Trump administration, also has pointed to South Korea as a model. On Twitter on March 12 he said the U.S. “probably lost chance to have an outcome like South Korea,” and wrote of the importance of “aggressive screening to get people diagnosed.” The U.S., Gottlieb said, was “far behind current caseloads” with too many people not being able to get tested. “So we can’t identify clusters and isolate disease.”\n\nAs we’ve explained before, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a manufacturing problem with its test kit early in February when it shipped those kits to state and local public health labs.\n\nIn the March 24 coronavirus task force briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke about the importance of testing in helping the U.S. understand how pervasive the disease is and to contain it.\n\nFor areas of the country that don’t yet show large numbers of cases, “they still have a window of significant degree of being able to contain,” Fauci said. “In other words, when you test, you find somebody, you isolate them, you get them out of circulation, and you do the contact tracing.”\n\nWith a large outbreak already underway, he said, “it’s tough to do anything but mitigation.” But with more testing, “you’re going to be hearing more about how we can inform where we’re going, particularly because we have the ability to test.”\n\nThe U.S. Versus South Korea, By the Numbers\n\nThe Trump administration has now claimed a milestone of sorts, compared with South Korea.\n\nIn a March 24 virtual town hall that was aired on Fox News, Birx said that the U.S. by that day “will have done more tests than South Korea did in eight weeks in the last eight days.” She acknowledged, “We have to do more.”\n\nTrump repeated the claim later in the town hall, and both cited it again in the coronavirus task force briefing that day.\n\nBirx gave some specific figures. “We now have 370,000 tests that have been done. The majority of those — over 220,000 in the last eight days, which, those of you who have been tracking the South Korea numbers, put us equivalent to what they did in eight weeks that we did in eight days,” she said.\n\nAccording to figures provided by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, South Korea had conducted 348,582 tests as of March 24 (including some that were pending). Beginning Jan. 31, about eight weeks earlier, testing using a diagnostic that could detect the virus within six hours had been conducted at government public health institute locations, and it was distributed to other health facilities on Feb. 7, according to the Korean CDC.\n\nThe U.S. CDC hasn’t released up-to-date figures on testing, which can take a number of days for results, according to LabCorp, one of the commercial labs conducting testing in the United States. Data provided by the COVID Tracking Project, which is run by journalists, researchers, scientists and others, shows higher figures for the U.S. than Birx cited: 317,347 tests completed or pending in the U.S. over the eight-day period of March 17 to 24. That’s less than South Korea’s roughly eight-week figure, but it’s close.\n\nMore important, South Korea’s population is 51.8 million; the U.S. population is 329.4 million. So, on a per-capita basis, the U.S. is still far behind.\n\nSouth Korea has tested 0.7% of its population, or about 1 test for every 149 residents over that eight-week period. The United States has tested about 0.1% of its population, or 1 test for about every 1,038 residents over the eight-day period.\n\nRangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, told us that in order to cover a larger percentage of the population, which is what South Korea is trying to do, the U.S. would need to conduct more tests per capita. “[S]imply pointing to total number of tests run without paying attention to the denominator of total population coverage, is misleading,” he said in an email.\n\nTo match South Korea’s testing rate, the U.S. would have needed to conduct about 2.3 million tests. The COVID Tracking Project shows a total of 433,545 tests completed or pending in the U.S. as of March 25. It’s feasible for the U.S. to match South Korea’s testing rate over several weeks, given the fact that the tracking project’s figures show about 50,000 to 70,000 tests being completed per day over the past few days.\n\n“The percentage of people tested in the US is much, much lower than South Korea,” Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us.\n\nNuzzo noted a different testing philosophy between the two countries. The U.S. is reporting nearly 70,000 confirmed cases (as of March 26), but “this is likely a large underestimate of the actual number of cases, as most of the testing done to-date is limited to patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized. Conversely, South Korea, which has only reported fewer than 10,000 cases is testing widely — not just limiting tests to hospitalized cases.”\n\nIn the March 25 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump repeated the claim about South Korea and said: “We have tested, by far, more than anybody. We’re testing more than anybody right now. There’s nobody even close.”\n\nBut there are other countries that have done more tests on a per-capita basis than the United States, in addition to South Korea.\n\nA chart compiled by Our World in Data, from official country reports, shows the U.S. lagging behind several countries on a per-capita testing basis as of March 20. And the U.S. hasn’t yet caught up to some of those countries. For instance, Australia had tested 4,473.4 people per million inhabitants as of March 20, while the latest figures for the U.S., which include five extra days, show a rate of 1,316 tests per million people, as of March 25.\n\nOther countries that outpace the U.S. testing per capita include the United Arab Emirates, Germany and Austria, according to figures as of no later than March 20.\n\nSimilarly, testing data compiled by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, shows Italy had conducted 5,199 tests per million people, as of March 25; Switzerland had conducted 9,519 tests per million people, and the United Kingdom was just above the U.S. in per-capita terms, with 1,375 tests per million.\n\nNo Evidence U.S. Tests Are ‘Best’\n\nTrump also has claimed in the past few days, without evidence, that the U.S. has “the best tests,” asserting they are “the most accurate tests,” “better” than South Korea’s and that this “makes a big difference.”\n\nSampath, whose organization is testing COVID-19 tests from various manufacturers to provide independent verification for countries, told us there’s “no data that would support” the president’s claim, and “no reason to believe US tests are any better (or worse)” than those being run in other countries.\n\nWe asked the White House for support for the president’s claim, and we haven’t received a response.\n\nSampath told us in a phone interview that “98% of all of the tests being done are molecular tests,” and those are “comparable” no matter where they are run.\n\nHe said at some point there will be data available to make comparative evaluations, but right now it “doesn’t exist.”\n\nUpdate, April 3: Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. has done more tests “than any other country anywhere in the world,” and he went even further on April 2, making the false claim that this was the case “both in terms of the raw number and also on a per capita basis the most.” Despite having conducted more than 1 million tests, the U.S. is still behind Germany, Italy and South Korea on a per-capita basis.\n\nA chart by Our World in Data shows those three countries had conducted significantly more tests per-million people than the United States as of April 1. The chart notes: “There are substantial differences across countries in terms of the units, whether or not all labs are included, the extent to which negative and pending tests are included and other aspects.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: BREAKING: In the U.S., we're facing two challenging paths with #COVID19—either we mirror South Korea's approach or risk an outcome similar to Italy's.

It’s a murky concept that hasn’t been defined in American law — as we’ll explain later.\n\nAs for the rumors hyping the idea that military rule is looming, the Facebook page for “Alternative Media Television” recently warned its more than 145,000 followers: “STORM IS COMING TO AMERICA!!!! MARTIAL LAW NEXT 24 HOURS!!!!!!”\n\nThat post linked to Alternative Media Television’s online store, which sells “emergency survival” gear and “emergency preparedness” food supplies.\n\nAlex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind the website Infowars.com, also has been pumping out misinformation on the issue while selling his own survivalist supplies, including face masks.\n\n“We are already under overlying fields, crisscrossing fields, of martial law,” Jones said in one recent video.\n\nJones was banned from Facebook in 2019 for violating the company’s policies on “dangerous individuals and organizations,” but he still maintains a website and posts videos to his own video-sharing platform. The video warning of martial law was viewed more than 100,000 times, according to metrics shown on the site.\n\nAnother conspiracy theorist who hawks doomsday preparation goods online, David Zublick, has claimed on his website and YouTube channel that “this is, basically, martial law.”\n\nThere has been no declaration of martial law nationally or in any state as of March 25.\n\nIn fact, Federal Emergency Management Administrator Peter Gaynor said at a briefing with the president’s coronavirus task force on March 22, “we’ve had a lot of disinformation circulating and I want to make sure that it’s understood that this is not martial law.”\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also has said he won’t institute martial law, and the Washington National Guard issued a statement on Twitter saying, “Let’s put aside the rumors about martial law or military rule. IT’S JUST NOT TRUE.”\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said that he didn’t expect martial law would be necessary, but acknowledged that it’s an option.\n\nAt a March 15 press briefing, a reporter noted that other states had been more forceful in closing down businesses and asked, “why not exercise your authority?” Newsom answered by saying: “[I]f you want to establish a framework of martial law, which is ultimate authority and enforcement, we have the capacity to do that, but we are not, at this moment, feeling that is a necessity.”\n\nNewsom may have been referring to his powers under the state’s Emergency Services Act. His office didn’t respond to a request for clarification, but a spokesman for the governor’s office, Brian Ferguson, has reportedly said: “We don’t want this to be scary for people. This is a humanitarian mission to support health and safety.”\n\nSo, martial law isn’t in effect and it’s not imminent. But it’s worth explaining what, exactly, this ill-defined term means.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme court summed it up in a 1946 decision stemming from martial law in Hawaii during World War II.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court, 1946: [T]he term ‘martial law’ carries no precise meaning. The Constitution does not refer to ‘martial law’ at all and no Act of Congress has defined the term. It has been employed in various ways by different people and at different times. By some it has been identified as ‘military law’ limited to members of, and those connected with, the armed forces. Others have said that the term does not imply a system of established rules but denotes simply some kind of day to day expression of a General’s will dictated by what he considers the imperious necessity of the moment… In 1857 the confusion as to the meaning of the phrase was so great that the Attorney General in an official opinion had this to say about it: ‘The Common Law authorities and commentators afford no clue to what martial law, as understood in England, really is. * * * In this country it is still worse.’ 8 Op.Atty.Gen. 365, 367. What was true in 1857 remains true today.\n\nBasically, martial law is the temporary replacement of civil government by the military during a period of unrest, explained David Glazier, a professor at Loyola Law School and former U.S. Navy officer.\n\nIt has rarely been used in the U.S., said William Banks, professor of law at Syracuse University. The last time was in Hawaii, when martial law was instituted following the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nBefore that, martial law had been declared a couple of times by governors in the early 20th century, Banks and Glazier said. Also, President Abraham Lincoln used it during the Civil War and General Andrew Jackson used it in New Orleans during the War of 1812.\n\nPost World War II, some circumstances have been mischaracterized as martial law, particularly civil rights-era actions, as when President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the National Guard in Arkansas to integrate schools in Little Rock. President John F. Kennedy did the same in Mississippi, and President Lyndon Johnson acted similarly to protect demonstrators marching from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama.\n\nAll of those actions were taken under the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to use the military to quell unrest.\n\nBut that’s the opposite of martial law, which exists only if there is no civil law. In those cases, “It’s entirely authorized by the law. That’s the point,” said Banks.\n\nGeoffrey Corn, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston and a former Army officer, put it another way — those cases used the military to supplement civil law.\n\nA much more common supplemental use of the National Guard is for help with humanitarian aid and law enforcement during natural disasters, Corn said.\n\nStill, it can be confusing to the public to see signs of military presence in their communities.\n\nFor example, Jonathan Rath Hoffman, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, was recently prompted to respond to a viral tweet showing a video clip of military vehicles that suggested they were an ominous sign of things to come.\n\n“[T]hese are new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles being transported by @USArmy Materiel Command from the factory in Oshkosh to Fort Bragg, NC. These deliveries by train to our bases nationwide are not infrequent and have nothing to do w COVID-19,” Hoffman tweeted.\n\nBut another post from Alternative Media Television had already amplified the misconception, claiming: “BREAKING!!! MILITARY VEHICLES MOVING INTO MAJOR CITIES!!! MARTIAL LAW IMMINENT!!” The video accompanying that post has been viewed more than 225,000 times.\n\nIn order to have martial law, Corn told us, there would need to be a complete breakdown of civil institutions. “As long as civil function continues,” Corn said, the courts will find “invocation of martial law is unconstitutional.”\n\nThe other experts we talked to agreed that national-scale martial law is exceedingly unlikely.\n\n“There’s no case whatsoever that civil authority has collapsed or come close to collapsing,” said Robert Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin Law School, explaining that there is no cause for instituting the “almost comically draconian step of martial law.”\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Tom Cotton in July 2020, after he called it “racially divisive” and “revisionist.”\n\nAs the U.S. grappled with its history of racism amidst police custody killings of Black people in 2020, The 1619 Project, an ongoing initiative named for the year that the first slave ship arrived on American shores, became the center of a debate. The educational curriculum was launched alongside The New York Times Magazine’s August 2019 special issue and aims to “reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.” Partnering with the Pulitzer Center, the curriculum is freely available online and is being used by teachers across the country. It includes essays, poems, photographs, and fiction from contributors, and was praised for its examination of slavery’s impact on the present day.\n\nAs Cotton launched an attack on the initiative by introducing legislation that would prevent the use of federal funds to spread the optional curriculum in classrooms, Snopes readers asked us if in his criticism of the project he had actually called slavery a “necessary evil.”\n\nHe did use those words. But he also claimed his meaning was misinterpreted.\n\nIn an interview with the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Cotton said [emphasis ours]:\n\nWe have to study the history of slavery and its role and impact on the development of our country because otherwise we can’t understand our country. As the Founding Fathers said, it was the necessary evil upon which the union was built, but the union was built in a way, as Lincoln said, to put slavery on the course to its ultimate extinction.\n\nLater, Cotton took to Twitter and appeared to clarify that he himself wasn’t backing the idea of slavery being a “necessary evil”:\n\nAlthough Cotton claimed he was citing the views of the founding fathers, there did not appear to be a record of them saying this exact phrase, according to CNN. But historians argued that some of the founding fathers believed slavery to be necessary, and more believed it to be evil, while others reported there was little overlap between the two perspectives.\n\nBut Nikole Hannah-Jones, writer and creator of The 1619 Project pushed back on his characterization of his own words and the views of the founding fathers, citing historian Joshua Rothman who categorically stated that slavery was a “choice” defended or accepted by white Americans for generations. Hannah-Jones argued that Cotton’s use of the word “as” denoted agreement with the statement. She also said that the curriculum was meant to be “supplementary” and was not intended to “supplant U.S. history curriculum.”\n\nIn summary, given that Cotton himself defended and clarified his use of the phrase “necessary evil,” we rate this claim as “Correct attribution.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Breaking News: Some founding fathers in 1787 actually believed slavery was necessary, while many thought it was evil—do folks agree today?\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you know?

Unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take these ignorant comments seriously. Look, there might be a cautionary lesson in LeBron for kids: This is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA. And it’s always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year to bounce a ball. Oh, and LeBron and Kevin? You’re great players but no one voted for you. Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, shut up and dribble.\n\nThe second clip comes from June 3, 2020, and shows Ingraham defending Drew Brees after the NFL star, a white man, said that he would “never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag” when he was asked about football players kneeling during the National Anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nWell he’s allowed to have his view of what kneeling and the flag means to him.

In speaking with some of you, it breaks my heart to know the pain I have caused. In an attempt to talk about respect, unity, and solidarity centered around the American flag and the national anthem, I made comments that were insensitive and completely missed the mark on the issues we are facing right now as a country.”\n\nIngraham addressed the controversy stemming from comparisons of her comments on Brees and James in a follow-up segment on June 5, in which she noted a “nuance between the two instances” and said, “Every American, every American has the God-given right to speak his mind on any issue.”", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Breaking news: Laura Ingraham's contrasting takes on LeBron James and Drew Brees showcase her strikingly different views on athletes and politics!\nRewritten Tweet 2: Unbelievable! 😮 Laura Ingraham once told LeBron James to \"shut up and dribble\" while defending Drew Brees' right to speak his mind.

Taqaddas can be heard blaming the immigration officer for missing her flight. Taqqadas tried to snatch her passport from the officer but when he resisted, she slapped him on the face.

{"query_id": 1.27776513973171e+18, "query": "I made a discovery (and yes you can try this at home)", "target": "An enormous variety of social media posts questioning the safety and efficacy of face masks to control the spread of COVID-19 have backed their claims by citing health authorities such as the World Health Organization (example), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (example), and Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (example). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency under the U.S. Department of Labor, has also been implicated in similar claims (example). As Health Feedback explains below, these claims are inaccurate and misleading.\n\nMask guidance was updated beginning in April 2020 in light of new scientific studies on COVID-19 transmission\n\nIt is true that the WHO and the CDC initially discouraged the public from wearing face masks due to concerns about a possible shortage, specifically surgical masks and N95 respirators, which are needed by healthcare workers at the frontlines of the COVID-19 response. These workers have the greatest risk of contracting the infection.\n\nThis guidance has since been reversed, but potential future equipment shortages have led the CDC to encourage the public to use cloth face masks rather than surgical masks or N95 respirators, as stated on its website, updated 28 June 2020:\n\nThe CDC’s change in guidance issued on 3 April was prompted by studies showing that individuals who did not appear to be ill, such as asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals, could still transmit COVID-19 to others[1-3]. The CDC has estimated that about 50% of COVID-19 cases are transmitted by presymptomatic individuals—those who are infected but not yet showing symptoms. As COVID-19 is most commonly transmitted through infectious droplets, which can be generated by coughing, sneezing, or talking[4], masks act as a simple physical barrier to block these droplets. In this way, masks can be beneficial for reducing COVID-19 transmission.\n\nThe WHO similarly updated its advice on mask use by the public on 5 June 2020:\n\nIn short, posts that cite WHO and CDC recommendations discouraging healthy individuals from using face masks are misleading because they are based on outdated recommendations. New evidence that changes our understanding of how COVID-19 can be transmitted has prompted health authorities to reverse their initial position on the use of masks. Authorities now encourage the general public to wear cloth masks when entering shared spaces, such as public transportation and grocery stores.\n\nIn order to ensure that cloth masks are safe to use and do not pose a transmission risk, the CDC has advised users to wash masks after each use, to ensure that they remove the mask correctly, and to wash their hands after handling or touching a used mask.\n\nOSHA’s standards for safe oxygen levels were taken out of context; OSHA recommends the use of face masks at work in line with CDC guidance\n\nSome purveyors of false or misleading social media posts have claimed that wearing a face mask would violate OSHA’s definition of a safe oxygen level. OSHA defines an oxygen-deficient environment as “any atmosphere that contains less than 19.5 percent oxygen”. Many individuals on social media filmed themselves performing a supposed test of the oxygen level inside their face mask by breathing into a gas sensor placed between their mouth and the mask. This “test” invariably showed an oxygen level reading that was below 19.5%, which was misinterpreted in the videos as indicating that masks produce an oxygen-deficient environment as defined by OSHA.\n\nFirstly, as several fact-checks have already explained, these videos use the devices improperly and therefore obtain an inaccurate reading of the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the air that a person breathes while wearing a mask. John Villalovos, an engineer at a company that produces these gas monitors, told Lead Stories that such devices are meant for sampling atmospheric air and require “anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute or two minutes” to provide an accurate reading. “The sensors are not going to be that fast to show the true action and content of air going in and the reduced oxygen going out,” he said. In other words, the gas sensors used in these videos are not intended for measuring rapid changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide levels between inhaled and exhaled air.\n\nSecondly, it is not physically possible for face masks to block the exchange of gas molecules through the mask material. Earlier reviews by Health Feedback pointed out that the pores in cloth masks, surgical masks, and N95 respirators are not small enough to block air flow. For example, an N95 respirator, which has a much more restrictive filter size compared to a surgical face mask or cloth face covering, filters out particles that are 0.3 microns (300 nanometers, or 300,000 picometers) or larger. In contrast, the size of carbon dioxide and oxygen molecules ranges between approximately 150 and 200 picometers, which is at least 1,000 times smaller than the filter size of the N95 respirator. Infectious droplets that carry the virus, on the other hand, range between 5 to 10 micrometers, which is at least 16 times larger than the N95 filter size.\n\nThe claim that wearing a face mask causes oxygen deficiency is also clearly contradicted by empirical evidence. Healthcare workers wear surgical masks and N95 respirators for long hours at work without any significant reported impacts to their work performance. Lack of oxygen or carbon dioxide toxicity causes symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, and loss of consciousness, which would have occurred had masks affected workers as claimed. Victoria Forster, a cancer researcher at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, stated the same in this Forbes article:\n\nIn fact, OSHA clearly recommends that people wear face masks at work in this excerpt from a Frequently Asked Questions page:\n\nDoctors have taken to social media to demonstrate that wearing a face mask does not affect their oxygen levels using a pulse oximeter, which measures the level of oxygen in the blood. According to Albert Rizzo, the chief medical officer for the American Lung Association, a normal level is around 95 to 97%. The health professionals in the following tweets maintained oxygen saturation levels of 98 and 100% while breathing through surgical masks:\n\nOther doctors used more unusual and extreme methods to illustrate the same point. Mark Lewis, the director of gastrointestinal oncology at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, wore an entire box’s worth of surgical masks at one go, yet his blood oxygen saturation read 99%:\n\nA doctor in the U.K. named Tom Lawton ran 35 kilometers (about 21 miles) while wearing a face mask. While he admitted it was “unpleasant”, he also reported that his oxygen levels, measured with a pulse oximeter, were “98 to 99 all the time, completely normal oxygen levels all the way.”\n\nHowever, there are instances where prolonged face mask use should be exercised with caution, for example by people with preexisting respiratory issues. The same caution also applies to cloth face coverings. Specifically, the CDC has indicated that:\n\nMasks can protect us from pathogens, but must also be applied with other measures such as hand washing and physical distancing\n\nSome Facebook posts and articles cited several studies which purportedly demonstrate that face masks do not protect us from respiratory diseases like COVID-19. An earlier Health Feedback review explained how one such post misrepresented research findings from a handful of studies.\n\nResearch gaps still exist regarding the efficacy of face masks, with some scientific reviews[5,6] cautioning that more research on masks is needed in order to better understand the efficacy of different types of masks in different contexts, for example between community and health care settings, as this Vox article pointed out. However, the evidence that has emerged so far suggests that masks are beneficial for reducing the transmission of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.\n\nAn April 2020 study published in Nature Medicine, examined the shedding of various respiratory viruses, including seasonal coronaviruses and influenza, by more than 100 infected individuals, as well as the efficacy of face masks in reducing the dissemination of infectious droplets[7]. The authors found that surgical masks reduced the detection of coronavirus and viral copies in large respiratory droplets and in aerosols, suggesting that masks can reduce viral transmission.\n\nAn April 2020 review published in the International Journal of Nursing Studies by MacIntyre and Chughtai analyzed 19 randomized controlled trials, among which eight were conducted in a community setting[5]. The review concluded that, “In the community, masks appear to be effective with and without hand hygiene, and both together are more protective.”\n\nA May 2020 study published in BMJ Global Health measured the incidence of secondary COVID-19 transmission in 124 families in Beijing, China. Each family had one member with a confirmed COVID-19 infection (primary case). The authors examined whether various interventions, specifically the use of disinfectants, physical distancing, and face masks, in a household reduced the risk of secondary transmission[8]. They found that all three interventions reduced secondary transmission of COVID-19. In particular, the authors noted that “Face mask use by the primary case and family contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79% effective in reducing transmission.”\n\nA systematic review and meta-analysis by Chu et al., published June 2020 in The Lancet, examined the efficacy of three interventions—physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection—in reducing the transmission of coronavirus infections (SARS, MERS, and COVID-19)[6]. The authors evaluated 39 studies on the efficacy of various face masks in reducing disease transmission and found that face masks reduced the risk of coronavirus infection compared to no mask wearing, and that N95 respirators “might be associated with a larger reduction in risk compared with surgical or similar masks.”\n\nDespite these findings suggesting that masks have a beneficial effect in reducing the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19, it is important to remember that masks do not provide complete protection from infection and people must still continue to practice physical distancing of six feet (about two meters) or more and good hand hygiene.\n• None Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Residents of a Long-Term Care Skilled Nursing Facility — King County, Washington, March 2020\n• None Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)\n• None The airborne lifetime of small speech droplets and their potential importance in SARS-CoV-2 transmission\n• None A rapid systematic review of the efficacy of face masks and respirators against coronaviruses and other respiratory transmissible viruses for the community, healthcare workers and sick patients\n• None Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis\n• None Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face masks\n• None Reduction of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households by face mask use, disinfection and social distancing: a cohort study in Beijing, China\n\nThis fact check is available at IFCN’s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"I've stumbled upon something amazing—try it at home and see for yourself! 🤔✨\"\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Breaking news: I discovered something that you can easily test at home! 🔍🏠\"\nRewritten Tweet 3: \"It's believed I've made a discovery—give it a try at your own place!\"\nRewritten Tweet 4: \"I might have found something interesting, and you can check it out at home!\"\nRewritten Tweet 5: \"Did you know?

The inmates of the Katzbach concentration camp, a part of the former Adler industrial factory, were forced into a death march to the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Dachau on March 24, 1945. Some 528 victims of Katzbach are buried at Frankfurt’s central cemetery.”\n\nThe people are therefore lying on the road as part of an art project in remembers of the Katzbach Nazi concentration camp.\n\nAlong with the viral image in the first claim, this Facebook page posted two other images. The second viral photo is a collage of three images which shows multiple coffins. The user wrote in Bengali, “Italy’s condition is very bad.

The report added that most migrants were from Eritrea and Somalia.\n\nThe third image posted by Bengali social media users is of a burial site surrounded by military and medical staff. It also shows several dead bodies being buried by medical staff dressed in a white coloured protective gear. After performing another reverse image search, we found that the viral image is a still is from the 2011 Hollywood film Contagion. It can also be viewed in the film’s official trailer at 2:19 mark.

You showed up in mass to insist that the state fund our public school legislative priorities,\" Jewell tweeted, along with two images.\n\nThe image on the left depicts a mighty crowd on Halifax Mall, the grassy field behind the legislature where ralliers congregated after marching through downtown Raleigh. Hardly any grass can be seen in the sea of red shirts — which was a red flag.\n\nOn Twitter, Jewell faced almost immediate pushback from some who alleged that the photo was altered. Earlier Wednesday, similar photos were posted (since deleted) on unverified Twitter accounts Organizing Action NC and the Student North Carolina Association of Educators at NC State University.\n\nA similar photo — perhaps the same photo — was also posted on the Facebook page for Red 4 Ed NC, a nonprofit group that advocates for educators. The photos were later removed.\n\nGiven the pushback to Jewell’s photo and how much it was shared on social media, PolitiFact wondered if it was authentic. We reached out to Jewell by email but didn’t immediately get a response. Our review found it shows clear signs of manipulation.\n\n\"There was a rally photo circulating yesterday of Halifax Mall that is believed to have been photo shopped according to media reports. I have since removed it from my sites,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe photo appears to have been snapped from the roof of the legislative building. The spot was popular for ralliers, journalists and politicians.\n\nNews & Observer reporter Dawn Vaughan tweeted video footage of the Halifax mall gathering. Reporter Leigh Tauss took photos of the Halifax mall for a story in Indyweek. Jeff Tiberii, a reporter for WUNC, tweeted similar photos and on Thursday tweeted his concern for altered images circulating on social media.\n\nBut the photos shared by Jewell and the Red 4 Ed Facebook page show less green space and more people than the photos shared by reporters on the scene — and were likely altered versions of a photo taken and tweeted by NC Rep. Grier Martin.\n\nThe image shared by Jewell and the photo shared by Martin show ralliers in the same positions.\n\nTurn your attention to the white tent. On the left side, a person wearing a red shirt and jean shorts is walking in the same position in both pictures. Near the pole on the right side of the tent, a person in a green shirt, white hat and khaki shorts is also positioned exactly the same in both photos.\n\nThere are other examples where people are in identical positions, but let’s look now at how Jewell’s image was doctored. Sections of the photo were copied and then duplicated to make the crowd seem larger than it was.\n\nAt the bottom-right side of the screen, there’s a person in a white shirt and a person in a blue shirt that appear twice in the photo. In the center of the crowd, signs in the same exact size, color and position appear more than once.\n\nChristiaan Triebert, a journalist on the visual investigations team at The New York Times, noticed the same similarities as PolitiFact. He said it appears \"that the crowd size was increased using the clone tool in Photoshop.\"\n\nIt’s unclear who doctored it. Martin told PolitiFact that he took the photo at 11:46 a.m. Wednesday and, apart from sharing it on Twitter, didn’t share it with anyone.\n\n\"I had no contact from anyone about my photo,\" Martin said in an email.\n\nJewell tweeted a photo that showed a sea of red education advocates covering most of the Halifax Mall, located behind the legislature. There was a crowd. However, the photo was altered to make the crowd look larger than it was in reality. We rate the statement False.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Mike Lee, R-Utah, said he disagreed with Trump.\n\n\"The intelligence I’ve seen suggests that this was ordered by the crown prince,\" Lee said on NBC News’ Meet the Press Nov. 25.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, was more cautious, but she told CNN’s State of the Union that \"when it becomes necessary, the president also needs to speak directly to the Saudis and say enough is enough.\"\n\nTrump released a statement about Saudi Arabia on Nov. 20. It contained a number of questionable assertions, and we’ll go through them here.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance.\"\n\nAfter more than four years of civil strife, the humanitarian disaster in Yemen is enormous. Out of a population of 28 million, 11.3 million are in acute need in order to survive, according to the latest U.N. estimates. More than 8 million people are at risk of famine.\n\nThe conflict involves many parties. The Houthi Shia Muslim rebel movement forced the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee in 2015. A Saudi-led coalition put Hadi’s government, with Hadi remaining outside the country, back in control of part of Yemen. Those are the two main armed groups, but the war has seen a changing mix of alliances with other factions.\n\nTrump called the conflict in Yemen a proxy war, so the fairest reading of his words is that if Iran stopped backing the Houthis, Saudi Arabia’s opponents, then the Saudis would follow up with aid. The implication is that the Houthi forces would either strike a deal or collapse.\n\nGerald Feierstein, former U.S. ambassador to Yemen in the Obama administration, said under either condition, Saudi Arabia has put relief money on the table. Feierstein said at some point before 2016, the Saudis told him they offered billions if the Houthis stood down.\n\n\"The Saudis and Emiratis have also said publicly that they would fund reconstruction and development programs in Yemen once the conflict ended,\" Feierstein told us.\n\nFeierstein said the Saudi offer amounted to about $9 billion.\n\nThe catch, according to former CIA officer Bruce Riedel at the Brookings Institution, is that the civil war in Yemen is more complicated than just Iranian and Hezbollah support for the Houthis –– a charge that Iran denies.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition wants to restore full power to Hadi, Riedel said. But groups that oppose the Houthis don’t necessarily want to see Hadi in control either.\n\n\"By placing the war solely as an Iranian-created conflict, Trump is trying to absolve the Saudis of responsibility,\" Riedel said.\n\n\"After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States.\"\n\nThe $450 billion Trump repeatedly mentions comes without evidence. We have asked the White House to show us what lies behind the $450 billion and have yet to get an answer.\n\nHossein Askari, a business professor at George Washington University, analyzes international trade in the Middle East. He knows of no tally of contracts to back up Trump’s assertion.\n\n\"There is absolutely no such number that could support the $450 billion,\" Askari said.\n\nPart of the total would be $110 billion in arms sales that Trump claimed emerged from his visit to Saudi Arabia. Arms analysts told us that, at best, the figure is aspirational.\n\n\"The $110 billion is not even remotely solid,\" said U.S. Naval War College professor Jonathan Caverley in October. \"The State Department only counts $14.5 billion in ‘implemented’ sales from this deal.\"\n\nThe $110 billion includes sales that have been in the pipeline from before the Trump administration took power. Complex weapons systems take years to play out.\n\nIn the past 10 years, the United States and Saudi Arabia have had $85.5 billion in sales agreements, but only $24.5 billion in actual deliveries.\n\nSome of the sales are speculative. For example, the United States approved the sale of a $13.5 billion Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. But the Saudis let a September deadline to seal the deal come and go.\n\nWhen Trump offered a version of this before, he suggested that over a million jobs were on the line. We rated that claim Pants on Fire.\n\n\"If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries — and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business.\"\n\nCould Saudi Arabia swap Russian or Chinese weapons for its American-made systems?\n\nNot likely, said Rachel Stohl, director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank.\n\n\"The Saudis have been reliant on U.S. and other Western governments’ weapons for years,\" Stohl told us. \"It would be extremely difficult — from a parts, integration, and interoperability perspective — to simply switch to Chinese and Russian suppliers. It would be a very slow transition for the military to resupply its major systems to Russian and Chinese platforms.\"\n\nIn theory, Saudi Arabia could buy elsewhere, but in practice, the Gulf State nation has many reasons not to.\n\n\"Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an ‘enemy of the state’ and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.\"\n\nTrump claims this in the statement, but a search of the Nexis news database shows no mention of Saudi representatives saying publicly that Khashoggi was an enemy of the state or a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Muslim group with chapters in many Arab countries.\n\nRiedel said it was a theme developed \"behind the scenes\" — perhaps by the Saudis themselves. But in the United States, Trump supporters began spreading the idea.\n\nFox News host Harris Faulkner said Oct. 18 that \"Khashoggi was tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.\" A conservative talk show CRTV tweeted a segment that said Khashoggi \"was a radical activist with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood!\" Donald Trump Jr. sent his followers a tweet that built on the message that Khashoggi was \"tooling around Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda co-founder Abdullah Azzam.\"\n\nThe reality is that many years earlier, Khashoggi had been drawn to Islamic movements, but he later distanced himself from radical movements. He met Osama bin Laden when, with CIA backing, bin Laden was fighting the Russians in Afghanistan. Khashoggi reported on him as a journalist.\n\nWhen U.S. forces killed bin Laden, Khashoggi wrote of him, \"You were beautiful and brave in those beautiful days in Afghanistan, before you surrendered to hatred and passion.\"\n\nSo perhaps Saudi officials told Trump that Khashoggi was a threat to the Saudi kingdom, but so far as anyone can tell, that was in private.\n\n\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event — maybe he did and maybe he didn’t!\"\n\nAccording to news reports, the CIA has concluded that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi’s assassination. \"The CIA’s assessment, in which officials have said they have high confidence, is the most definitive to date linking Mohammed to the operation,\" the Washington Post reported.\n\nLawmakers publicly sided with the CIA’s interpretation over Trump’s.\n\nEchoing Lee, his Republican colleague, the incoming House Intelligence chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., said on CNN’s State of the Union that he has been briefed by the CIA, \"and while I cannot discuss the contents of the briefing in any way, I can say that I think the president is being dishonest with the American people.\"\n\nSteven Aftergood, an intelligence specialist at the Federation of American Scientists, told PolitiFact that intelligence inherently \"deals in uncertainties. So one could still say of almost any conclusion, ‘maybe he did and maybe he didn't!’ But this is a way of evading the substance of the judgment, which is that he almost certainly did order the assassination.\"\n\n\"I understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction — and they are free to do so.\"\n\nIt’s not clear what political advantage members of Congress would find in opposing Trump’s stance on Saudi Arabia. Several lawmakers explicitly cited human rights as a reason for their concerns. For instance:\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.: \"The President indicates that Saudi Arabia is the lesser two evils compared to Iran and so the U.S. won’t punish Saudi Arabia for the brutal killing and dismemberment of a dissident journalist in their consulate. I disagree.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.: \"Our foreign policy must be about promoting our national interests. It is in our natl interest to defend human rights. (Human-rights) violations lead to mass migration, help extremism flourish & often result in new governments hostile towards the U.S. because we supported their oppressors.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va.: \"The President’s failure to hold Saudi Arabia responsible in any meaningful way for the death of Jamal Khashoggi is just one more example of this White House’s retreat from American leadership on issues like human rights and protecting the free press.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.: \"I’m shocked that President Trump said there will be no punishment for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi… Human rights is more than just a phrase, it has to mean something. And that means standing up and condemning a brazen murder by a foreign government. Everyone who played a role in this killing must be held accountable.\"\n\nThe breadth of lawmakers’ expressed concern for human rights is unusually strong, advocates say.\n\n\"The strongly negative, bipartisan reaction to President Trump’s statement reflects widespread revulsion at the idea that the United States would be willing to avert its eyes from a blatant, gruesome murder,\" said Rob Berschinski, senior vice president for policy with the advocacy group Human Rights First.\n\nF. Gregory Gause, who heads the international affairs department at Texas A&M University’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, said the critics of Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi’s killing tend to fall into two categories.\n\nOne group, he said, are lawmakers \"who have always thought that human rights and democracy should play a greater role in our Middle East policy and thus have always been critical of Saudi Arabia.\" The other are lawmakers \"who have been supportive of the relationship with Saudi Arabia for strategic reasons, but find the crown prince’s behavior beyond the pale and want the Trump administration to try to use leverage with Riyadh to isolate, and maybe even remove, the crown prince.\"\n\n\"After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels — so important for the world.\"\n\nTrump is correct about Saudi Arabia ranking second in the world in oil production, as this chart shows.\n\nHe also has a point that Saudi Arabia has agreed to increase oil production in recent weeks. That commitment came after the news of Khashoggi’s killing, said Anna Mikulska, a fellow at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University’s Baker Institute.\n\n\"Following this commitment, the prices of crude started falling,\" she said. (See a related fact-check.)\n\nHowever, that’s not the only cause of lower oil prices, experts said.\n\nOil production by the United States has experienced a larger net increase than the entire production increase from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, of which Saudi Arabia is part).\n\nOther countries have also increased their production, including Russia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMeanwhile, on the demand side, a big reason for the decline is the expectation that the global economy will slow, leaving too much oil and not enough customers, said Paul J. Sullivan, an economics professor in the Eisenhower School at the National Defense University.\n\nIn addition, oil is priced in dollars, and the increasing strength of the dollar has made oil cheaper, Sullivan said.\n\nAll told, there are \"hundreds of other economic factors\" that played into oil prices outside of Saudi Arabia, Sullivan said.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: \"Our foreign policy should undoubtedly prioritize national interests and unequivocally defend human rights! ⚖️🚨 Violations lead to mass migration and embolden extremism, resulting in new, potentially hostile governments. 🇺🇸❌\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: \"Did you know?

This was a landmark day for those workers as the #USMCA passed the Senate and is now awaiting President Trump’s signature.", "target": "President Donald Trump fulfilled one of his campaign promises in January 2020 when he signed a revised North American Free Trade Agreement into law.\n\nThe revised deal, known as the USMCA -- United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- is a replacement for NAFTA, which Trump described as \"one of the worst trade deals\" in history.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the signing of the new agreement, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle weighed in, including Wisconsin’s U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah, who expressed his support on Twitter.\n\n\"In #WI, over 44,000 jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada,\" Grothman said in a Jan. 16, 2020 tweet.\n\nThe tweet also featured a graphic, attributed to the National Association of Manufacturers, which read: \"In Wisconsin 44,361 jobs depend on manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico.\"\n\nWell, yes and no. It depends if you think it’s accurate to say the Milwaukee Bucks have won more than 10 games this year … when at the All-Star Break they had won 46.\n\nAccording to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Wisconsin’s top two export markets for 2019 were Canada ($6.7 billion) and Mexico ($3.3 billion). Those far outpace China, which held down the No. 3 spot at $1.4 billion.\n\nThe top Wisconsin export products in 2019 were industrial machinery ($5.6 billion), electric machinery ($2.4 billion) and medical and scientific instruments ($2.0 billion).\n\nWhen asked for backup for the claim, Grothman staff member Timothy Svoboda pointed to the National Association of Manufacturers graphic as well as the group’s website, which includes the 44,361 number.\n\nThe wrinkle: Grothman’s claim spoke of jobs in general that depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, not just manufacturing jobs which -- obviously -- is a smaller segment.\n\nAs such, he vastly undershoots his target. Grothman’s omission of the word \"manufacturing\" is an example of how a word omission can significantly change the veracity of a statement.\n\nIn a phone call with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Grothman acknowledged the mixup.\n\nIn a Jan. 29, 2020 news release after Trump signed the trade deal, he offered a more accurate total, saying under the deal \"the 231,000 Wisconsin jobs and nearly $11 billion worth of Wisconsin exports supported by trade with Canada and Mexico will be provided a better playing field.\"\n\nIn a tweet, Grothman said that in Wisconsin \"over 44,000 jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada.\"\n\nHe actually undershoots the mark, since the 44,000 applies only to manufacturing jobs. The real total of jobs tied to Canada and Mexico trade is 231,000.\n\nTo be sure, 231,000 jobs is more than the 44,000 jobs claimed in the tweet. But it could also give the impression that only 44,000 jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico -- a figure that is off the mark by an estimated 187,000 jobs, or 80.9%\n\nPolitiFact’s definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate or leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

The issues include taxes, health care, the Green New Deal, federal abortion funding, the death penalty, and guns.\n\n\"It’s official, the Democrat Party is now deciding which near octogenarian career politician will be their nominee,\" the email said. \"And those aren’t the only similarities between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. … There is no so-called ‘moderate’ option for Democrats. Just radicalism.\"\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at the email, issue by issue. Here’s what we found.\n\nClaims from the email that inaccurately equate Biden’s and Sanders’ positions\n\nClaim: \"Biden: The ‘the first thing I would do’ is raise middle class taxes. Bernie says he will raise taxes on anyone making over $29,000.\"\n\nOne of Sanders’ options for paying for his Medicare for All proposal is to add an additional 4 percentage points to existing income tax rates for those who earn more than $29,000. So while this is not a guarantee, it is one option Sanders has suggested.\n\nBiden hasn’t proposed anything like this. In fact, his tax plan would increase the top marginal rate from 37% to 39.6%, affecting those who earn more than $400,000 — not exactly a middle-class income level. Other aspects of Biden’s tax plan target provisions of special interest to higher-income individuals and corporations, such as capital gains taxes, corporate tax rates, and additional payroll taxes for high earners.\n\nWhen we asked the RNC about the assertion about Biden, they pointed to a June 2019 debate in which NBC’s Savannah Guthrie asked all candidates to raise their hand \"if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.\" Biden and Sanders, among others, raised their hands.\n\nHowever, this glosses over some nuances in their positions.\n\nSanders would provide coverage to undocumented immigrants under his single-payer insurance plan; he has tweeted, \"If you are a human being, regardless of your immigration status, you have a right to health care.\"\n\nBiden would not go quite that far.\n\nUnder Biden’s proposal, undocumented immigrants would be able to buy insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — from which they are currently barred — but would not be able to receive federal subsidies that make these plans affordable. If undocumented immigrants bought plans without subsidies, they wouldn’t be receiving government health care, as the email claims — they would be signing up for private insurance plans in the marketplace.\n\nClaim: \"Biden supports a government takeover of health care. Not only does Biden’s plan not allow Americans to keep their private health insurance, it guarantees ‘massive disruptions to private coverage.’ Bernie supports a government takeover of health care. Bernie’s health care agenda eliminates private health insurance.\"\n\nSanders would create a single-payer system in which the government acts as the health insurer for everyone, effectively supplanting most private insurance. This plan would \"provide everyone in America with comprehensive health care coverage, free at the point of service,\" Sanders’ campaign website says.\n\nBiden offers a more modest alternative, in which individuals could voluntarily buy in to the federal Medicare program for their insurance. Under Biden’s proposal, private insurance would remain part of the health insurance market. \"Instead of starting from scratch and getting rid of private insurance, he has a plan to build on the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate,\" Biden’s campaign website says.\n\nThis is substantially misleading. Sanders would \"guarantee tuition and debt-free public colleges, universities,\" trade schools, and historically black colleges. Biden’s proposals apply only to community colleges. Biden would provide \"two years of community college or other high-quality training program without debt for any hard-working individual.\"\n\nClaims from the email that are wrong about the positions of both Biden and Sanders\n\nBiden and Sanders have both said they support an official process to study the question of whether the descendants of slaves should receive reparations, but it’s too strong a statement to say they support the idea.\n\nAs recently as 2019, Sanders was dismissive of reparations, but he later announced his support for a bill that would establish a commission to study the issue.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, told the Washington Post that his administration would \"study how reparations may be part of\" efforts to curb racism \"and ensure the voices of descendants are central when gathering data and information.\" The Biden campaign also told Vice that he thinks the U.S. should \"gather the data necessary to have an informed conversation about reparations.\"\n\nClaims from the email that accurately portray Biden’s and Sanders’ positions\n\nClaim: \"Biden promised to end illegal immigration detention ‘across the board,’ and to not deport illegal immigrants who have committed felony-like offenses in other countries. Bernie backs a moratorium on all deportations of illegal immigrants in U.S. and says that it is not ‘appropriate’ to deport illegal immigrants not following law in the U.S.\"\n\nThis is largely accurate. The email cites a comment by Biden at a Vice News event when he was asked, \"How exactly would you detain immigrants?\" He said, \"I would not retain them behind bars … They show up, and you have an ankle bracelet (and) you set a hearing. We have to surge to the border, to the areas where people are being held. Get rid of all the cages, everybody out of prisons. The most you put on is an ankle bracelet, and you give a date when you show up for an immigration hearing, and you show up.\" Asked whether that was for adults and children, Biden said, \"across the board.\"\n\nThe email also cited a separate town hall comment by Biden in which he promised that in his first 100 days in office, deportations would only be carried out for felonies committed in the United States.\n\nSanders, for his part, says on his website that he would \"dismantle\" deportation programs and detention centers and \"institute a moratorium on deportations until a thorough audit of past practices and policies is complete.\"\n\nClaim: \"Biden supports the Green New Deal, \"radical decarbonization,\" and eliminating fossil fuels even if that means sacrificing hundreds of thousands of blue-collar jobs. Bernie supports the Green New Deal, eliminating fossil fuels, and is okay with sacrificing American jobs for his climate agenda.\"\n\nSanders is a proud supporter of the Green New Deal — he is a leading co-sponsor of the Senate version of the resolution, which is an aspirational document that sets goals for combating climate change through reductions in carbon emissions, increased energy efficiency, and expansions of clean-energy infrastructure.\n\nBiden isn’t as vocal a supporter of the legislation specifically, but he has name-checked the plan on his campaign website and echoed some of its language in his climate change policy.\n\n\"Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face,\" Biden’s campaign website says. \"It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.\" Among other things, Biden seeks to achieve a \"100% clean energy economy\" later than 2050.\n\nThe email is also correct that Biden responded affirmatively to a question in a Democratic debate that he’s OK with thousands or even hundreds of thousands of job losses in carbon-based energies as part of the transition to renewable energy.\n\nClaim: \"Biden supports federal funds for abortions after repealing the Hyde Amendment. Bernie supports federal funding for abortions as well as the repealing of the Hyde Amendment.\"\n\nRepealing the decades-old Hyde Amendment — which bars the use of federal funds for abortions — is a goal Biden and Sanders share. Biden is a relatively recent convert to this position. After sustaining attacks from other Democratic presidential candidates, including Sanders, Biden announced in June 2019 that he would be seeking an end to the restriction.\n\nClaim: \"Biden supports an end to the death penalty. Bernie wants to end the death penalty.\"\n\nThis is another issue both candidates agree on. Biden’s campaign website says that he would \"eliminate the death penalty\" by ending it at the federal level and encourage states to do the same. Death row inmates would instead serve life sentences without parole.\n\nThe two candidates agree on this as well. Biden’s website says he supports a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons. He would also seek to tighten regulation of existing assault weapons and pursue buybacks.\n\nSanders’ proposals are essentially identical: Banning the sale and distribution of assault weapons, tightening regulations and implementing a buyback program.\n\nThe Republican National Committee said in a mass email that on about a dozen issues, there is \"no daylight between\" Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.\n\nThe email accurately portrays the candidates’ similarities on roughly half of the issues cited, including their positions on federal abortion funding, ending the death penalty, banning assault weapons, and the Green New Deal.\n\nHowever, the email is incorrect on a similar number of other issues, including taxes, health care, free college tuition, and reparations for slavery.\n\nOn balance, we rate the statement Half True.", "rewrites": "Rewritten Tweet 1: Sen. claims he doesn't support reparations for slave descendants due to other \"more effective ways\" than \"handing out checks\": “Our priority should be solving American crises.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 2: Breaking: Sen. says no to reparations, suggesting \"better ways\" to address community issues rather than \"writing checks.\"\n\nRewritten Tweet 3: Unbelievable! 😮 Sen. believes that reparations are not as effective as other solutions for American community crises!\n\nRewritten Tweet 4: Sen. reportedly thinks reparations aren't the best solution, favoring other methods over \"just writing out a check\" for addressing crises.\n\nRewritten Tweet 5: Did you know?

I voted NO on the omnibus, read my full statement:", "target": "Army soldiers participating in a live-fire exercise in Oklahoma last month. Military spending has decreased in recent years.\n\nWASHINGTON — As President Trump prepared on Friday to sign a $1.3 trillion spending bill, just hours after threatening to veto it, he offered a few misleading and selectively worded claims to explain why he was reluctantly authorizing the legislation. “We looked at the veto. I looked very seriously at the veto. I was thinking about doing the veto,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “But because of the incredible gains that we’ve been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our — any of our thinking.” But his explanation did not accurately describe just why those gains were enough to ultimately approve the spending bill. Nor did it correctly demonstrate why the legislation did not include programs that he had prioritized. Here’s a fact-check.\n\nMore important, military pay increases are, by law, tied to the employment cost index, which measures private-sector wages — although the president or Congress can ask for more or less. The Pentagon requested, and Congress enacted, pay increases smaller than the index’s growth rate from 2014 through 2016. But both before and after that time — from 2011 to 2013 and 2017 to 2018 — pay for troops rose at the exact rate as the index grew. Mr. Trump’s proposed budgets for 2017 and 2018 had requested pay increases of 1.6 percent and 2.1 percent — rates that were lower than the statutory formula, and that were ultimately ignored by Congress. “For the last eight years, deep defense cuts have undermined our national security. If you look at what’s taken out, they’ve hallowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk.” Mr. Trump accurately noted that military officials had expressed concern about degraded troop readiness and delayed modernization of supplies. Both are what officials have described as consequences of protracted combat and budget restrictions, known as sequestration, that were imposed by Congress.\n\nIt’s worth noting that military spending has decreased in recent years, after the United States withdrew combat troops from Iraq in 2011. Adjusted for inflation, total military spending swelled to more than $774 billion in the 2010 fiscal year from roughly $400 billion in the 2000 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That period was the peak of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the wars wound down, so did military spending, which declined to $583 billion by the 2017 fiscal year. War-related spending aside, the Pentagon base budget alone was still larger in 2017 than it was in 2007 or 1997. Over all, the United States spends more on its military than the next seven countries combined. “I can tell you this, and I say this to DACA recipients that the Republicans are with you. They want to get your situation taken care of. The Democrats fought us. They just fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill.” In September, Mr. Trump moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program began by President Barack Obama that shielded eligible young undocumented immigrants from deportation and gave them the right to work. It is highly misleading to suggest that Democrats “fought” efforts to solidify the program into law. Democratic leaders have rejected Mr. Trump’s demand to pair the program with funding for a border wall, but that is not nearly the same as not wanting a legislative solution at all. Democrats met with Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers in January to discuss a deal, during which Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, suggested a “clean DACA bill.” At the meeting, Mr. Trump agreed.", "rewrites": "I'm sorry, but the information provided in the fact-check seems incomplete or unrelated to the tweet.
