After substantial media coverage, the Congress Government allegedly sent eight trucks with biscuits and mineral water, adorned with large posters of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. However, the truck drivers reportedly sold the supplies to cover unpaid hiring charges and fuel costs.

I had two elder brothers and a younger sister.  We lived in a small hut that leaked when it rained.\n\nMy parents worked in the mines for meager wages because they could not find another job.  It was a very messy job.\n\nWhen I was four years old, my father, mother and two brothers were bedridden with various ailments.\n\nLittle did they know at the time that the disease was caused by inhaling the deadly mica dust in the mines.\n\nWhen I was five, my brothers died of an illness.\n\nWith a small sigh the Collector stopped talking and wiped her eyes with her handkerchief.\n\nMost days our diet consisted of *plain water and one or two rotis*.

Can you imagine a village without a school, a hospital or even a toilet, without electricity?  .\n\nOne day my father grabbed \nmy starved, skin and bones hand and walked me to a big mine covered with tin sheets.\n\nIt was a mica mine that had gained notoriety over time.\n\nIt was an ancient mine that was dug up and dug up,  extending seemingly endlessly into the underworld.  My job was to crawl through the tiny caves at the bottom and collect mica ores.  It was only possible for children under the age of ten.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I ate a full stomach of rotis.  But that day I vomited.\n\nAt the time I should be in first class, I was collecting mica in dark rooms where I was breathing *poisonous dust*.\n\nIt was not uncommon for unfortunate children to die in occasional *landslides*.  And occasionally some with *fatal diseases*\n\nAfter working eight hours a day, you could earn at least enough for a one time meal.  I had become thinner and dehydrated because of hunger and inhalation of poisonous gases, every day.\n\nA year later my sister also started going to work in the mine.  As soon as they were a little better, it came to a point that my father, mother, sister and I worked together and we could live without hunger.\n\nBut fate was beginning to haunt us in another form.  One day when I was not going to work due to high fever, it suddenly rained.  Hundreds of people died when the mine collapsed on the workers at the base of the mine.  Among them were my father, mother and sister.\n\nTears began to flow through both eyes of Rani.  Everyone in the audience forgot to even breathe.  The eyes of many were filled with tears.\n \nYou have to remember that I was only six years old.\n\nEventually I arrived at the Government Agati Mandir.  There I was educated.

It only shows the interest of making India a great country.  To this man, the sole goal is to make India supreme.  If this person is not stopped, then in the future it will happen that one day when India will become a powerful nation in the whole world and then it will overwhelm America too.\n\n He is pursuing a particular strategy and no one understands what his strategy is.  Behind his smiling face is hidden a dangerous nationalist patriot.  He is using all the countries of the world for the benefit of India.\n\n The US will end its dominance in Asia by severing ties with Pakistan and Afghanistan, befriending its enemies like Vietnam, and now Modi will be seen using three countries against China.\n Beginning to produce oil in the South China Sea in Vietnam, all the oil from there is given to India, and the Indian company Reliance was forced to operate, here too American domination, will come to an end.\n At the moment, China's enemy is US control over Vietnam, which is to India's advantage.  .\n By pitting China and the United States against each other, India has invested ‡•® 1.2 trillion from both the countries which India could not get in eight years.\n\n Today, this man is turning Pakistan into a beggar country by turning it over to his old allies, such as the port in Iran, which is close to the Afghan border, and the Indian military station on the Afghan border.  Iran has also been given the opportunity to trade with India, paving the way for Pakistan to go to Afghanistan.\n Sections 370 and 35A were repealed and Pakistan was brought to its knees.  Now one day POK will take over the whole of Kashmir to India.  And Pakistan will fall into four parts.  And K will dance at the behest of Modi.\n Saudi Arabia, Pakistan's traditional ally, will also be instrumental in separating Pakistan from Pakistan.\n\n This man has ended the dominance of China and the US over Asia and shown his power to the world by canceling the SAARC summit.\n Modi has succeeded in establishing India's dominance over Asia ...\n This has been achieved by befriending two great powers in Asia, Russia and Japan. And China's decline has begun.  Two months ago, China realized that Modi could wipe out China's name today by launching a four-pronged attack if China tried to raise its voice with India.  Now China has to separate Hong Kong.  Modi is ready to take over POK to block CPEC, so China is ready to give up to 40% share to India by calling Modi today, but Modi is not in the mood to listen, so Modi has kept Pakistan as a beggar without a war.  As a result, China's 62 62 billion is in the water.\n\n By lobbying in the US government, Modi has given India a place in the M TCR group.  And in a short span of time, Modi will also secure the country's place in the NSG.  Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation.  Moreover, this person has taken Indian politics to a different level.\n The world should think that all countries have many enemies of each other, but India has no enemy other than Pakistan.  The solution is almost certain in India.\n This guy can use tactics like surgical strikes.  This man is doing more damage to Pakistan than the actual war.\n By using Muslim countries against Pakistan, Modi has proved that he is a great leader in the world today.\n In all these conspiracies, the cunning of this person is like paying attention.

YOU ARE IN FOR SURPRISES....\n\n*Know Christian Leaders of India*  \n(Hidden under the guise of Hindu name) \n\nArvind Kejriwal is not a Hindu but a Crypto Christian.  He got converted to Christianity while working with Mother Teresa. He was also allowed to go to that part of the Vatican, where only Christians can go. When Mother Teresa was being given the title of saint,  then the Vatican had invited only Arvind Kejriwal from among the Chief Ministers of the whole of India.\n\n The word 'crypto' in Greek means hidden or secret. \"Crypto Christian\" means Secret-Christian...!  The important aspects in this are:\n\n * Crypto-christian is not an abusive or negative word. Crypto-Christianity is an institutional practice of Christianity in a country in which Christians live under the basic principle of crypto-Christianity.  There they worship the God of that country as a show, follow the religion that country which is their camouflage.  But in reality they are Christians inside and continue to preach Christianity continuously.\n\n * The earliest examples of crypto Christians are found in the Roman Empire  when Christianity had set its feet in Rome in the early stages.  The great Roman emperor Trajan immediately saw Christianity as a threat to Roman culture as many Romans had become Christians. He  proposed to them, \"either leave Christianity or suffer the death penalty\".  Roman Christians pretended to leave Christianity to avoid the death penalty.  And after that they continued to worship Roman Gods and Goddesses superficially.  But they believed in Christianity from inside.  \n\n*  This is similar to the Muslims when they are 5-10 percent.  Then follow the laws of that country.  But when they are 20-30 percent,  the demand for Shariat begins.  Riots happen.  Ethnic cleansing of non-Muslims starts as the population increases further.\n\n * But crypto Christians do not commit violence like Muslims.  When Crypto Christian is less than 1 percent, he keeps doing his work by adopting the God of that country.  As and when they become more in number, they start insulting the same deities.  Hollywood's famous film Agora (2009) every Hindu must see. It shows, how when crypto Christians became more in number in Rome, they started insulting Roman Gods and Goddesses. \n\n* At present, in India also crypto Christians have taken hold.  So, here also the work of abusing Hindu deities, Brahmins has started. Means, the work which happened 2000 years ago in Europe is happening today in India. \n\n* Recently  Professor Kedar Mandal called Goddess Durga as a prostitute. \n\n * There are many such crypto -Christians in India.  They are amongst us, wearing the mask of secularism, leftism and Buddhism.  The Christian population in India is officially 20 million.  And it will not be surprising if 100 million Christians come out in India.  The estimated Christian population in Punjab alone is above 10 percent.  Many Christians of Punjab are under the camouflage of Sikhism, wear a turban.  They also wear beard, kirpan, kada, and follow Sikhism.  But they are all secret-Christians.\n\n * Many crypto-Christians have Hindu names to take reservation.  In these, the names of many are on Gods like Ram, Krishna, Shiva, Durga etc., whom even the people of the Sangh cannot understand as non-Hindu even in dreams. \n \n* Former President\n K R Narayanan was a crypto-christian, who was a Dalit throughout his life for receiving all the benefits of reservation.  And when he died, we saw the process of burial according to Christianity.  \n\n* So understood that this is crypto-Christian.  There are many such crypto-Christians in the country.  Those who are only increasing the agenda of Vatican by attacking Hinduism in Hindu names. We see such crypto-Christians every day in everyday life.  But they can't be understood as they hide under the camouflage of Hindu names.  \n\n * Congress leader  Ambika Soni, who described Shri Ram as fictional, is a crypto Christian.

At this rate, by 2050, Muslims will be the majority in India.\n\n  No one will stop India from becoming a Muslim country and India will immediately burn in the fire of riots.  We Muslims will kill Hindus and bring them to an end.  Today, according to government figures, Muslims make up about 20% of the population, but in reality they exceed 25%.\n\n  Government figures are inaccurate because Wahhabi Muslims deliberately conceal real numbers and do not register this growing population as their weapon to keep Kafir Hindus unaware.\n\n  Great fraud is going on in India in the name of secularism, but unfortunate Hindus are still in a deep sleep.\n  Why did the Hindus not learn a lesson by looking at Kashmir, where the Hindus had to leave all their wealth and women and girls behind.\n\n  India is secular as long as Hindus are in the majority, they do not know what will happen to them when they are a minority ????\n\n  These stupid Hindus do not even understand this from the statistics of the infidels of Pakistan and Bangladesh.  \"\n\n  The Hindu will never speak, will remain silent, will take a high moral position, ..... So, his destiny will surely sink ....\n\n  Pakistan and Bangladesh or Kashmir .. For example, Hindus are sure to come to an end.\n\n  Consider the Muslim-majority areas of Kerala, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad and other states.\n\n  Never go to an area where there are Muslim people in your city, you may be holding your breath between their staring eyes!\n\n  Apart from this, countries like Zambia and Malaysia are examples.\n\n  With the arrival of the Muslim majority, these secular countries were declared Islamic countries.\n\n  Violence occurs daily in countries such as London, Sweden, France and Norway.  \"\n\n  Have you ever wondered why this is happening?  Who does ??  What is the purpose ??\n\n  It is part of the peacekeeping tactic to create such panic among the people and instill fear without the courage to speak in their hearts!

They take a pledge and decide to finish you 5 times a day .... !!!\n\n  Therefore, closing the eyes and mouth is not effective.

Whether it is greenery or snow, wherever the eyes go, they remain wide open in wonder.\n\nSwitzerland is the richest country in the world! \n\nTelling you an interesting story of this country which is rich in every way.\n\nAbout 50 years ago, a private bank was established in Switzerland named *'Swissbank'*.\n\nThis bank rules were different from other banks in the world.\n\nThis Swissbank used to charge its customers money in exchange for safe keeping their money, its maintenance and privacy.\n\nThey guaranteed privacy. Never asked customer where did the money come from? No question, no obligation.\n\nThis bank's reputation had spread worldwide over the year. Swiss Bank had become the first choice of thieves, dishonest leaders, mafia, smugglers and big businessmen.\n\nThe bank had only one rule.\n\nJust like a recharge card, a number is given to the account holder, and a password is set.\n\nBank knew only 'that person who had that number'.\n\nNo other details were asked about the customer or his antecedents.\n\nBut\n\nThere was a rule of the bank that if there was no transaction for seven years or the account was not used for seven years, the bank will seize the account and deposit the money with the authorities.\n\nMoney accumulated in the Swissbank, where no transaction had occured for seven years, had piled up.\n\nDon't know how many mafia are killed every day in the world. Leaders are caught and prosecuted. How many smugglers are caught or killed, how many get life imprisonment.\n\nIn such a situation, I don't know how many accounts were seized in the bank.\n\nBank opened such accounts on the occasion of the new century of 2000.\n\nSo all the unaccounted black money they got was equal to 40% of the whole world's black money.\n\nAlmost half of the whole world's black money.\n\nThis amount was even beyond  their imagination.\n\nEven the bank was not able to decipher what to do with this amount. \n\nThey kept thinking what to do with this enormous wealth?\n\nThinking about this, the bank made an announcement and\nsought opinion from all the citizens of Switzerland, as what to do with this amount.\n\nAnd the bank declared that If the citizens of the country so desired, the bank can distribute this amount to each of them. And each citizen will get a million Euros.\n\nIn the 15-day survey by the government, 99.2% of the people had an opinion that the amount should be spent in enhancing the beauty of the country and towards tourism development and offering comforts to foreign tourists.\n\nSurvey results may be shocking for us, Indians!\n\nBut it was a very simple decision for patriotic Switzerland public.\n\nThey rejected the *haram* money. This was a clear survey to say that \"we don't want freebies\".\n\nNot only did they refuse free money, but on 25 January 2000, the people of Switzerland were standing outside the government survey channel with banners demanding that 0.8% of the people who wanted free money, the bank make their names public.\n\nThis they considered a stigma on society and Switzerland.\n\nAfter a lot of assurances by the government to punish those who wanted free monies, the public calmed down.\n\nAnd here, we want everything to be given free in India. Even when given free, we do not keep it safe. Apart from this, the sense of entitlement, tax thefts, electricity thefts, laziness to work, government jobs with no accountability, lack of civic sense, absence of duty towards one's country, corrupt politicians etc. are the major factors which are derailing development in the country.", "normalised": "Normalised Claim: The story claims that about 50 years ago, a private bank called Swissbank was established in Switzerland, which became known for its privacy and lack of questions about the source of funds.

A survey was conducted in Switzerland, and 99.2% of the citizens reportedly preferred to use the money for the country's tourism development rather than receiving it personally. The story contrasts this with the perceived entitlement and corruption in India."}

First, the Omicron variant does not confer immunity, meaning reinfection is possible. Second, the concept of coexisting with the virus is incorrect according to experts. People are advised to strengthen epidemic prevention measures, as the virus can unpredictably change within the human body. The virus has mutated, and the vaccine has not been updated, reducing its protective efficacy. Consequently, receiving three doses may not prevent diagnosis, severe illness, or death. It is important to protect oneself from infection to maintain health. There is a global need for caution. The new COVID-Omicron BA.4, an extension of the BA.5 variant, is reportedly more deadly and difficult to detect. Its symptoms include joint pain, headache, neck and upper back pain, pneumonia, and a general lack of appetite, without the typical cough or fever. This variant is said to be five times more virulent than Delta, with a higher mortality rate. It progresses rapidly to severe illness, often without obvious symptoms. Unlike previous strains, it does not settle in the nasopharynx but directly affects the lungs. Nasal swab tests frequently yield false negatives, allowing the virus to spread in the community and cause viral pneumonia and acute respiratory stress. To protect against this virulent strain, it is recommended to avoid crowded places, maintain a distance of 1.5 meters even outdoors, wear a double-layer mask, and wash hands frequently.

Telephone facility was available only for 20 rulers (kings) in this country. There was no drinking water supply. There were  only 10 small dams. No hospitals, no educational institutions, No fertilisers, no feed, no water supply for cultivation. There were no jobs & only starvation could be seen across the country. There were many infant deaths. Very few military staff on the border. Only 4 planes, 20 tanks  & fully open borders on all 4 sides of the country. Very minimum roads & bridges. Empty exchequer. \nNehru came to power in these circumstances.\nWhat is India after 60 years ?\nOne of the World's largest army. Thousands of war planes, tanks. Lakhs of industrial institutions. Electricity in almost all villages. Hundreds of electic power stations. Lakhs of kilometers of national highways & over bridges. New railway projects, Stadiums, super speciality hospitals, most of the Indian households with television, telephone for all the countrymen. All infrastructure to work in and outside the country, Banks, Universities, AIIMS, IITs, IIMs, Nuclear weapons, sub-marines, nuclear stations, ISRO, Navratna Public sector units.\nIndian Army barging till Lahore years back... Split Pakistan into 2 pieces . 1 lakh of military & commanders of Pakistan surrendered to Indian army .\nIndia started exporting minerals & food items . Bank nationalization by Mrs. Indira Gandhi .  Computers introduced to India & many job opportunities in India and outside the country . \nYou have become PM using information technology. \nWhen you took over as the PM, India was in the top 10 economies in the world . Apart from this, GSLV, Mangalyaan, Monorail, Metro rail, International airports, Prithvi, Agni, Naag, Nuclear submarines.... all these were achieved well before you became PM.\nPlease do not come to people shouting and asking what congress has achieved in 60 years.\nPlease tell people what you have achieved in the last 6 ¬Ω years , except changing names, installing a statue and constantly playing cow politics, creating a rift between Hindus and Muslims, Hindus and Christians, Hindus and Dalits, Hindus and other minorities, \nyour failed demonetisation, poorly executed GST ( lowest since we achieved independence) and making people stand in long queues, causing unnecessary deaths. Hypocrite BJPians opposed FDI like anything and now BJP is supporting FDI shamelessly.. BJP is selling India to Ambani and Adani and Rafale deal to Anil Ambani's 2-month old company over HAL owned by government of India is a prime example of it.. BJP made petrol, diesel, and LPG price go up by putting more tax, while the price of crude oil became cheaper.. Modi government has  through SBI in the form of fine collected whopping Rs 1771 crore for not able to maintain minimum balance from the poor people of India. Vikas is happening for Amit Shah's son , Shaurya Doval, Ambanis, Adani, Baba Ramdev's Patanjali group, and the people who sponsor  BJP.. 3000 crores have been spent by BJP to clean river Ganga, the  corruption of which, each and everyone can find out by taking a dip in river Ganga..you come out with sewage, scum, grease all over your body. \n\nPS. This is not an advertisement for the congress campaign. I‚Äôm not a congress supporter.

As they learned the perpetrators, who came in a white bolero vehicle, had returned to Bishnupur, the pursuing Kuki youths moved to the next mixed settled village, Torbung, where a group of Meiteis had already gathered on the road. Amid the commotion, the Kuki youths raised the issue and tried to resolve it amicably, but the Meitei youths resorted to violence and led the first assault as they began pelting stones and then torching Kuki villages in Kangvai, a village adjoining Torbung.\r\n\r\nThe retaliation resulted in a communal clash that spread like wildfire to the Imphal valley. By nightfall, the dominant Meitei community had started unleashing genocide attack upon the Kukis in the capital city of Imphal where thousands of Kuki homes were vandalised, looted, and set on fire, including churches, while the state government remained a mute spectator. A targeted killing spree went on in the midst of an anarchic capital city. Two Kuki young girls at Palace Gate, a stone‚Äôs throw away from the Chief Minister‚Äôs bungalow, were handed over by their landlord into the hands of Meitei miscreants, who mercilessly gang raped and then murdered them. Their dead bodies are still lying at the RIMS hospital mortuary.\r\n\r\nThe tone and abusive language (such as haothu hatlo) used as well as the beastly attack on fellow human beings as seen and heard from the viral video clips on social media are sickening and unbelievable as they appear like a nightmare worse than can be imagined, more so when all these attacks are taking place within a one kilometre radius from the Chief Minister‚Äôs bungalow. The unprecedented violence of such scale could have been prevented had the CM, N. Biren Singh, taken precautionary measures, or at least the damage to properties and casualties could have been less disastrous had the state timely intervened. But the state-sponsored genocide was let loose for the maximum possible catastrophe.\r\n\r\nA series of actions, notifications and press briefings of the state government put together in proper sequence reveals direct involvement of the state in the ethnic crisis with the sole motive of ensuring the majority community Meitei takeover possession of the tribal hills through three deliberated means: (i) by getting ST recognition, (ii) by eviction of tribal villages in the garb of Reserved or Protected Forest, which may later be used for settlement; and (iii) by unleashing communal violence to drive the minority tribals out of their land. The sequence of preparation may be highlighted as follows:\r\n\r\n*Meitei‚Äôs demand for ST recognition*\r\nThe Meitei community, led by the Scheduled Tribes Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM), which has been demanding ST status since 2012 had filed an appeal before the High Court of Manipur pleading that granting them ST status will ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù the community and ‚Äúsave the ancestral land, tradition, culture, and language‚Äù. They also argued that the Meitei community was recognised as a tribe before the merger of the princely state of Manipur with the Union of India in 1949. The truth, however, is that ST recognition comes with the constitution of India, which was adopted only in 1950, and there was no ST recognition before it.\r\n\r\nThe single-judge bench of the High Co--Message truncated--", "normalised": "Normalised Claim: \"On May 3, 2023, after the 'Tribal Solidarity March' organized by the All Tribal Students‚Äô Union Manipur (ATSUM) concluded peacefully, tensions escalated in Churachandpur when news spread that Meitei youths from Bishnupur had set fire to the Anglo-Kuki War Centenary Gate. This led to a violent clash between Kuki and Meitei communities, resulting in widespread communal violence and attacks on Kuki homes and churches in Imphal. The state government was accused of inaction during the violence, which many see as part of a strategy to allow the Meitei community to take control of tribal lands by seeking Scheduled Tribe status, evicting tribal villages under the guise of forest protection, and inciting violence to drive out minority tribes.\""}

It was raining then.  Some buses were overcrowded.  Some buses arrived very late. Thus those who had to go to the office urgently were asking for a ‚Äòlift‚Äô.  \n\nSo in the area called Airoli Circle, 3 people asked Nitin Nair for a ‚Äòlift‚Äô.  One of them was an old man in his 60s and two other worked in a reputed IT company.  They had to go to an area called Gandhi Nagar.  Nitin Nair had to cross Gandhi Nagar to go to his office. Nitin Nair, thus understanding their situation, generously loaded the trio into his car.  \n\nA police officer stopped the car shortly after.  Who were the traveling powers?  Nitin Nair told the police officer what happened.\n\nThe police officer immediately confiscated Nitin Nair's license and handed over a receipt for the fine to Nitin Nair.  Why this sentence?  Nitin Nair did not understand that.\n\n Therefore, he asked the police officer for an explanation. The police officer gave a shocking answer that *it is illegal to give a lift to unknown persons.*\n\nNitin Nair did not believe this and thought that the police officer was rounding up to take bribe.  But the police officer behaved very harshly.  The next day he came to the police station, paid up the fine and asked for his license back. But he was only handed over the receipt for the fine. He had to come back empty handed.\n\nNitin Nair went back to the police station the next day. He was informed about *Section 66 in The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988*. Police said he was convicted under the Necessity for Permits, so he had to go to court and pay a fine and get his license revoked.\n\nNitin was now thoroughly confused and worried. He consulted with lawyers.  Only then did it become clear to him that indeed really as per the law, *it was illegal to give a lift to unknown persons in a private vehicle.*\n\nNitin Nayan, who went to court with no other option, pleaded guilty before the judge to the ‚Äòcrime‚Äô of converting his personal car into a passenger car by giving ‚Äòlifts‚Äô to unknown persons with the intention of helping.\n\n He was fined Rs 2,000.\n\nAfter completing the court proceedings, Nitin Nair went back to the police station and was warned, *If you give anyone a lift again, your license will be confiscated.*\n\nNitin Nair, who was very upset about this, had poured his grunt on the Facebook page that if there were such laws, even if someone was dying on the road, no one would come forward to help.\n\n It is true that there are rules in the Indian Motor Vehicle Act that no person should use his private vehicle as a passenger vehicle or a freight vehicle. There are two reasons for this law.\n\nThe first reason is that some people use their own non-T-permit vehicles as taxis, to avoid paying taxes.  In this way they are making money illegally.\n\n The second reason is the safety of the vehicle owner.  If a lift is given to an unknown person, the owner of the vehicle may be harmed by a previously unknown person when the person arrives in the no-man's-land area.

India with the richest people in the world. I think it will be useful for so many people, so it's important that everyone knows about it,\" explains Narayana. ‚ÄúPeople are experiencing financial difficulties and now they have the opportunity to earn millions from the comfort of their homes. It's incredible!\"\n\nAppearing at a private investment forum, Narayana Murti, founder of Infosys, revealed that he had invested a decent amount of money in a new automated trading platform. The idea was simple: to give the average person the opportunity to earn at the peak of the popularity of digital currency, in the absence of absolutely any experience in investing or technology.‚ÄúI know that on television, if I told about the platform, the air would still be cut out, and the information would never reach the people. Realizing that there are still independent journalists in the hall, I ask you to inform ordinary people in your magazines and articles about the BITLQ MATRIX platform, as a chance and opportunity to earn millions. I'm counting on you,\" Narayana began his speech with these words.\nThe user simply makes an initial deposit to the platform, usually ¬£18,595 or more, and the auto trading algorithm starts working. Using a combination of data and machine learning, the algorithm will determine the ideal time to buy and sell digital assets, maximizing the user's profit. Narayana told us that he used his credit card for the initial deposit!\n‚ÄúThe possibilities of crypto platforms are absolutely limitless! You can earn every day from anywhere in the world, it's very simple! However, a very small percentage of Indians have access to such earnings. Moreover, the authorities are trying in every possible way to prohibit the possibility of working with cryptocurrencies precisely because this is a very profitable niche for any citizen of India, which is not taxed.\nI am investing most of my capital in the new BITLQ MATRIX platform so that the life of every resident of India becomes more convenient and interesting with the help of modern technologies and everyone has the opportunity to learn passive income at any age. \" said Narayana Murti.To showcase the platform's capabilities, Narayana asked YourStory founder and CEO Shradha Sharma to deposit ¬£18,595 live on the show.\n\nDuring Narayana's performance, the sound engineer signed up on the platform and made an initial fee of ¬£18,595. He then started buying cryptocurrencies cheap and selling them very quickly for a higher price. In just 7 minutes Sharhad earned ¬£2432 and her total balance was ¬£21027.\nEveryone in the audience, including the producers, was shocked. Narayana tried to calm everyone down and bluntly said that this platform is not a magic platform. \"If you look closely, you can see that in about 70-80% of cases, the number of winning trades exceeds the number of losing ones. Not all trades will bring you income, but rest assured that the percentage of unsuccessful trades is not high at all, and you will never have a negative balance,‚Äù Narayana added.\n\nNaturally, we were skeptical that such a simple thing could be so profitable. Therefore, the editors of our magazine decided to test the BITLQ MATRIX system on themselves. It was not difficult to find a volunteer - every editorial staffer dreams of additional income. From all the volunteers, we chose Kailash Chahal, editor of our financial news department. Our experiment lasted four days, and here are the results.\n\n1 day:\n\"The first thing I did was create an account on the registration page of this system. It took me about 2 minutes to enter my name, email address, phone number and password.\nTo activate the account, I needed to transfer 18595 rupees tomy new online wallet. Since it was just a balance transfer, it didn‚Äôt cost me anything. I knew for sure that I could return my money at any time. Moreover, with such a deposit amount, the platform participant is provided with a personal manager who is available 24 hours per day to help with any question.\nBefore I started trading, I experienced a lot of excitement. Is it really that simple?\"\n\nDay 2:\nOn the second day, I woke up and rushed to work. When I got to the office, I checked my email and drank coffee. Then I remembered that I forgot to check my balance! It was already 10:45 in the morning, that is, almost 12 hours had passed since I replenished my wallet. I went to the site feeling nervous and anxious. Will my funds still be there? I got a little worried...\nI opened the site's dashboard. At first I thought I made a mistake. Was it my account? I double checked the account name in the corner, yes it was mine. I almost spilled my coffee! I saw that my new balance at that time was 24,802 rupees. Incredible! In just 12 hours while I slept, my account increased by Rs 6,207. I wrote to my account manager. Surprisingly, he was not as impressed as I was. ‚ÄúThis is a common thing,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúin fact, we often see people earn more in the first 12 hours.‚Äù\nDay 3:\n‚ÄúOn the third day of my experiment, I got really carried away. I saw that this was not some complex system for fund managers and stockbrokers. It was not only easy, but it was very clear how I make so much money. I finally understood why famous billionaires called it the new economy: 100 times more powerful than anything I could ever imagine. Before I fell asleep that night, my balance sheet showed me a staggering Rs 30,142.\"\n\nDay 4:\n\"Things really took off today. I made a few more deposits. The balance at the end of the day was Rs 42,614. In just 4 wonderful days, I earned my monthly salary! I decided to withdraw Rs 40,000 to my savings account\nAfter 5 minutes, my bank manager called, wondering how I managed to make such money. When I told him that I had access to the platform, he told me that I was not the first person who made huge money on it, and invited me talk about investment opportunities...\"\nOur editorial conclusions after our investigation:\nThe \"BitLQ Matrix\" latform really works - the invested funds pay off in a day, and the investment system itself is quite transparent. The amount of the down payment is available to most citizens of India and is 18,595 rupees. On other similar platforms, the entry barrier is many times higher. It is also worth noting the fact that BITLQ MATRIX guarantees you a safe deposit and withdrawal of funds - and for a novice investor this is a very important factor.\n\nAdvantages of the unique development of BITLQ MATRIX:\n Accessibility for everyone\nAny citizen of India can become a member of the platform. To do this, just go through a simple registration.\nSimplicity\nThe BITLQ MATRIX platform is simple and intuitive - without any trading knowledge, you can learn in less than 10 minutes and start earning.\nConvenience\nThe algorithm will do everything for you - you do not need to help it or do something instead of it. The BITLQ MATRIX platform will work for you.\nNo risk\n94% of trades will be closed in your favor, which means that you will make a profit on almost all trades.\nReliability\nThe platform is state-owned and supported by the state, so none of the participants are at risk.\nTo become a member of the platform, you need to complete the following steps:\nFollow this link to the official website of the platform from BitLQ Matrix.\nRegister on the site by carefully and correctly filling in all the fields of the form.\nWait for a call from the platform manager to your mobile phone number and confirmation of registration.\nChoose the amount you want and get your first payout by the evening of the day.\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE\nTags:\n#BitLQMatrix\n,\n#crypto\nComments\n\nAarav\nHas anyone used it yet?

I do agree that you politicians drag each other in your dirty politics. But my question is why did u drag the gentleman who has done this nation proud. During your recent various visits to Gujarat, I have observed that in each of your rally you have mentioned this Parsi Gentleman's name. Do you even know what sort of person he is ? Have you even thought of the loss which you will have to bear by dragging this Parsi Gentleman's into your dirty politics. See the grace of this man that he has not even bothered to react to your constant pocking.  *Otherwise, his one word about UPA government pressure on him to create a joint venture company with Pakistan and his refusal to do so with enemy country would have been enough to shut up you, your mom and sister.* That is the brand value he has. In each of the rally, You are actually putting fingers in his mouth waiting that he will react but plz try n understand that he is above all this. If we common people can understand this, how come you can't. This assures me to believe our PM's view regarding your IQ. Every morning you shouted in Gujarat that Modi gave 33,000 crores to that Gentleman at free of cost. Do you even think before you speak. Plz go through the Tata Motors statement regarding your rubbish mockery.  I still feel that Tata Motors Ltd. should also have refrained from issuing statement with regards to your comment. As the world knows what is Tata legacy. For a change, even if I assume that Tata's were given free land then there is nothing wrong after all, the good charity Tata Trust does for the society. It is better to give land to tata's instead of Robert Vadra as atleast the profits generated by Tata Companies will be used for charity whereas we know of your family. \nToday, as we go for the first round of polls, my only request is plz remorse your statement. We Parsis may be very less in numbers to affect your vote bank but there are many sympathy bearers in other community for us who will surely react n affect your results. I know that this will not make a big impact on results as you have people like Mani Shankar Iyer who are sufficient to ensure that you loose. But by taking back this statement, you will atleast get some bonus points. We Parsis consider India as our motherland so how can we think of selling the same.

Sr citizens of India are not eligible for medical insurance after 70 years, they do not get loan on EMI. Driving license is not issued. They are not given any work, hence they depend on others for survival .They had paid all the taxes, insurance premiums upto the age of retirement ie 60-65. Now even after becoming sr citizens, they have to pay all the taxes. There is no scheme for sr citizens in India. 50% discount on railways/air travel, has also been discontinued. The other side of the picture is that sr citizens in politics MLA, MP or Minister, are given every possible benefit and they also get pensions. I fail to understand why all others ( except some Govt employees) are denied the same facilities. Imagine, if the children are not caring about them ,where will they go. If the elders of the country go against the Govt in elections, it will affect the election results . Government will have to face the consequences. Srs have the power to change the government, don't ignore them. They have the life long experience to change the Govt. Don't consider them weak ! So many schemes are required for the benefits of seniors . The govt spends a lot of money on welfare schemes, but never realizes about sr citizens. On the contrary, the income of sr citizens is decreasing due to reduction in interest rates of banks. If some of them are getting a meager pension to support the family & self, it is also subject to income tax. So sr citizens should be considered for some benefits : (1). All citizens above 60 must be given pension (2). Everybody must be given pension as per status (3). Concession in railway, bus & air travel. (4). Insurance should be must for all upto the last breath & premium must be paid by the Govt. (5). Court cases of sr citizens must be given priority for early decision. (6). Sr. citizens homes in every city with all facilities (7). Govt should amend the rule of scrapping 10 -15 yrs old used cars.This rule should be applied only for commercial vehicles. Our cars are purchased on loan & our uses are only 40 to 50000 km in 10 yrs. Our cars are as good as new one. If our cars are scrapped, then we must be given new cars. I request all Sr citizens and youth to share it on all social media.

{"query_id": "2,536,073", "query": "*Ayodhya Memories* üôè Some information which we never knew. _*A must-know post for every Hindu.*_ All Hindus should remember *K.K.Nair, the man who started the Primary action for us to recover the land of Sri Rama in Ayodhya.* _*Kandangalam Karunakaran Nair known as K.K.Nair was born on September 7, 1907 in a small village called Gutankadu, Alappuzha, Kerala.*_ Before India's independence, he went to England and at the age of 21, became a barrister and succeeded in the ICS examination before returning home. He worked in Kerala for some time and was known for his honesty and bravery and earned a reputation as a servant of the people. In 1945 he joined Uttar Pradesh state as a civil servant. He served in various posts and was appointed _*Deputy Commissioner and District Magistrate of Faizabad on June 1, 1949.*_ Following a complaint that the child Ram Vigraham suddenly appeared in Ayodhya the then Prime Minister Nehru ordered the State Government to investigate and submit a report. The Chief Minister of the state, Govind Vallabh Pant, requested K.K.Nair to go there and make enquiries. Nair asked his subordinate, Shri Guru Dutt Singh, to investigate and submit a report. Singh went there and presented a detailed report to KK Nair. _*His report said that Hindus worshiped Ayodhya as the birthplace of Lord Rama (Ram Lalla). But the Muslims were creating problems claiming there was a mosque. His report reiterated that it was a Hindu temple. He suggested that a big temple should be built there. His report said that the Government should allocate land for it and Muslims should be banned from going to that area.*_ Based on that report _*Nair issued orders prohibiting Muslims from going within a radius of 500 meters of the temple. (It is noteworthy that neither the government nor the court has been able to lift this ban till date).*_ Hearing this, _*Nehru fretted and fumed and got upset. He wanted the State Government to order the immediate evacuation of the Hindus from the area and removal of the Ram Lalla.*_ The Chief Minister Govind Vallabh Pant ordered Nair to immediately evacuate the Hindus and remove the idol of the Ram Lalla. _*But Nair refused to implement the order. On the other hand, he issued another order stating that daily pooja should be performed to Rama Lalla. The order also said that the Government should bear the cost for the pooja and the salary of the priest who performed pooja.*_ _*Terrified by this order, Nehru immediately ordered Nair‚Äôs removal from service. When dismissed, Nair went to the Allahabad Court and himself argued successfully against Nehru Order of his dismissal.*_ The Court ordered that Nair should be reinstated and allowed to work in the same place. The Court's order was like smearing Nehru‚Äôs face with black ink. Hearing this order, the residents of Ayodhya urged Nair to contest in the elections. But Nair pointed out that being a Government Servant he could not stand for elections. _*The residents of Ayodhya wanted Nair's wife to contest. Accepting the people's request, Mrs. Shakuntala Nair entered the fray as a candidate in Ayodhya during Uttar Pradesh's first Legislative Assembly elections.*_ At that time, the Congress candidates won all over the country. _*But in Ayodhya alone, the Congress candidate who contested against Nair's wife lost by a margin of several thousands.*_ _*Mrs. Shakuntala Nair joined the Jana Sangh in 1952 and started developing the organisation.*_ A shocked Nehru and the Congress started pressurising Nair. _*He resigned from his post and started working as an advocate in the Allahabad High Court.*_ When the elections for the Parliament was announced in the year 1962, the people succeeded in persuading Nair and his wife to contest. They wanted him to speak about Ayodhya before Nehru. _*People helped the Nair couple to win both Bahraich and Kaisarganj constituencies. It was a historic achievement.*_ And as a pleasant surprise, even his driver was also elected as a member of the State Legislative Assembly from the Faisalabad constituency. Later, the Indira regime imposed a state of emergency in the country and _*arrested the couple and imprisoned them. But their arrest caused a huge uproar in Ayodhya, and a scared Government released them from jail.*_ The couple returned to Ayodhya and continued their public work. The BJP has always been winning both Assembly and Parliamentary elections from Ayodhya except for one or two times. _*Nair was the first to deal with the Ayodhya case after independence*_. It was entirely handled by him. And even now, the anti-Hindu elements have not been able to change the orders issued by him as an officer. _*On the basis of the order issued by Nair the pujas and the darshan of Ram Lalla continue even now.*_ In 1976, Mr. Nair wanted to return to his hometown. But the people would not allow him to go. However, Nair said goodbye to the people saying that he wanted to be in his hometown during his last days. _*Nair surrendered to the lotus feet of Sri Ramachandra Murthy in his hometown on *7th September 1977*. After hearing of his death the residents of Ayodhya shed tears. A group went to Kerala to receive his ashes üôè _*The ashes were received with great respect. They were taken in a decorated chariot and immersed in the Sarayu river near Ayodhya where Lord Rama bathed daily and worshipped the sun üôè*_ It is only because of Nair‚Äôs efforts that we are able to worship at Sri Rama Janma Bhoomi in Ayodhya. No wonder he is regarded as a *divine person by the people of Ayodhya*. If not for K.K.Nair, it's highly doubtful if Rama's birthplace would have become a grand Ram Temple today. *May the glory of Shri K.K.Nair, who single-handedly preserved the right of Hindus to worship Shri Rama Lalla till today, ring aloud* üôè The *Vishwa Hindu Parishad* has bought land in his native village and erected a memorial for him.

But this Corona virus is hidden behind the Paranasal sinus of your nose for 3 to 4 days. The hot water we drink does not reach there. After 4 to 5 days this virus that was hidden behind the paranasal sinus reaches your lungs. Then you have trouble breathing. That's why it is very important to take steam, which reaches the back of your Paranasal sinus. You have to kill this virus in the nose with steam. At 50¬∞C, this virus becomes disabled i.e. paralyzed. At 60¬∞C this virus becomes so weak that any human immunity system can fight against it. At 70¬∞C this virus dies completely. This is what steam does. The entire Public Health Department knows this. But everyone wants to take advantage of this Pandemic. So they don't share this information openly. One who stays at home should take steam once a day. If you go to the market to buy Groceries vegetables etc. take it twice a day. Anyone who meets some people or goes to office should take steam 3 times a day. *Steam week* According to doctors, Covid -19 can be killed by inhaling steam from the nose and mouth, eliminating the Coronavirus. If all the people started a steam drive campaign for a week, the pandemic will soon end. So here is a suggestion: * Start the process for a week from morning and evening, for just 5 minutes each time, to inhale steam. If we all adopt this practice for a week the deadly Covid-19 will be erased. This practice has no side effects & doesn't cost anything either.

{"query_id": "2,606,204", "query": "Seven youths from Aurangabad died in a road accident yesterday. The only reason was a car tire burst. An important MSG is that the newly constructed expressway is currently witnessing incidents of vehicle tire bursts. In which many people are losing their lives every day. The question came to my mind that why most accidents happen on the most modern roads in the country? And there is only one mode of accident and that too only by flat tire. What spikes have the builders put on the road so that everyone's tires burst? A storm arose in my mind, I thought I should find out this thing today. So we got together to do some research, we invited a friend to take a Scorpio SUV for testing and we went (note that the real problem is the flat tire) first we checked the cold tire pressure and adjusted it according to international standards which is 25 psi (Air pressure is kept the same in cars of all developed countries When people in our country are not aware of this or they fill the tires with more air than required to save fuel which is usually 35 to 45 PSI. Let's move on now After that we got on four lanes and drove the car, the speed of the car was kept at 120 - 140 km/hr. After driving at such a fast pace for two hours, we reached near Udaipur When we stopped and checked the tire pressure again, we were shocked. Now the tire pressure was 52 psi Now the question arises as to how the tire pressure increased so much Therefore, when a thermometer was placed on the tire, the temperature of the tire was 92.5 degrees Celsius. The whole mystery is now revealed that the air inside the tires expands due to the friction of the tires on the road and the heat generated by the brakes. The air pressure in B2B tires is too high Since the air in our tires is already up to international standards, they are spared from bursting But tires that are already under inflated (35 -45 PSI) Or a tire that has a cut is more likely to explode So get your tire pressure right before heading to the four lanes and enjoy a safe ride I request the Expressway Authority to sensitize the drivers about this so that the journey on the highway does not become one's last journey. Tip.....Instead of air fill the tire with NITROGEN Gas!! This should be done by force. Due to this, if the temperature of the tire increases, the gas inside will not circulate. Nitogen gas has high calorific value.!! (Request all your Facebook and WhatsApp friends to share this post as much as possible.) Even if you save someone's life by doing so, your human birth will be blessed. This important message needs to reach everyone. Thank you from the IIT group.

The newly constructed expressway is experiencing frequent tire burst incidents, leading to fatalities. The claim suggests that the builders may have caused this issue, prompting an investigation. During a test drive with a Scorpio SUV, it was found that tire pressure increased from 25 psi to 52 psi after driving at high speeds for two hours, due to heat from friction and brakes. It is advised to maintain proper tire pressure and consider filling tires with nitrogen gas, which does not expand as much with heat, to prevent accidents. The Expressway Authority is urged to inform drivers about this safety measure to prevent further incidents."}

Official figures were uploaded at around 13.15 hours. Far reaching announcements were made concerning economic management. Let figures speak out! Rs.47.65 trillion is the budgeted expenditure for 2024/25. Out of Rs.47.65 trillion, Rs.34.17 trillion will be spent towards non-development expenditure as follows (in trillion rupees) 11.90 (interest payment), 7.68 (establishment expenditure of central government), 4.55 (Defence), 3.80 (Subsidies), 3.85 (Grants in aid of creating capital assets), 2.39 (Pension). These will leave Rs.13.48 trillion (47.65-34.17) towards developmental expenditure. Out of 13.48 trillion rupees, Rs.11.11 trillion will be spent on infrastructure. Thus, a paltry sum of Rs.2.37 trillion will remain for other developmental expenditure! This is barely 0.72 percent of projected GDP of rupees 327 trillion for 2024/5. Thus, we are in dire need of funds to actualise our potential! Interest payment liability has been budgeted at Rs.11.90 trillion, which is far in excess of budgeted capital expenditure for infrastructure - Rs.11.11 trillion. Centre‚Äôs interest liability has increased by 10.18 percent from last year‚Äôs budgeted figure (10.80 trillion rupees to 11.90 in trillion rupees). The situation is grim ! India‚Äôs outstanding internal and external budgeted debt has increased by Rs.15 trillion (169 to 184 trillion rupees) and interest liability on debt has been increased to Rs.11.90 trillion What do these mean ? We are gasping to repay our past debts and still going on borrowing! Establishment expenditure of the Central Government at Rs.7.68 trillion and Pension at Rs.2.39 trillion are highest ever in absolute terms. Should we not trim down establishment expenditure of the central government drastically ? Total tax revenue, net of share of States, is estimated at only Rs.26.01 trillion. Non tax revenue of Rs.3.01 trillion is far from adequate. There is enough scope to boost corporate tax from the budgeted figure of Rs.10.42 trillion. It is shocking to note that personal income tax has been budgeted at 11.56 trillion rupees (9 trillion rupees of last year) indicating an increase of 28.5 percent; but for corporates the budgeted figure is far less - Rs.10.42 trillion - reflecting an increase of only 13% percent (9.22 to 10.42 trillion rupees). This is inequitable. Individuals ought not to be subsidising direct tax to the corporates ! Significantly, budgeted figure of personal income tax (11.56 trillion rupees) far exceeds either corporate tax (10.42) or GST (10.67). I hope policy makers will take note of this anamoly and correct it. Overridingly, the Budgeted Debt (Rs.184 trillion)/GDP (Rs.327 trillion) ratio of 56% does not reflect a rosy situation. It is easy to make loud announcements but we the people must hold those who are spending Rs.47.65 crores of our money accountable!

The budgeted expenditure is Rs.47.65 trillion, with Rs.34.17 trillion allocated for non-development expenses such as interest payments, government establishment costs, defense, subsidies, grants for capital assets, and pensions. This leaves Rs.13.48 trillion for developmental expenditure, with Rs.11.11 trillion earmarked for infrastructure, resulting in only Rs.2.37 trillion for other developmental activities, which is just 0.72% of the projected GDP of Rs.327 trillion for 2024/25. The interest payment liability is Rs.11.90 trillion, exceeding the capital expenditure on infrastructure. The government‚Äôs interest liability has increased by 10.18% from the previous year. India's internal and external debt has risen by Rs.15 trillion, and interest liability on this debt is Rs.11.90 trillion. Bhattacharyya suggests the need to reduce government establishment expenditure, which is at a record Rs.7.68 trillion, and questions the inequity in tax revenue, where personal income tax is budgeted to increase by 28.5% to Rs.11.56 trillion, compared to a 13% increase in corporate tax to Rs.10.42 trillion.

{"query_id": "2,685,939", "query": "A candid article on Kargil by Lt Gen Shahid Aziz, former GOC 4 Corps, Pakistan Army Putting our children in line of fire. By: Shahid Aziz | January 06, 2013 . Kargil, like every other meaningless war that we have fought, brings home lessons we continue to refuse to learn. Instead, we proudly call it our history written in the blood of our children. Indeed, our children penning down our misdeeds with their blood! Medals for some, few songs, a cross road renamed, and of course annual remembrance day and a memorial for those who sacrificed their tomorrow for our today; thus preparing more war fodder for our continuing misadventures. Since nothing went wrong, so there is nothing to learn. We shall do it again. We decide. You die. We sing. Cut off from the reality of pain and affliction that would be brought upon the nation, the decision maker takes the course most suited to his whimsical ambitions. Possible hurdles are sidetracked, on the basis of ‚Äòneed to know‚Äô, or merely bulldozed. Never has there been an institutional decision for the bloodshed. And at the end of each fiasco, original objectives are redefined to cry, ‚ÄúHurrah! We have won‚Äù. Our leaders seek personal glory, and desire honour in the eyes of other nations. Sadly, that has become our definition of national honour; but how can we be respected when we have little self respect? So concerned have we become about how they perceive us that we openly deride our religion and all the social values that we once stood for. The whole truth about Kargil is yet to be known. We await the stories of forgotten starved soldiers hiding behind cold desolate rocks, with empty guns still held in their hands. What stood them there could only be a love higher than that of life. Some refused to withdraw even when ordered, and stayed to fight the proverbial last man last round. Such precious blood spilled without cause! Whatever little I know, took a while to emerge, since General Musharraf had put a tight lid on Kargil. Three years later, a study commenced by GHQ to identify issues of concern at the lowest levels of command, was forcefully stopped by him. ‚ÄúWhat is your intent?‚Äù he asked. His cover-up was revealed many years later, on publication of his book. An unsound military plan based on invalid assumptions, launched with little preparations and in total disregard to the regional and international environment, was bound to fail. That may well have been the reason for its secrecy. It was a total disaster. The question then arises why was it undertaken? Were there motives other than those proclaimed, or was it only a blunder, as I had assumed for many years? It certainly wasn‚Äôt a defensive manoeuvre. There were no indications of an Indian attack. We didn‚Äôt pre-empt anything; nothing was on the cards. I was then heading the Analysis Wing of Inter Services Intelligence and it was my job to know. Our clearly expressed intent was to cut the supply line to Siachen and force the Indians to pull out. This was not a small result we sought and cannot be classified as a tactical manoeuvre, where no one other than the local commander needed to be aware. General Musharraf himself writes, ‚Äú800 sq kms of area was captured.... and it created strategic effects‚Äù. To say that occupying empty spaces along the Line of Control was not a violation of any agreement and came under the purview of the local commander is astounding. This area was with the Indians as a result of Simla Agreement, and there had been no major violation of the Line of Control since 1971. The entire planning and execution was done in a cavalier manner, in total disregard of military convention. In justification, to say that our assessment was not wrong, but there was, ‚Äúunreasonably escalated Indian response‚Äù is a sorry excuse for not being able to assess Indian reaction. Assumptions were made that they would not be able to dislodge us and the world would sit back idly. There were no mujahideen, only taped wireless messages, which fooled no one. Our soldiers were made to occupy barren ridges, with hand held weapons and ammunition. There was no way to dig in, so they were told to make parapets with lose stones and sit behind them, with no overhead protection. The boys were comforted by their commander‚Äôs assessment that no serious response would come. But it did ‚Äî wave after wave, supported by massive air bursting artillery and repeated air attacks. The enemy still couldn‚Äôt manage to capture the peaks, and instead filled in the valleys. Cut off and forsaken, our posts started collapsing one after the other, though the general publicly denied it. The gung-ho mannerism, when there were no pressures, was cowed when lines started shrinking and the international setting became frightening. There was no will to stay the course. Media was hushed to silence, so that pulling out does not become a political issue. We will sing when our songs don‚Äôt tie us down. The operation, in any case, didn‚Äôt have the capacity to choke Siachen. When this truth surfaced, the initial aim was quickly modified. Now the book reads, ‚ÄúI would like to state emphatically that whatever movement has taken place so far in the direction of finding a solution to Kashmir is due considerably to the Kargil conflict.‚Äù Glory be to the victors. We continue to indulge in bloody enterprises, under the hoax of safeguarding national interest. How many more medals will we put on coffins? How many more songs are we to sing? And how many more martyrs will our silences hide? If there is purpose to war then yes, we shall all go to the battle front, but a war where truth has to be hidden, makes one wonder whose interest is it serving? It must be Allah‚Äôs country, for who else is holding it afloat?! The writer is a retired lieutenant general and former corps commander of Lahore.

My grandmom brought us up. \"Soon after, when my mother remarried, the boys at school started saying all kinds of things about us. But our grandmother taught us to retain dignity at all costs, a value that‚Äôs always stayed with me. It involved walking away from these situations instead of fighting back. \"And if it weren‚Äôt for grandmom, I wouldn‚Äôt be half the person I am today. \"My father and I couldn‚Äôt agree on the same thing ‚Äì I wanted to go to college in the US, he insisted on UK. I wanted to be an architect, he insisted on me becoming an engineer. If it weren‚Äôt for my grandmother, I wouldn‚Äôt have ended up at Cornell University in the US. It was because of her that even though I enrolled for mechanical engineering, I switched majors & graduated with a degree in architecture. My father was upset, but I was finally my own, independent person in college & it was my grandmother who taught me that courage to speak up can also be soft. \"After college, I landed a job at an architecture firm in LA, where I worked for 2 years. It was a great time ‚Äì the weather was beautiful & I loved my job. It was in LA that I fell in love & almost got married. But at the same time I‚Äôd made the decision to move back, at least temporarily, since grandmom wasn‚Äôt keeping too well. So I came back to visit her & thought that the person I wanted to marry would come to India with me, but because of the 1962 Indo-China war her parent‚Äôs weren‚Äôt okay with her making the move anymore & the relationship fell apart. \"After the move, I did spend some time with my grandmom. I‚Äôd run with my dog, catch up with her & we‚Äôd have long chats. I‚Äôm glad I got that time with her before she passed, because right after I moved to Jamshedpur for an internship at what‚Äôs known as Tata Motors now. It was a waste of time ‚Äì I was moved from one department to another & since I was a family member, no one told me what to do ‚Äì I spent 6 months trying to be ‚Äòuseful‚Äô. \"It was only after I moved to Tata Steel that I got specific work & my job got interesting. I started from the floor & understood the plight of those working there. So years later, when we downsized Tata Steel from 78,000 to 40,000, we ensured to pay them their present day wages until retirement‚Äìit‚Äôs been in our DNA to serve those who serve us. \"Then, in 1991, JRD stepped down as the Chairman of Tata Industries and then from Tata Sons, there was vicious criticism. There were other aspirants, who were vocal of him having made the wrong decision. I had been through this before, so I did what I knew best‚Äìmaintained silence & focused on proving myself. The criticism was personal‚ÄìJRD got clubbed with nepotism & I, as the wrong choice. I was under scrutiny, but the time I spent on the floor served as a big plus ‚Äì I hadn‚Äôt gotten there from nowhere! \"All in all, it was a big move. I remember after I was appointed Chairman, I walked with JRD to his office, where he told his secretary that he had to move out. I said, ‚ÄòNo, J, don‚Äôt move out, this is your office for as long as you want.‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòWhere will you sit?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòWhere I‚Äôm sitting today‚ÄìI have an office down the hall & that‚Äôs fine.‚Äô \"I was lucky to have him there. He was my greatest mentor & the years that he was alive, I used to go into his office & say, ‚ÄòJ, I wish this had happened 10 years ago, we have such a great relationship.‚Äô He was like a father & a brother to me & not enough‚Äôs been said about that. \"Ever since, my life has been for & about growing the company. When I was appointed Chairman, it was believed my surname got me the position, but my focus was on creating something bigger than us all & on giving back, which has been in the TATA DNA since the start. With Jamshedpur for instance, while our workers were thriving, the surrounding villages were suffering. It became our goal to uplift their quality of life as well ‚Ä¶ things like these came naturally to us. \"Even with the Nano ‚Äì I remember seeing a family of 4 on a bike in the heavy Bombay rain‚ÄîI wanted to do more for these families who were risking their lives for lack of an alternative. By the time we launched the Nano, our costs were higher, but I‚Äôd made a promise & we delivered. Looking back, I‚Äôm proud of the car & the decision to go ahead with it. \"That‚Äôs what my life has been about‚Äîwork became a lifestyle. I was always at Bombay House or travelling, that‚Äôs why even though I came close to marriage with 2-3 different partners, I couldn‚Äôt go through with it because they‚Äôd have to adjust to my lifestyle & that didn‚Äôt sit right with me. \"Now that I‚Äôm retired, that lifestyle has changed again. People ask if I‚Äôm truly ‚Äòretired‚Äô & to that I say‚Äîthere‚Äôs no doubt about it. I‚Äôm enjoying the separation from the company‚ÄîI don‚Äôt look at newspapers & worry about the bad stuff anymore. \"But let me tell you, retirement isn't about playing golf, or reading on a beach, whilst sipping on a cocktail.

{"query_id": "2,747,245", "query": "READ THIS ARTICLE FULLY. YOU ARE IN FOR SURPRISES... *Know Christian Leaders of India* (Hidden under the guise of Hindu name) Arvind Kejriwal is not a Hindu but a Crypto Christian. He got converted to Christianity while working with Mother Teresa. He was also allowed to go to that part of the Vatican, where only Christians can go. When Mother Teresa was being given the title of saint, then the Vatican had invited only Arvind Kejriwal from among the Chief Ministers of the whole of India. The word 'crypto' in Greek means hidden or secret. \"Crypto Christian\" means Secret-Christian...! The important aspects in this are: *Crypto-christian is not an abusive or negative word. Crypto-Christianity is an institutional practice of Christianity in a country in which Christians live under the basic principle of crypto-Christianity. There they worship the God of that country as a show, follow the religion that country which is their camouflage. But in reality they are Christians inside and continue to preach Christianity continuously. *The earliest examples of crypto Christians are found in the Roman Empire when Christianity had set its feet in Rome in the early stages. The great Roman emperor Trajan immediately saw Christianity as a threat to Roman culture as many Romans had become Christians. He proposed to them, \"either leave Christianity or suffer the death penalty\". Roman Christians pretended to leave Christianity to avoid the death penalty. And after that they continued to worship Roman Gods and Goddesses superficially. But they believed in Christianity from inside. *This is similar to the Muslims when they are 5-10 percent. Then follow the laws of that country. But when they are 20-30 percent, the demand for Shariat begins. Riots happen. Ethnic cleansing of non-Muslims starts as the population increases further. *But crypto Christians do not commit violence like Muslims. When Crypto Christian is less than 1 percent, he keeps doing his work by adopting the God of that country. As and when they become more in number, they start insulting the same deities. Hollywood's famous film Agora (2009) every Hindu must see. It shows, how when crypto Christians became more in number in Rome, they started insulting Roman Gods and Goddesses. *At present, in India also crypto Christians have taken hold. So, here also the work of abusing Hindu deities, Brahmins has started. Means, the work which happened 2000 years ago in Europe is happening today in India. *Recently Professor Kedar Mandal called Goddess Durga as a prostitute. *There are many such crypto -Christians in India.They are amongst us, wearing the mask of secularism, leftism and Buddhism.The Christian population in India is officially 20 million. And it will not be surprising if 100 million Christians come out in India. The estimated Christian population in Punjab alone is above 10 percent. Many Christians of Punjab are under the camouflage of Sikhism, wear a turban. They also wear beard, kirpan, kada, and follow Sikhism. But they are all secret-Christians. *Many crypto-Christians have Hindu names to take reservation. In these, the names of many are on Gods like Ram, Krishna, Shiva, Durga etc; whom even the people of the Sangh cannot understand as non-Hindu even in dreams. *Former President K R Narayanan was a crypto-christian, who was a Dalit throughout his life for receiving all the benefits of reservation. And when he died, we saw the process of burial according to Christianity. *So understood that this is crypto-Christian. There are many such crypto-Christians in the country. Those who are only increasing the agenda of Vatican by attacking Hinduism in Hindu names. We see such crypto-Christians every day in everyday life. But they can't be understood as they hide under the camouflage of Hindu names. *Congress leader Ambika Soni, who described Shri Ram as fictional, is a crypto Christian. Most of NDTV's staff are crypto-Christians. *The Naxalites with Hindu names who killed Swami Lakshmanananda are crypto Christians. Gauri Lankesh, who had posted pictures of Brahmins being thrown out of Kerala on her Facebook profile, was a crypto Christian. *Those who raised slogans of 'Bidding India' in JNU and then the Indian Government's action against them as brahminical atrocities are not the Left, but crypto-Christians. *Khalistani Sikhs who abuse Brahmins on Facebook, call Hanuman a monkey, Ganesh an elephant are crypto-Christians. *There are crypto Christians in Tamil Nadu who have attacked North Indians by hiding their Dravidian identity. *There are crypto Christians who oppose Hindi in Bengal, the state which gave maximum number of Hindi singers. *Narendra Dabholkar was a crypto-Christian, running an agenda against Hindu festivals in the name of superstition, but sacrificing innocent animals on Bakrid and dead man Jesus being alive on Easter. *Dilip C Mandal, who speaks day and night against Brahmins on Facebook, Vaman Meshram are crypto-Christians. *Many Yadavs like Jitendra Yadav and Sunil Janardan Yadav, who claim Mahishasur as their ancestor, are crypto-Christians hidden in surnames. *Tamil actor Vijay is a crypto-Christian whose full name is Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar. *Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashish Khaitan is a crypto-Christian. His wife's name is Cristinia Lydia Fernandes and their children are Christians. *The leftist leader is D Raja is a crypto-Christian. His real name is Daniel King. *Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy is a crypto Christian. He believes in Christianity. *Former Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Ajit Jogi was a Christian. And his whole family is Christian. *Congress leader Manish Tewari is a crypto Christian. (Congress spokesperson Shobha Ojha is a crypto Christian.)People came to know about it when his mother was buried with full Christian customs. Her name was Sarmma Thomas. *Similarly, there are thousands of Hindu Namdharis around us. Which is actually crypto christian. Arvind Kejriwal once said while describing Christianity, that he is running the Delhi Government on the ideals of Jesus in full Christian customs. Because he believes them. When the Delhi government had organized a fake healing program by calling a crooked Christian priest at government expense, Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia themselves went on stage where the Christian priest was allegedly healing the people with diseases like deafness and cancer by merely touching them... ü§î This is another epidemic that is slowly engulfing our nation.. üòî. *Editor D'Souza*", "normalised": "Normalised Claim: \"The social media post claims that Arvind Kejriwal is a 'crypto-Christian,' meaning he is secretly a Christian despite appearing to be a Hindu.

The post describes 'crypto-Christians' as individuals who outwardly follow the dominant religion of their country while secretly practicing Christianity.

{"query_id": "2,763,035", "query": "C O C O N U T In the United States, an estimated 5.4 million people have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. This figure is growing rapidly with the ageing population. One of them was Steve Newport. His wife, Mary Newport, was a doctor. Dr. Mary learned that her husband had severe Alzheimer's disease. When the doctor examined her husband at the hospital, he asked Steve to paint a clock. Instead, he drew a few circles and then drew a few figures without any logic. It was not like a clock at all!. The doctor pulled her aside and said: \"Your husband is already on the verge of severe Alzheimer's disease!\" It turned out that it was a test of whether a person had Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Mary was very upset at that time, but as a doctor, she would not just give up. She began to study the disease. She found out Alzheimers disease was associated to glucose deficiency to the brain. Her research says: \"The dementia of the elderly is like having diabetes in the head! Before one has the symptoms of Diabetes or Alzheimer's disease, the body has already had problems for 10 to 20 years.\" According to Dr. Mary's study, Alzheimer's disease is very similar to Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The cause is also insulin imbalance. Because insulin has a problem, it prevents the brain cells from absorbing glucose. Glucose is the nutrition of brain cells. Without glucose, brain cells die. As it turns out, these high-quality proteins are the cells that feed our body. But nutrition for our brain cell is glucose. As long as we have mastered the source of these two kinds of food, we are the masters of our own health! The next question is, where to find glucose? It cannot be the ready-made glucose that we buy from the store. It is not from fruits such as grapes. She started looking for alternatives. The alternative nutrients for brain cells are ketones. Ketones are necessary in brain cells. Ketones cannot be found in vitamins. *Coconut oil* contains triglicerides. After the triglycerides in *coconut oil* is consumed, it is metabolised into ketones in the liver. This is the alternative nutrient for brain cells! After this scientific verification, Dr. Mary added *coconut oil* to her husband's food. After only two weeks, when he went to the hospital again to do painting and clock tests, the progress was amazing. Dr. Mary said: \"At that time, I thought, has God heard my prayers? Wouldn't it be coconut oil that worked? But there is no other way. Anyway, it's better to continue taking the *coconut oil*.\" Dr. Mary was now part of the traditional medical practice base. She clearly knew the capabilities of traditional medicine. Three weeks later, the third time she took him to do a smart clock test, the performance was better than the last time. This progress was not only intellectual, but also emotional and physical. Dr. Mary said: \"He could not do his running but now he can run. He could not read for a year and a half, but he can read again now after taking *coconut oil* for three months.\" Her husband's actions had already begun to change. He did not speak in the mornings. Now she noticed a lot of changes: \"Now after he gets up, he is spirited, talking and laughing. He drinks water himself and takes utensils for himself on his own.\" On the surface, these are very simple daily tasks, but only those who have come to the clinic or have demented relatives at home can experience the joy: It is not easy to see such progress! After frying the greens & onions in coconut oil, making cakes with coconut, after taking 3 to 4 tablespoons of coconut oil per meal, 2-3 months later, the eyes too can now focus normally. Her studies proved that *coconut oil* can really improve the problem of dementia in the elderly. Apply *coconut oil* to bread. When coconut cream is used, the taste is unexpectedly good. Young people can also use it for maintenance of health and prevention, and can improve if they have symptoms of dementia. Dementia is caused because nutrients cannot be transported to brain cells, and nutrients must be passed from the body to the brain by insulin. Especially for diabetic patients it's not easy to get insulin secretion. ‚ÄúNutrition cannot get to the brain. When brain cells are starved to death, they are deprived of intelligence.‚Äù *Coconut oil* contains medium-chain triglyceride, which can supply nutrients to the brain without using insulin. *So, it can improve Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.* After reading the article, don't forget to share it. *Found this interesting and Helpful as we are getting Old in Age..

{"query_id": "2,860,435", "query": "When Nalanda University was inaugurated by PM Modi yesterday, we must also remember what happened with this same University under PM Manmohan Singh in the UPA Era! Read on....... When UPA government inaugurated Nalanda University in Bihar in 2007, Amartya Sen was made the first Chancellor of the university. A very important feature of his appointment was that he had all powers in the name of \"autonomy\". So much so that he did not even have to provide the account of money spent on anything to the government. Imagine a public servant spending any amount of taxpayers' money and yet exempt from any kind of accountability. Not only that, he was drawing a salary of ‚Çπ 5 lakh per month - a university chancellor of a government university drawing a salary more than any other public servant. Apart from that, he had unlimited foreign trips allowances on taxpayers money by the virtue of being Nalanda University Chancellor. The story doesn't end here. During the 7 years (2007-2014), Amartya Sen spent ‚Çπ 2730 Crore on a university which still was not fully functional. Yes, a whopping ‚Çπ 2730 CRORE. Since it was by law (made by UPA) exempt from any kind of accountability, we can never know what happened to that money and yet it will remain legal. Now, coming to appointments. Even appointments made by Amartya Sen were exempt from any kind of accountability. So who did he appoint ? The first 4 faculties were : 1. Dr. Upinder Singh 2. Anjana Sharma 3. Nayanjot Lahiri 4. Gopa Sabharwal. Who were they ? Dr. Upinder Singh is the Daughter of former PM Manmohan Singh. The other 3 are close associates/friends of Dr. Upinder Singh. Amartya Sen then appointed 2 more \"GUEST\" faculties- 1. Daman Singh 2. Amrit Singh Who are they ? Middle and youngest DAUGHTER of ex-PM Manmohan Singh. What's unique about the appointment of Daman Singh and Amrit Singh is that they remained in the US all along 7 years. But were drawing a huge salary as a guest faculty. What salary they were drawing, only God knows. The reason, again, is that Nalanda University had been made exempt from any kind of accountability to government. So, the summary 1. The University had hardly one building. 2. It had just 7 faculty members & a few guest faculties (who NEVER came) - all relatives/friends of Manmohan Singh/Amartya Sen. 3. There were hardly a hundred students. 4. There was no expenses on costly reagents or equipments as no scientific research was going on. 5. Still, the expenses was ‚Çπ 2730 Crore. In short, Amartya Sen had access to unlimited government fund without any accountability. When Narendra Modi came to know about what all was going in the name of university, he kicked this leech out of the university in 2015 and cancelled all the appointments he had made. Amartya Sen had splurged more than ‚Çπ 2700 Crore on himself and his associates. He lived in US and was drawing 5 Lakh per month and enjoying all allowances from India's taxpayers' money without doing anything. Just because someone is a Nobel laureate doesn't mean that he is totally clean or doesn't have any ulterior intention. Nobel prize or a big degree is no indication of people's nature. Even Manmohan had a PhD degree. That didn't mean he was the best in governance. His government turned out to be the worst in India's independent history. We can never take action against Amartya Sen or technically call him corrupt because he was merely following the \"rules\" and the rules had been made in such a way by the UPA Government that he had the powers to spend as much he wanted without being accountable. That's why he will remain protected and can never be dragged to court. This was a LEGALISED PLUNDER of ‚Çπ 2730 Crore by Amartya Sen. .", "normalised": "Normalised Claim: \"When Nalanda University was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday, it is important to remember its history under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during the UPA era.

During his tenure from 2007 to 2014, ‚Çπ 2730 crore was spent on the university, which was not fully functional. Sen's appointments included individuals with personal connections to former PM Manmohan Singh, such as his daughter Dr. Upinder Singh and associates. Despite the high expenditure, the university had minimal infrastructure and faculty. When Narendra Modi became aware of these issues, he removed Amartya Sen from his position in 2015 and annulled his appointments. The lack of accountability was due to the regulations set by the UPA government, protecting Sen from legal repercussions despite allegations of misuse of funds.\""}

The Indian army had annexed Sindh's Tharparkar district to India and it was declared a new district of Gujarat and the tricolour flag was hoisted on the Muzaffarabad Parliament. When Zulfikar Ali Bhutto came to Shimla to negotiate with Indira Gandhi, he also brought his daughter Benazir Bhutto along with him. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was teaching politics to his daughter. Indira Gandhi put a condition before Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, if you want your 93000 soldiers back then you give us Kashmir. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto told Indira Gandhi that we will not give you Kashmir. I will not sign anything, you keep these 93000 soldiers with yourself. Indira Gandhi had not even dreamed that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was a bigger player than her. He knew how to win the war lost on the borders on the table. Indira Gandhi's condition had become such that if someone goes to fast and then Namaz falls on her neck. Pupul Jayakar and Kuldeep Nayyar both have written in their book that Indira Gandhi missed that opportunity and she and her advisors did not have any diplomatic knowledge about how to handle the situation. Under the Geneva Convention, if a country captures a prisoner of war, then it has to take full care of his dignity. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto told his daughter Benazir Bhutto in the hotel in the evening that India's back has been broken in this war. We fought bravely even though we caused a severe blow to India's economy. India has already borne the burden of Bangladeshi refugees. Now how will India accommodate 93000 Pakistani soldiers and if India wants to accommodate 93000 Pakistani soldiers, then accommodate them. And what will we do by taking back those cowardly soldiers? I have made Indira Gandhi's condition like a mole in a snake's neck. And in the end, Indira Gandhi's condition became such that someone eats shoes and also onions. Indira Gandhi also gave Kashmir to Pakistan, returned 93,000 soldiers and left 56 of her soldiers to die in Pakistani jails. And after 8 months, in the desire of Nobel Prize, Tharparkar district included in Gujarat state of India was returned to Pakistan even though 98% of the population of Tharparkar at that time was Hindu.

In response to this injustice, Major Sood‚Äôs wife approached the Bombay High Court. A few months ago, during a hearing, the court expressed dissatisfaction with the government's policy and suggested that the government should view this case positively as a special matter. However, the Shinde government continued to delay, citing policy decisions. Frustrated, the court finally told the Chief Minister directly that if he was unable to make a decision, he should state this in an affidavit, and the court would then take appropriate action. The court, comprising Justice Girish Kulkarni and Justice Firdaus Pooniwala, reprimanded the government, stating that the attitude of delaying rightful claims of the family of a soldier who sacrificed his life for the country was unacceptable. Eventually, after significant pressure and stern remarks from the court, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde approved the matter as a special case. Yesterday, the same Chief Minister sanctioned a prize of 11 crores rupees for Team India's players in one go. The question of whether all these players were originally from Maharashtra did not arise. It's disturbing to see a government that makes the family of a martyred soldier approach the court for their rightful entitlements, while generously disbursing crores from the state treasury to already wealthy cricketers without hesitation.", "normalised": "Normalised Claim: Major Anuj Sood, who had been living in Pune with his family since 2005, was martyred on May 2, 2020, during an operation against terrorists in Handwara, Kupwara district of Jammu and Kashmir. At the age of 30, he sacrificed his life for the country and was posthumously awarded the Shaurya Chakra for his bravery. However, the state government denied his wife the benefits and allowances typically given to the families of martyred soldiers, citing their original residence in another state despite living in Maharashtra for over 15 years. In response, Major Sood‚Äôs wife approached the Bombay High Court, which expressed dissatisfaction with the government's policy and urged it to consider the case as a special matter. Despite this, the Shinde government delayed action, citing policy decisions, prompting the court to instruct the Chief Minister to either make a decision or state his inability to do so in an affidavit. Eventually, under significant court pressure, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde approved the case as a special matter. The situation highlights the inconsistency in the government's actions, as it recently awarded 11 crore rupees to Team India's players without questioning their state of origin, while making the family of a martyred soldier fight for their rightful entitlements."}

{"query_id": "2,887,808", "query": "IRDAI Removes Age Limits on Health Insurance Purchase In a ground-breaking development, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has ushered in a new era in the health insurance sector. With the recent announcement, the regulatory body has eliminated the cap on buying health insurance policies, marking a significant departure from the conventional constraints that often limited individuals in securing comprehensive coverage. This shift holds profound implications for both insurers and policyholders. By abolishing the maximum age restriction on purchasing health insurance plans, IRDAI aims to foster a more inclusive and accessible healthcare ecosystem, ensuring adequate protection against unforeseen medical expenses. Furthermore, this move is poised to stimulate innovation within the insurance sector. Insurers are now incentivised to diversify their product offerings, catering to a broader spectrum of healthcare requirements. Until now, individuals were limited to purchasing a new insurance policy only until the age of 65. However, with the recent changes that have come into effect from April 01, 2024, anyone, regardless of age, is eligible to purchase a new health insurance Furthermore, the insurance regulatory authority has urged health insurance providers to introduce tailored policies aimed at specific demographics, such as senior citizens. Additionally, insurers have been instructed to establish dedicated channels to handle health insurance claims and grievances specifically for senior citizens. In a notification published in the Gazette, IRDAI stated, \"Insurers shall ensure that they offer health insurance products to cater to all age groups. Insurers may design products specifically for senior citizens, students, children, maternity, and any other group as specified by the Competent Authority.\" Moreover, insurers have been mandated to offer health policies to individuals with pre-existing medical conditions of any kind. Consequently, insurers are prohibited from refusing to issue policies to individuals with severe medical conditions like cancer, heart or renal failure, AIDS Here Are Recent Notable Amendments in Health Insurance: Life insurance companies have the option to launch extended health policies lasting up to five years, whereas general insurers and standalone health insurers are limited to offering policies for a maximum period of three years. IRDAI has decreased the health insurance waiting period from 48 months to 36 months. According to the insurance regulator, all pre-existing conditions should be covered after 36 months, regardless of whether the policyholder disclosed them initially or not. Put simply, health insurers are prohibited from rejecting claims based on pre-existing conditions after these 36 months. IRDAI clarified that insurers cannot contest claims after 60 months of continuous coverage. After completing sixty consecutive months of coverage, including portability and migration, insurers cannot challenge policies or claims due to non-disclosure or misrepresentation, except in cases of established fraud. Life insurers are barred from introducing indemnity-based health policies, which compensate for hospital expenses. Instead, they are only permitted to provide benefit-based policies, offering fixed costs upon the occurrence of a covered disease. Life insurers have the liberty to bundle health plans with ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans). Premium adjustments during the policy term are prohibited. For instance, if a customer pays a two-year premium in advance, insurers cannot demand additional payments throughout the policy tenure. However, premium adjustments based on factors like age and risk are allowed at the time of renewal. Insurers are allowed to offer premium payment in instalments for the convenience of policyholders. Travel policies can only be offered by general and health insurers. There is no limit on AYUSH treatment coverage. Treatments under systems like Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy will receive coverage up to the sum insured without any cap. Policyholders with benefit-based policies can file multiple claims with various insurers, enhancing flexibility and options. The proposed regulation seeks to handle the complaints and claims of senior citizens via a specialised channel, ensuring a more tailored and responsive approach to their requirements. ] To conclude: The recent initiatives by IRDAI mark a significant leap forward in India's health insurance sector. By removing age restrictions on purchasing policies, reducing waiting periods for pre-existing conditions, and mandating coverage for various medical treatments, the regulatory body has paved the way for more inclusive and accessible healthcare. These measures not only empower individuals to secure comprehensive coverage tailored to their needs but also encourage insurers to innovate and diversify their product offerings. Furthermore, directives aimed at streamlining processes, such as simplified renewals and dedicated channels for senior citizens, underscore IRDAI's commitment to enhancing customer experience and addressing the evolving needs of policyholders. As the industry embraces these changes, it is poised to foster greater trust, transparency, and efficiency, ultimately advancing the overarching goal of ensuring financial protection and well-being for all segments of society.", "normalised": "Normalised Claim: \"The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has removed age limits on purchasing health insurance, allowing individuals of any age to buy new policies.

Our beloved country is in turmoil, and the world needs to hear our cries for justice and freedom. Government Violations and Brutality The current government, under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina, has shown blatant disregard for human rights and democratic values. In recent times, we have witnessed an unprecedented level of state-sponsored violence and suppression. The government's student wing, known as the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), has been instrumental in silencing dissent and terrorizing those who dare to speak out against the regime. State-Sponsored Violence The police, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), army, and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) have been deployed not to protect the citizens but to crush the voices of opposition. In a shocking display of brutality, these forces have opened fire on peaceful student protesters. Official records indicate that nearly 200 individuals have lost their lives, but the reality is far grimmer. Unofficial reports suggest that the death toll exceeds 2000, with many more injured and missing. The Role of the Student League The Bangladesh Chhatra League, operating with impunity under the protection of the government, has become synonymous with violence and intimidation. This organization has been involved in numerous attacks on students, journalists, and activists, further destabilizing an already fragile democracy. Their actions are not only a violation of human rights but also an affront to the very principles of education and free thought. A Cry for International Intervention Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's regime is a textbook example of fascism, where power is maintained through fear, violence, and suppression of dissent. The international community must not turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed in Bangladesh. We call upon global leaders, human rights organizations, and the United Nations to take immediate and decisive action to hold the Bangladeshi government accountable for its actions. The Path Forward The youth of Bangladesh are not terrorists; we are students yearning for a future where our voices can be heard, where our rights are respected, and where democracy can flourish. We seek a nation where justice prevails over tyranny, where education is a right and not a privilege granted by those in power. In conclusion, I urge the international media and human rights organizations to amplify our voices. The situation in Bangladesh is dire, and immediate intervention is crucial. The world must stand with us in our fight for freedom, justice, and democracy. Promit Dhaka Bangladesh", "normalised": "Normalised Claim: A Bangladeshi student and protester has accused Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government of human rights violations and state-sponsored violence, calling for international intervention to address the oppressive regime and support the fight for justice and democracy in Bangladesh."}

Sr citizens of India are not eligible for medical insurance after 70 years, they do not get loan on EMI. Driving license is not issued. They are not given any work, hence they depend on others for survival .They had paid all the taxes, insurance premiums upto the age of retirement ie 60-65. Now even after becoming sr citizens, they have to pay all the taxes. There is no scheme for sr citizens in India. 50% discount on railways/air travel, has also been discontinued. The other side of the picture is that sr citizens in politics MLA, MP or Minister, are given every possible benefit and they also get pensions. I fail to understand why all others (except some Govt employees) are denied the same facilities. Imagine, if the children are not caring about them ,where will they go. If the elders of the country go against the Govt in elections, it will affect the election results . Government will have to face the consequences. Srs have the power to change the government, don't ignore them. They have the life long experience to change the Govt. Don't consider them weak ! So many schemes are required for the benefits of seniors . The govt spends a lot of money on welfare schemes, but never realizes about sr citizens. On the contrary, the income of sr citizens is decreasing due to reduction in interest rates of banks. If some of them are getting a meager pension to support the family & self, it is also subject to income tax. So sr citizens should be considered for some benefits : (1). All citizens above 60 must be given pension (2). Everybody must be given pension as per status (3). Concession in railway, bus & air travel. (4). Insurance should be must for all upto the last breath & premium must be paid by the Govt. (5). Court cases of sr citizens must be given priority for early decision. (6). Sr. citizens homes in every city with all facilities (7). Govt should amend the rule of scrapping 10 -15 yrs old used cars.This rule should be applied only for commercial vehicles. Our cars are purchased on loan & our uses are only 40 to 50000 km in 10 yrs. Our cars are as good as new one. If our cars are scrapped, then we must be given new cars. I request all Sr citizens and youth to share it on all social media.

Swami Vivekananda had of-course heard about the respected industrialist. As the conversation grew J.N. Tata explained that he was on his way to Germany. \"I have with me several sacks of soil, from various parts of India. I am taking these samples of soil to Germany. I wish to know if Iron can be extracted profitably from any of these districts.\" said J.N. Tata to the Saint. To which Swami Vivekananda replied, \"Well, Sir, even if these sacks contain Iron-rich soil, do you honestly believe that the Germans will tell you the TRUTH??? You must understand that NONE of the European Nations wish to see a Strong / Steel-Rich / Economically Independent India. The soil is probably rich in Iron-ore but the sad truth is all you will get from your enquiries across Europe is *Disbelief and Pessimistic reactions.*\" Needless to say, having interacted with several Europeans J.N. Tata knew this to be true. Swami Vivekananda continued, *\"Why don't you start an excellent & up-to-date Research Facility and College in India???* Why don't you train some good Indian Youngsters to identify soil and conduct these tests and find ways of profitably extracting metals??? It may seem like a wasteful, burdensome expenditure right now. But in the long run it will save you many trips to Europe and you can have the assurance of knowing the Truth quickly, rather than taking multiple opinions due to suspicion & doubt\". As he could clearly sense J.N. Tata's mood was in acquiescence Swami Vivekananda further elaborated, \"Seek an audience with the Maharaja of Mysore H.R.H. Wodeyar. Though a subordinate of the British, he will definitely help you in every way he can............ .....H.R.H. Wodeyar has been generous enough to sponsor my own trip to Chicago to attend the Parliament of Religions\". As soon as he returned to India, J.N. Tata headed straight for Mysore. And indeed H.R.H.

In those days, the fear of TB was just like the fear of AIDS today... because there was no cure for TB then and a person would die bit by bit... in agony and would become a skeleton... and no one would even go near a TB patient because TB spreads through the breath... People would admit the patients to a TB sanatorium built in a hilly area... Nehru admitted his wife to a sanatorium in Prague, Yugoslavia [today Czech Republic], with another person...

We were to receive Mr Lachhman Singh Rathore who was visiting our Flight Unit to perform the last rites of his son, Flying Officer Vikram Singh. Only the day before, I had sent the telegram, ‚ÄúDeeply regret to inform that your son Flying Officer Vikram Singh lost his life in a flying accident early this morning. Death was instantaneous.‚Äù It was the first time for me- to meet and manage the bereaved next of kin, in this case the Father of the brave officer. While most of the desolate family members insist on seeing the body, many a time there isn‚Äôt a body to show !! Flying Officer Vikram Singh‚Äôs remains were only a few kilos ‚Äìscrapped from what was left in the cockpit. We had to weigh the wooden coffin with wood and earth. The pilot brought the helicopter to a perfect touchdown. Soon Mr Lachhman Singh Rathor was helped down the ladder.A small and frail man he was, maybe of 80 years, clad in an immaculate dhoti. As I approached him, he asked in a quiet and dignified whisper, ‚ÄúAre you Venki, the Flight Commander?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes Sir.‚Äù ‚ÄúVikram had spoken to me about you. I‚Äôd like to speak to you alone for a minute.‚Äù We walked to the edge of the concrete apron. ‚ÄòI have lost a son, and you have lost a friend.

Later, I would like to meet Vikram‚Äôs friends, see his room and, if it is permitted, visit his work place. I then would like to return home tomorrow morning.‚Äù A commander couldn‚Äôt have given me clearer instructions. The funeral, with full military honours, was concluded by late afternoon. After the final echoes of the ‚ÄòLast Post‚Äô faded away, Lachhman Singh spent the evening talking to the Squadron Pilots. Vikram‚Äôs roommate took him to see Vikram‚Äôs room. Lachhman Singh desired to spend the night in his son‚Äôs room instead of the guest house we had reserved for him. Early next morning after a tour of the squadron area, my boss took him to his office. A while later, the staff car took Lachhman Singh to the civil airfield two hours away. As the car disappeared round the corner, I remarked to my Boss, ‚ÄúA brave man he is.

I admire him.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, Mr Lachhman Singh Rathore is a warrior in his own way.

His 2nd son, Major Bir Singh, died along the Ichogil Canal in 1965 in an ambush. His youngest, the 3rd, Vikram Singh, who had the courage to join the Air Force, is also gone now, more to our country‚Äôs defence than All of us combined.‚Äù Yes, he is indeed a brave Indian ; in fact HE is MORE INDIAN than anyone else - His sacrifice can never ever be repaid by the Country !!
