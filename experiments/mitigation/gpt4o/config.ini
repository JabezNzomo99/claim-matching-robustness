prompt_template = "You will be provided with a noisy input claim from a social media post. 
    The input claim may contain informal language, typos, abbreviations, double negations and dialectal variations.
    Your task is to normalise the claim to a more formal and standardised version while preserving the original meaning.

    Ensure that:
    - The normalised claim conveys the same main claim as the original.

    Noisy Claim: "Wah, Biden just sign order today, cannot call ‘China virus’ liao"
    Normalised Claim: "President Joe Biden issued an executive order today banning the term ‘China virus.’"

    Noisy Claim: "Soros son sez he and dad pickd Harris 4 VP after pic interview!"
    Normalised Claim: "George Soros son revealed that he and his father chose Kamala Harris as the Vice President after a picture interview."

    Noisy Claim: "It is not untrue that President-elect Joe Biden’s German shepherd, Major, is set to become the first shelter dog in the White House."
    Normalised Claim: "President-elect Joe Biden’s German shepherd, Major, is set to become the first shelter dog in the White House."
