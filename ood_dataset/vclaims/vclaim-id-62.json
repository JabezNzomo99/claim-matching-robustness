    "full_text": "A post is being shared on social media claiming it as former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee's speech about the Kashmir issue at the United Nations Organisation (UNO). This post claims that when Vajpayee was sent as India's representative to the UN during the PV Narasimha Rao led government, Vajpayee expressed his views by narrating a short story of Rishi Kashyap. According to the post, a Pakistan delegate had objected to Vajpayee's story and admitted that Pakistan was not at all in existence during Rishi Kashyap's visit to Kashmir. Let's verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Former Atal Bihari Vajpayee's speech about the Kashmir issue at the United Nations organisation.\n\nFact: The post shared is an edited fictional story published in 'Kushwant Singh's Joke Book 9'. This fictional quote of an Indian politician narrating Rishi Kashyap's story in the UN was contributed by a New Delhi man named Vipin Buckshey. This story has nothing to do with Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn searching for the details of the claims made in the post, it is found out that P. V. Narasimha Rao led Congress Government had sent Atal Bihari Vajpayee to lead the Indian delegation to the 1994 Geneva session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNHCR). The Vajpayee led Indian delegation had successfully thwarted the UN Resolution against India on Kashmir Issue. However, it is nowhere reported that Vajpayee had narrated the story of Rishi Kashyap while addressing the UNHCR.\n\nWhen we searched for the details of this story shared in the post using keywords, it is found out that this story was re-created by editing a fictional joke published in 'Kushwant Singh's Joke Book 9'.\n\nThis fictional story was contributed by New Delhi based Vipin Buckshey.\n\nTo sum it up, a fictional story from 'Kushwant Singh's Joke Book 9' is edited and shared as Vajpayee's speech in United Nations in the 1990s.",

    "vclaim": "A viral social media post claims that former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee narrated a story about Rishi Kashyap during a speech on Kashmir at the UN when he was India's representative during PV Narasimha Rao's government. The story about Rishi Kashyap and Pakistan's delegate's response is actually a fictional story from 'Kushwant Singh's Joke Book 9' contributed by Vipin Buckshey, and was not part of any UN speech by Vajpayee. While Vajpayee did lead the Indian delegation to the 1994 Geneva session of UNHCR and successfully prevented a UN Resolution against India on Kashmir, he never narrated the story of Rishi Kashyap during this session.",
