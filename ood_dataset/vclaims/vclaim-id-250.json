No, The Video Is Clipped!\n\nA video showing several leaders at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, Japan posing for a photograph and then interacting with each other while Prime Minister Narendra Modi stands alone is going viral on social media.\n\nSeveral social media users are sharing the video to claim that Modi is being 'ignored' by the leaders.\n\nWas PM Modi really ignored?: No, this is a clipped video.\n\n\u2022 The extended clip and images from the G7 Summit, held in Hiroshima, shows French President Emmanuel Macron and Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida interacting with Modi before and after taking a group picture.\n\nHow did we find out the truth?:\n\u2022 We noticed 'G7 HIROSHIMA SUMMIT 2023' written on the stage where the leaders were standing for a photograph.\n\u2022 We visited G7 Summit's official website to check visuals around 20 May.\n\u2022 We found that after Modi entered the stage for a group photo, he was greeted by French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\u2022 A 'Family Photo' including 23 leaders was taken at the Summit from where the viral video has been clipped.\n\u2022 A longer video showed Modi and Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida holding hands while interacting with each other after the picture was taken.\n\nConclusion: Clearly, a clipped video is being shared out of context to claim that PM Modi was ignored by the leaders at G7 Hiroshima Summit 2023.",
