    "full_text": "On October 26, 2022, Congress Youth Secretary, Roshni Kushal Jaiswal, claimed in a tweet that Adani's Mumbai airport loan of 12,770 crore has been waived off by SBI. Lets verify it\n\nFact Check\n\nLets first understand the difference between waive off and underwritten loan:\n\nWaive off: The borrower is not required to repay the outstanding loan amount. The borrower is no longer responsible for repaying the loan amount. It entails the lender's complete cancellation of loan recovery. The bank will not pursue legal action against the borrower. The loan is terminated.\n\nUnderwritten: Underwriting a loan refers to the process through which a lender determines whether an applicant is trustworthy and should be granted a loan. As a result, an efficient underwriting and loan approval procedure is a critical criterion for issuing a loan.\n\nIn our research, using the keyword search \"SBI waived off Adani Mumbai airport's 12,770 crore loan\", we came across a report by Business Standard dated March 2022, which stated that the Adani Group received Rs 12,770 crore loan from SBI and completed its funding for the first phase of Navi Mumbai International Airport project.\n\nThe group had announced the signing of finance contracts. The entire debt of Rs 12,770 crore for the airport project has been underwritten by SBI.\n\nSBI did not waive off Rs 12,770 crore loan issued to Adani Group, rather the loan has been underwritten, which means that when providing the loan amount of Rs 12,770, SBI examined Adani Group's creditworthiness. It is done to minimize unnecessary risks that may come if the initiative is deemed a failure.\n\nClaim: SBI waived off Rs 12,770 crore loan given to Adani Group\nClaimed by: Roshni Kushal Jaiswal\nFact Check: False\n\nThe goal of the Only Fact Team is to provide authentic news facts and debunk misinformation to safeguard readers interest.\n\nDear Readers, We are working to debunk fake news which is against India.
