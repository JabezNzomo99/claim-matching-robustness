Share the information with your family and friends.\n\nDO NOT OPEN IT. They also said it on TV\"\n\nTruth: There Is No Morocco Earthquake Seismic Wave Card!\n\nThis is yet another example of FAKE NEWS circulating on WhatsApp, and here are reasons why\u2026\n\nFact #1: There Is No Seismic Wave Card!\n\nFirst, let me just point out that there is no such thing as a Seismic Wave Card.\n\nThe Seismic Wave Card is an Internet hoax that keeps getting recycled for every earthquake that comes along.\n\nFact #2: Photos Are Shared Directly On WhatsApp\n\nThere is no need to open any file, or install any app, to view photos on WhatsApp. You simply click to view photos shared by other people on WhatsApp.\n\nFact #3: Seismic Waves Card Is Not A Browser Hijacker\n\nThere is no evidence that a malware or browser hijacker called Seismic Waves Card exists.\n\nFact #4: Image-Based Malware Is Possible, But\u2026\n\nDigital steganography is a method by which secret messages and other data can be hidden in digital files, like a photo or a video, or even a music file.\n\nIt is also possible to embed malicious code within a photo, but it won't be a full-fledged malware that can execute by itself.\n\nAt most, it can be used to hide the malware payload from antivirus scanners, but it cannot hack your smartphone by itself.\n\nFact #5: Image-Based Malware Requires User Action\n\nEven in sophisticated image-based malware scenarios, infection requires user action. You cannot get infected by the Trojan if you practice good \"Internet hygiene\" by not downloading or installing anything from unknown websites.\n\nFact #6: Malicious Code Executes Immediately\n\nIf you accidentally download and trigger malware, it will execute immediately. It won't take 10 seconds, as the hoax message claims.\n\nThere is really no reason for malware to wait before it infects your devices. Waiting will only increase the risk of detection.\n\nPlease help us FIGHT FAKE NEWS by sharing this fact check article out, and please SUPPORT our work!",

    "vclaim": "A viral warning claims that a \"Seismic Wave Card\" containing photos of the Morocco earthquake can hack phones in 10 seconds if opened on WhatsApp. The Seismic Wave Card warning is a hoax that gets recycled for different earthquakes, and no such malicious file exists. While image-based malware is technically possible, it cannot automatically hack a phone without user action and would not wait 10 seconds to execute.",
