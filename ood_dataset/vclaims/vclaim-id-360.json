Officials estimate nearly 7 lakh kanals more remains to be cleared. The leaders who have faced action include those belonging to the BJP.\n\nThe Jammu and Kashmir administration claims to have retrieved 15 lakh kanals or 1.87 lakh acres of state and 'ghacharai (grazing)' land across the Union Territory since an anti-encroachment drive was launched in early January, including from several senior leaders across parties.\n\nOf the 15 lakh kanals retrieved, almost half (7 lakh kanals) fall in Kashmir. Officials estimate nearly 7 lakh kanals more remains to be cleared. The leaders who have faced action include those belonging to the BJP.\n\nLast fortnight, revenue officials seized land that they said was shown in revenue records as belonging to senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta in village Ghaink in Jammu (23.9 kanals or nearly 3 acres); as well as land occupied by a relative of former CMs Farooq and Omar Abdullah in Srinagar (40 kanals or 5 acres).\n\nThe drive has provoked protests both in Jammu and Kashmir provinces. The administration's repeated public announcements that people who have built residential houses on \"small portions of state land\" would not be touched have not calmed fears. Worried about the impact, BJP leaders have called on Lt Governor Manoj Sinha to ensure \"the poor\" are not affected in the action.\n\nWhile the allotment of the land to Gupta had been cancelled in 2016 following a PIL, it was retrieved only now. A senior revenue officer said they found several cases of people re-encroaching land retrieved from them during earlier drives.\n\nGupta, who had earlier denied owning any state land in Ghaink, did not respond to repeated attempts to contact him.\n\nOther senior BJP leaders who have faced action are Colonel (retired) Mahan Singh and Prem Sagar Aziz. Officials claim to have retrieved 9 kanals and 15 marlas of land in Kathua from Singh, who as District Development Council Chairman enjoys Minister of State status. In Basohli area, 4.10 kanals of land was reportedly seized from Aziz, a former minister.\n\nSingh claimed that the land seized was part of 34 kanals of ancestral property belonging to his family and 13 others. \"As I was serving in the Army, the co-sharers who are mostly BPL families cultivated it\u2026 The revenue officials continued entering records in my name\u2026 as I too inherited a portion of it,'' he said.\n\nAziz said he had purchased the land in question around 38 years ago and, under provisions of the now-scrapped Roshni Act, paid Rs 44,000 to the authorities to get ownership rights transferred in his name. (Officials describe the land as \"high value\" and worth nearly Rs 2.4 crore.)\n\n\"A few days ago, when revenue officials came and said the land belonged to the state, I handed it over myself,\" he said, adding that the matter was pending in court.\n\nIn Jammu province, two other senior leaders have received notices \u2013 the BJP's Abdul Ghani Kohli (BJP) and J&K Apni Party's Zulfikar Chowdhary. Both were Cabinet ministers in the 2014-18 PDP-BJP coalition government.\n\nKohli refused to say anything saying the matter was sub-judice. Chowdhary said he had purchased nearly 12 kanals in 2006, and that the 3 kanals of it now claimed to be state land had exchanged hands 14 times earlier. The Apni Party leader said he had no way of knowing it was state land as the seller had the necessary papers.\n\nChowdhary also claimed that \"as soon as I got the notice\", he told revenue officials to retrieve the land. \"Why should I fight for something which does not belong to me?'' he said, adding that the administration should spare a thought for the poor, who might face action under the sweeping drive for owning less than an acre of land with houses built on it.\n\n\"Retrieving state land from the rich and influential is okay, but the government has a duty to resettle the poor,\" he said.\n\n(The text continues with details about land retrievals from other prominent politicians and leaders, including Nedou's Hotel, various political figures from the National Conference, PDP, and other parties.)\n\nThe article concludes with a statement from Chief Secretary Arun Kumar Mehta about retrieving state land from \"big vested interests\" for public use, and criticism from the PDP about the anti-encroachment drive.",

    "vclaim": "The Jammu and Kashmir administration has retrieved 15 lakh kanals (1.87 lakh acres) of state and grazing land through an anti-encroachment drive launched in January. The anti-encroachment drive has targeted properties belonging to several prominent political leaders, including those from BJP, such as former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta and relatives of former CMs Farooq and Omar Abdullah. The drive has sparked protests in both Jammu and Kashmir provinces, despite administration's assurances that small residential properties would not be affected. Several BJP leaders and former ministers, including Col. Mahan Singh, Prem Sagar Aziz, Abdul Ghani Kohli, and J&K Apni Party's Zulfikar Chowdhary, have faced action or received notices under the drive. Officials estimate that approximately 7 lakh kanals more of encroached land remains to be cleared in the region.",
