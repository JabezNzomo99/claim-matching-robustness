    "full_text": "India unlikely to travel to Pakistan, Champions Trophy in hybrid model: Sources\n\nChampions Trophy 2025: The tournament is likely to be held in a hybrid model in February-March because it is highly unlikely that India would travel to Pakistan to play the ODI matches. Pakistan have the hosting rights for the Champions Trophy, which will make its return to the cricket calendar for the first time since 2017.\n\nKey Points:\n- A couple of matches in the tournament are likely to be held in either the UAE or Sri Lanka\n- Pakistan Cricket Board submitted a draft schedule with India's matches scheduled in Lahore\n- No official confirmation from BCCI regarding travel at the moment\n\nSource Details:\n\"It is highly unlikely that the team will travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy but a final decision will be taken by the government. So, in that case, a hybrid model is being worked out. India may play their matches in UAE or Sri Lanka just like the Asia Cup.\"\n\nBackground Context:\n- India have not played bilateral cricket with Pakistan since the 2012-13 season\n- India have not traveled to Pakistan since 2008\n- Former Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur previously stated that India would not resume bilateral cricket ties until Pakistan stops cross-border terrorism\n\nRecent Precedent:\nLast year, Pakistan were forced to host the Asia Cup in a hybrid model after India refused to travel to the neighboring country. India's matches were played in Sri Lanka, and they went on to win the tournament.\n\nTournament Preparations:\n- ICC head of events Chris Tetley recently met PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi\n- PCB allocated approximately 17 billion rupees for upgrading stadiums in Karachi, Lahore, and Rawalpindi\n- The tournament will feature 8 teams\n- Pakistan won the Champions Trophy in 2017, beating India in the final",

    "vclaim": "India is unlikely to travel to Pakistan for the 2025 Champions Trophy, leading to a probable hybrid model where India's matches would be played in UAE or Sri Lanka. Pakistan Cricket Board has submitted a draft schedule proposing India's matches to be played in Lahore. India has not played bilateral cricket with Pakistan since 2012-13 and has not traveled to Pakistan since 2008. The Pakistan Cricket Board has allocated 17 billion rupees for upgrading stadiums in Karachi, Lahore, and Rawalpindi for the tournament. A similar hybrid model was used for the Asia Cup last year where India's matches were played in Sri Lanka instead of Pakistan.",
