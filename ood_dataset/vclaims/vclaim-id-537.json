    "full_text": "Pride and Prejudice\n\nPride and Prejudice is a romantic novel by Jane Austen, published anonymously in three volumes in 1813. A classic of English literature, written with incisive wit and superb character delineation, it centers on the burgeoning relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. Upon publication, Pride and Prejudice was well received by critics and readers. The first edition sold out within the first year, and it never went out of print.\n\nCharacters\n\nThe novel is set in rural England at the turn of the 19th century and follows the Bennet family, which includes five very different sisters. The eldest, Jane, is sweet-tempered and modest. She is her sister Elizabeth's confidant and friend. Elizabeth, the heroine of the novel, is intelligent and high-spirited. She shares her father's distaste for the conventional views of society as to the importance of wealth and rank. The third daughter, Mary, is plain, bookish, and pompous, while Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest, are flighty and immature.\n\nMr. Bennet is the family patriarch. He is fond of his two eldest daughters\u2014especially his favorite, Elizabeth\u2014but takes a passive interest in the younger ones, ultimately failing to curb their childish instincts. An intelligent but eccentric and sarcastic man, he does not care for society's conventions and mocks his wife's obsession with finding suitable husbands for their daughters. Mrs. Bennet is rightfully concerned about her daughters' marital prospects due to an entail that will leave them without an inheritance.\n\nThroughout the novel, the Bennet sisters encounter several eligible bachelors, including Charles Bingley, Darcy, Lieutenant George Wickham, and William Collins. Bingley is described as good-looking and gentlemanlike, having come by his fortune through trade. Darcy, in contrast, is a product of hierarchical thinking, believing in the natural superiority of the wealthy landed gentry. He is arrogant but perceptive.\n\nWickham is attractive and charming, making him immediately popular among the women in the nearby town of Meryton. Collins, a clergyman, is described as not sensible and poorly educated, whose patron is Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Darcy's controlling aunt.\n\nOther supporting characters include Elizabeth's friend Charlotte Lucas, the Gardiner family, Bingley's snobbish sisters, and Darcy's shy but good-humored sister Georgiana.",
