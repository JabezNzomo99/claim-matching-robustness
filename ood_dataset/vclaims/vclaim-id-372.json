A keyword search for \"Maharashtra government free ride scheme woman\" did not throw up any credible reports of such a scheme.\n\nA search for the helpline number mentioned in the graphic (7837018555) led to a Hindustan Times report dated December 1, 2019, titled \"Police launch free night pick-and-drop for women in Ludhiana\". According to the report, police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said, \"Any woman not able to get a vehicle to get home between 10pm and 6am can call the police helpline numbers \u2014 112, 1091 and 7837018555 \u2014 to request the facility which will be available on all days. A police control room (PCR) van or a station house officer (SHO) vehicle will come and drop her safely to her destination free-of-cost.\"\n\nA Times of India report dated December 5, 2019, stated that the Ludhiana police helpline numbers 1091 and 7832018555 had gone viral, with calls received from as far as UP, Maharashtra, and Kerala. Police officers told outstation callers that the helpline numbers were only for women in Ludhiana.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Ludhiana Police's initiative to provide free rides for women unable to find a cab at night has been falsely claimed to be a scheme of the Maharashtra government.\n\nResult: False",

The free night pick-and-drop service for women was actually launched by Ludhiana Police in Punjab in 2019. The viral helpline numbers (7837018555, 112, and 1091) belong to Ludhiana Police's women safety initiative, not Maharashtra government.",
