We cherish our friendship with the people of India and look forward to enhancing and strengthening this wonderful relationship now and in the future.\"\n\nSheikh Nahyan praised the BAPS Sanstha for hosting an interfaith gathering celebrating the holy month.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity for us to collectively reflect on our good fortune of living and working in the UAE. It's also an opportunity to appreciate the significance of peace, tolerance, human fraternity, and interfaith harmony in the country,\" Sheikh Nahyan noted.\n\nPujya Swami Brahmaviharidas, who led the temple project from the BAPS Sanstha, thanked the UAE leaders and ministers for their constant love and support.\n\n\"This is a month of self-discipline and self-introspection. It's a month of expressing our gratitude and generosity. It's also a month of genune feelings and friendship. I feel that all the blessings of all the fasting you have done, all the rituals and ceremonies and prayers you have performed, have all been collected in this premises today,\" Swami Brahmaviharidas told the attendees.\n\nLater, Swami Brahmaviharidas narrated a moral tale promoting love, friendship, and harmony.\n\nThe interfaith event was marked by engaging discussions among attendees fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the multicultural environment in the UAE. Later, there were traditional cultural performances, and attendees were treated to sumptuous pure vegetarian food made by the BAPS volunteers.",
