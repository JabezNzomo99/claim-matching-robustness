    "full_text": "Fact check: False claim that Putin rescued 35,000 imprisoned Ukrainian children\n\nThe claim: Russian President Vladimir Putin rescued 35,000 imprisoned Ukrainian children\n\nNearly 4.8 million Ukrainian children have been displaced amid the Russian invasion, but some online claim the attack is a \"special operation\" to help save their lives.\n\nA Facebook post shared April 16 shows an image of Russian President Vladimir Putin kissing a child's hand. \"President Vladimir Putin released 35,000 children from tunnels and subways in Ukraine,\" reads the caption of the post.\n\nThe post includes a link to an April 5 article from Real Raw News, a website that has previously published false claims. Citing an unnamed Mar-a-Lago source, the article claims Putin told former President Donald Trump about this rescue effort in a phone call.\n\nThe post generated over 200 interactions in less than a week. Another Facebook post shared April 11 includes a link to the Real Raw News article with the caption, \"Finally some good news.\" Similar posts have amassed hundreds of interactions on Twitter.\n\nBut the claim is false. There is no evidence Putin rescued 35,000 imprisoned Ukrainian children. The claim ties into the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nUSA TODAY found no evidence in credible news reports or on the Russian government's official website that indicates Putin rescued 35,000 imprisoned Ukrainian children.\n\nThe Real Raw News article ties into the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, which alleges there is a global cabal of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic child sex traffickers that use underground tunnels. The conspiracy theory's claims have been debunked.\n\nA disclaimer on Real Raw News' about page says the site \"contains humor, parody, and satire.\" However, the disclaimer is not included in the article, leading social media users to take its claim as fact.\n\nThe picture in the Facebook post is also unrelated to the Russian invasion. It shows Putin kissing a girl's hand in 2012 during celebrations marking the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Borodino.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that Putin rescued 35,000 imprisoned Ukrainian children. There is no evidence to support the claim, which ties into the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.",

    "vclaim": "Social media posts falsely claimed that Vladimir Putin rescued 35,000 children from tunnels and subways in Ukraine. The viral claim originated from Real Raw News, a website known for publishing false information and satire. The image used in the Facebook post shows Putin kissing a girl's hand in 2012 during a Battle of Borodino anniversary celebration, not during any rescue operation in Ukraine. The false narrative is connected to the debunked QAnon conspiracy theory about underground child trafficking tunnels.",
