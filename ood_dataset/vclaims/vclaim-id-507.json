The text content is minimal, with only the header \"TIMETABLE AND SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE EDO AND ONDO STATE GOVERNORSHIP ELECTIONS\" being present. There is also a reference to the \"Next Election: Ondo State Governorship Elections-16th November 2024\" in the countdown timer section.]\n\nThe large number of images in the HTML suggest this is a visual document showing detailed election activities, but the text extraction cannot reproduce the visual schedule content. The actual details would need to be derived from examining the images directly.",
