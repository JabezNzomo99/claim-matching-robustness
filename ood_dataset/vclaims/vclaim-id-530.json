    "full_text": "Times Fact Check: The Viral WhatsApp Forward on 'Challenge Vote' and 'Tender Vote' is a Hoax\n\nHighlights:\n1. A WhatsApp forward is spreading misinformation about the concept of 'challenge vote' and 'tender vote'.\n2. The message makes false claims about a person being able to vote even if his/her name is not on voter list.\n3. It also wrongly quotes section 49a.\n\nClaim:\nA message widely shared on WhatsApp makes several fictitious claims about the voting process. Here's the message:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 When you reach polling booth and find that your name is not in voter list, just show your Aadhar card or voter ID and ask for \"challenge vote\" under section 49A and cast your vote.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you find that someone has already cast your vote, then ask for \"tender vote\" and cast your vote.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If any polling booth records more than 14% tender votes, repolling will be conducted in such polling booth.\n\nFact Check:\n\nClaim 1: \"When you reach the polling booth and find that your name is not on the voter list, just show your Aadhar card or voter ID and ask for 'challenge vote' under section 49A and cast your vote.\"\n\nThis is FALSE. Any person whose name is not on electoral rolls simply cannot vote.\n\nThe concept of 'challenge vote' is wrongly explained. The correct term is 'challenged vote', where polling agents challenge a voter's identity and the presiding officer conducts an inquiry. It has nothing to do with challenging using Aadhar card or voter ID.\n\nFurthermore, Section 49A of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, discusses the design of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and makes no mention of 'challenge vote'.\n\nThe Election Commission of India spokesperson confirmed that a person with a missing name on the voter list cannot vote.\n\nClaim 2: \"If you find that someone has already cast your vote, then ask for 'tender vote' and cast your vote.\"\n\nThis claim is TRUE. As per the Election Commission, under section 42 of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, a 'tendered vote' allows a person to mark a ballot paper if another person has already voted under their name, subject to certain conditions.\n\nClaim 3: \"If any polling booth records more than 14% tender votes, repolling will be conducted.\"\n\nThis is FALSE. Technically, tendered votes are considered only when they might affect the election outcome, such as when the margin of victory is less than the number of tendered votes.\n\nThere is no specific percentage prescribed by the Election Commission for a repoll, making the 14% figure completely imaginary.\n\nVerdict:\nTimes Fact Check has found two of three claims in the viral WhatsApp message about India's voting process to be false.",

    "title": "Firstly, if your name is not on the voter list, you cannot vote. The concept of \u2018challenge vote\u2019 is wrongly explained. The correct phrase is \u2018challenged vote\u2019 and under this, the polling agents challenge the identity of a voter and the presiding officer holds an inquiry into the challenge. Therefore, it has got nothing to do with challenging using Aadhar card or voter ID. The claim under tender vote is true. As per judiciary, tendered votes are to be considered only when they are likely to affect the outcome of the election, that is, when the margin of victory is less than the number of tendered vote. So the third claim is false.",
    "vclaim": "A viral WhatsApp message falsely claims that voters can cast a \"challenge vote\" under Section 49A using Aadhar card or voter ID if their name is not on the voter list. The message correctly states that voters can request a \"tender vote\" if someone has already voted in their name. The message falsely claims that polling booths with more than 14% tender votes will automatically trigger repolling.",
