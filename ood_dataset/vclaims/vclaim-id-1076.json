    "full_text": "Is COVID-19 XBB Variant 5x 'More Toxic Than Delta?' Post is Alarmist!\n\nAmid a surge of COVID-19 infections in China, a viral text message regarding a new wave due to the XBB variant of the COVID-19 virus is being widely shared on social media. It makes several claims regarding the virus' spread and effects. A few pointers in the message say:\n\n- Patients will not have cough or fever as the symptoms of the infection.\n- Those infected might experience aches, pains, pneumonia, and a loss of appetite.\n- It claims that XBB is five times \"more toxic\" and has a higher mortality rate than the Delta variant. \n- People being tested for this variant show false negative results, and that the nasopharyngeal tests \"generally test negative\" for this \"highly contagious, highly virulent, and lethal\" virus.\n\nFact: The claims made in the viral text are misleading. \n\n- To begin with, XBB is not a new variant, it is a subvariant of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. \n- According to a statement published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 27 October 2022, XBB is a recombined subvariant, a sub-lineage of the Omicron variants BA.2.10.1 and BA.2.75.\n- Speaking to The Quint, Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, physician and epidemiologist, said, \"XBB is a BA.2 subvariant and is not very different from previous variants of Omicron.\"\n\nIs it more 'deadly'?: Simply put, the XBB subvariant will not \"alter much\" for those with previous exposure to the Omicron (BA.2) variant.\n\n- According to a COVID-19 insights blog post by The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation's (IHME) dated 24 October, people who were previously infected with the Omicron variant will \"maintain their immunity against the new subvariant.\"\n- Calling the XBB subvariant \"just like any other (Omicron) variant,\" Dr Lahariya said that there was \"nothing to worry about.\"\n- The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) also issued a statement that said that there was no report in \"increase in severity of disease,\" and that it was \"mild like with other Omicron sub-lineages\" among Indian patients.\n\nBut what about reinfections?: Dr Lahariya told The Quint, that reinfections were \"nothing to be worried about... especially in populations which have been affected by any different Omicron variant, for them it doesn't alter anything.\"\n\n- WHO's statement mentioned that as of 9 October, the XBB subvariant had been detected in 35 countries and the data they had did not suggest \"substantial difference in disease severity for XBB infections.\"\n\nEarly evidence suggested a high risk of reinfection, but was limited to those who had first been infected in the pre-Omicron period. IMHE's blog also stated the same point, mentioning that those who had low \"past Omicron infection\" were at risk, predicting that winters in the Northern Hemisphere would bring in \"more infections, but not a large increase in deaths.\"\n\nDr Lahariya emphasized that the XBB subvariant was \"not very different from previous variants of Omicron,\" adding that \"for the populations that have not been exposed to the previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, for them any variant could be dangerous.\"\n\nRegarding symptoms, Dr Lahariya noted that the text saying \"no cough, no fever\" is true for all Omicron variants for vaccinated, previously exposed populations, with no difference for XBB or any other variant.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) also called the message 'fake' on its verified Twitter account.\n\nConclusion: The viral text calling XBB a new variant of Omicron, making claims regarding the subvariant's symptoms and severity is misleading.",

    "title": "Hello, \n\nThank you for reaching out to us. \nWe spoke to Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, physician and epidemiologist, who said that the message is \"incorrect\" and that the XBB variant is another Omicron variant. He also added that there was \"nothing to worry about.\"",
    "vclaim": "A viral message claims the COVID-19 XBB variant is five times more toxic than Delta, has no cough or fever symptoms, and shows false negative test results. XBB is actually a subvariant of Omicron, not a new variant, and is not significantly different from previous Omicron variants in terms of severity. The XBB subvariant does not cause increased disease severity compared to other Omicron variants, particularly in populations previously exposed to Omicron. While there is a risk of reinfection with XBB, it primarily affects those who were infected in the pre-Omicron period rather than those with previous Omicron exposure.",
