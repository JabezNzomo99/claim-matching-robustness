    "full_text": "'Thermonuclear bad': Experts fear 'millions of deaths' as China reels under Covid explosion\n\nHospitals overwhelmed, crematoriums strained, medicines running out ... China is grappling with a massive wave of Covid-19 infections just days after the authorities abruptly ended the tight Covid zero policy.\n\nThe abrupt end of restrictions has now raised concerns of widespread infections among a vulnerable, undervaccinated population with little natural immunity.\n\nChina is already seeing an increase in Covid deaths across a swath of the country that aren't being reported in government figures, according to social media posts, adding to speculation that officials are masking the full impact of their abrupt shift away from Covid Zero.\n\nGlobally too, concern is rising about Beijing's surprise decision to let the virus run free, with US and European officials keeping a close eye on the situation.\n\n'60% of China to be infected'\nEpidemiologist estimate that more than 60 per cent of China and 10 per cent of Earth's population are likely to be infected over the next 90 days with deaths likely in the millions.\n\n\"THERMONUCLEAR BAD\u2014Hospitals completely overwhelmed in China ever since restrictions dropped. Epidemiologist estimate >60% of China & 10% of Earth's population likely infected over next 90 days. Deaths likely in the millions\u2014plural. This is just the start,\" Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist, tweeted.\n\nAccording to Feigl-Ding, the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) goal is \"let whoever needs to be infected, infected, let whoever needs to die, die. Early infections, early deaths, early peak, early resumption of production.\"\n\nCrematoriums struggle\nOne of Beijing's designated crematoria for Covid-19 patients has been flooded with dead bodies in recent days as the virus sweeps through the Chinese capital.\n\nThe harrowing images offer an early hint at the human cost of the country's abrupt loosening of pandemic restrictions, reported Wall Street Journal (WSJ).\n\nNot just Beijing, crematoriums across China told news agency AFP that they were straining to deal with an influx of bodies.\n\nHospitals are struggling and pharmacy shelves have been stripped bare in the wake of the Chinese government's sudden decision last month to lift nearly three years of lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing.\n\nIn Chongqing \u2013 a city of 30 million where authorities this week urged people with \"mild\" Covid symptoms to go to work \u2013 one crematorium told AFP they had run out of space to keep bodies.\n\n\"The number of bodies picked up in recent days is many times more than previously,\" a staffer who did not give their name said.\n\nIn the central city of Baoding, an employee of a crematorium told AFP: \"Of course we're busy, which workplace isn't busy now?\"\n\nOutside the city's Dongjiao Crematorium, AFP reporters saw more than a dozen vehicles waiting to enter, most of them hearses or funerary coaches displaying sombre-coloured ribbons and bouquets of flowers.\n\nGrim estimates\nAccording to various estimates, the tsunami of new cases would overload the health system and could result in up to 2 million deaths, or more.\n\nZhou Jiatong, head of the Center for Disease Control in southwestern Guangxi region, said last month in a paper published by the Shanghai Journal of Preventive Medicine that mainland China faces more than 2 million deaths if it loosened Covid curbs in the same way Hong Kong did this year.\n\nInfections could rise to more than 233 million, his forecast showed.\n\nIn May, scientists in China and the United States estimated that China risks just over 1.5 million Covid deaths if it drops its tough Covid zero policy without any safeguards such as ramping up vaccination and access to treatments, according to research published in Nature Medicine.\n\nThey forecasted that peak demand on intensive care would be more than 15 times capacity, causing roughly 1.5 million deaths, based on worldwide data gathered about the variant's severity.\n\nHowever, the researchers, the lead authors among whom were from Fudan University in China, said the death toll could be reduced sharply if there was a focus on vaccination.\n\nBritish scientific information and analytics company Airfinity said in late November that China could see 1.3 million to 2.1 million people die if it lifts its Covid zero policy due to low vaccination and booster rates as well as a lack of hybrid immunity.\n\nThe company said it modelled its data on Hong Kong's BA.1 wave in February, which occurred after the city eased restrictions after two years.\n\nWorld fears new China Covid wave\nOfficials and global health experts outside China are now anxiously watching the Covid-19 surge in the country.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Monday the potential for the virus to mutate as it spreads in China was \"a threat for people everywhere\".\n\nSome US and European officials are struggling to figure out how, or if, they can help mitigate a crisis they fear will hurt the global economy, further constrain corporate supply chains and spawn new coronavirus variants of concern.\n\n\"We have made that point that we are prepared to help in any way they might find acceptable,\" US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday.\n\nAdvance preparation of the healthcare system, accurate and shared data collection, and open communication are all important to battling mass coronavirus infections, say health experts from countries outside China who struggled through their own Covid waves. Many of those elements appear to be lacking in China, they say.\n\n\"China's vaccine nationalism is deeply tied to Xi's pride, and accepting Western assistance would not only embarrass Xi, it would also pierce his oft-propagandized narrative that China's governance model is superior,\" said Craig Singleton, deputy director of the China program at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies.\n\nEuropean and US officials are conducting careful behind-the-scenes talks with Chinese counterparts, while issuing deliberately worded public statements intended to make clear that the ball is in Beijing's court.",

    "vclaim": "China is experiencing a massive wave of COVID-19 infections after suddenly ending its zero-COVID policy, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums. Epidemiologists estimate that over 60% of China's population and 10% of the world's population will be infected in the next 90 days. Crematoriums across China are reporting being overwhelmed with bodies and running out of space. Various estimates predict between 1.3 to 2.1 million deaths in China due to the COVID surge and insufficient healthcare capacity. Global officials are concerned about China's COVID surge potentially affecting the world economy, supply chains, and spawning new variants. China is reportedly reluctant to accept Western assistance due to political pride and nationalism.",
