    "full_text": "Innovative bus driver strike in Japan is not 'currently' happening\n\nWhat was claimed\nCurrently bus drivers in Japan are on strike, continuing to drive their routes while refusing to take fares from passengers.\n\nOur verdict\nAlthough bus drivers did take this industrial action in the Japanese city of Okayama during 2018, the protest has since ended.\n\nA post on Facebook which claims that bus drivers in Japan are currently carrying out a creative form of industrial action is misleading.\n\nThe post, shared on 8 August 2022, says: \"Currently bus drivers in Japan are on strike continuing to drive their routes while refusing to take fares from passengers! So keeping Japan on time, but costing the bus companies gas on top of lost revenue. Dear world, this is how a protest is done.\"\n\nThe claim does not specify where in Japan the strike took place and gives the impression that the action is ongoing.\n\nWhile it is true that drivers in the city of Okayama in western Japan did protest in this way, during the spring of 2018, there are no reports that suggest the strike is still ongoing and some sources say it ended during the middle of May that same year.\n\nAccording to reports published at the time, action began after drivers expressed concern that the launch of a rival bus company in the city might impact their job security.\n\nSimilar actions were taken by bus drivers in Brisbane, Australia, in the summer of 2017.\n\nFor the purposes of the fact-checking scheme, this claim has been rated as partly false because the industrial action by bus drivers in Okayama dates back to 2018 and ended in May that same year, so it is no longer ongoing.",

    "vclaim": "Bus drivers in Japan are claimed to be currently on strike by continuing to drive their routes while refusing to take fares from passengers. The bus driver strike actually occurred in Okayama, Japan in 2018 and ended in May of that year, not currently as claimed. The strike was initiated due to drivers' concerns about job security following the launch of a rival bus company.",
