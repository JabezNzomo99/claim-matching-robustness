    "full_text": "Fact Check: These Bangladeshi women forced to do sit-ups are NOT Hindus\n\nTwo videos were shared with a communal twist, falsely stating that they depict atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh.\n\nClaim:\nThese videos show Hindu women being harassed by Muslim mobs in Bangladesh.\n\nFact:\nBoth videos show Muslim Chhatra League members being harassed. These clips do not show the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh.\n\nDetailed Explanation:\n\nAs the political situation in Bangladesh continues to remain volatile, videos allegedly showing atrocities against Hindu women in the country have gone viral on social media.\n\nFirst Video:\nThe first video shows a woman dressed in black being confronted by a crowd. She was manhandled, made to do sit-ups, her face was covered with yellow powder, and she was pushed into a small body of water.\n\nUpon investigation, reverse-searching keyframes revealed that the woman was Afsana Ibad, a leader of the Chhatra League (the student wing of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party). An identity card from the Upazila Parishad elections confirmed her identity.\n\nSecond Video:\nThe second video shows a woman dressed in brown being made to do sit-ups by a mob. Social media posts claimed this was Jyotika Basu-Chatterjee, a humanitarian organization leader, and that she was targeted for being Hindu.\n\nHowever, further investigation showed this woman was Sagarika Akhter, a leader of Eden Women's College Chhatra League. A fact-checker provided her first-year admit card, which listed her name and \"freedom fighter\" quota.\n\nTanvir Mahatab Abir, a Dhaka-based fact-checker, asserted that neither video shows Hindu women being tortured. Instead, both depict anger against Chhatra League leaders who allegedly abused their power during Sheikh Hasina's regime.\n\nConclusion:\nBoth incidents were falsely given a communal spin. The videos do not show persecution of Hindus, but internal political conflicts involving Chhatra League members.",

The second video depicts Sagarika Akhter, an Eden Women's College Chhatra League leader, being made to do sit-ups, not a Hindu humanitarian organization leader named Jyotika Basu-Chatterjee. Both videos represent internal political conflicts involving Chhatra League members rather than religious persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh.",
