It has also given a concession in indexation so that Adani will get more value for the TDR generated from the Dharavi project,\" Thackeray said.\n\nHe made these allegations while speaking to the media after inaugurating his party's renovated office at Nariman Point.\n\nA significant amount of TDR will be generated in the Dharavi project and instead of selling it off, the government is letting a private company earn profit from it, Thackeray said. \"If the developer is going to earn such a huge profit, then why will the residents of Dharavi get small houses? The state government should take over the redevelopment project.\"\n\nThackeray claimed that 80,000-90,000 slum dwellers in Dharavi are not considered eligible for rehabilitation and asked the government whether they would be kicked out of the area.\n\nThe Sena (UBT) chief also alleged that the government is planning to hand over other redevelopment projects such as the government colony in Bandra, Abhyudaya Nagar in central Mumbai, and Adarsh Nagar to Adani Group. \"Are you going to hand over Mumbai to one person?\"\n\nReacting to the charges, BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye slammed Thackeray for taking an anti-development stand. \n\n\"Uddhav Thackeray and his party have a history of opposing development projects in the state and Mumbai. Earlier he opposed Metro 3 car depot, and the project was delayed. Now he is opposing the project which will give free homes to slum dwellers in Dharavi. The state government has given all the concessions as promised in the tender document,\" he said.\n\nCalls and messages to the CEO of Dharavi Redevelopment Authority and Adani Group spokesperson to get their reactions went unanswered.\n\nThackeray dared the Eknath Shinde-led government to conduct the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation poll. \"If they think there is a wave in favour of BJP, let the state government hold the civic poll in Mumbai.\"\n\nReferring to an editorial in his party's mouthpiece, Saamana, he raised doubts over the electronic voting machines and challenged the Central government to hold at least one election on ballot paper.",

    "vclaim": "Uddhav Thackeray alleges the state government is giving unfair concessions to Adani Group in the Dharavi redevelopment project, including mandatory 40% TDR purchase from them. Thackeray claims 80,000-90,000 Dharavi slum dwellers are deemed ineligible for rehabilitation under the project. The Shiv Sena (UBT) chief alleges the government plans to hand over additional redevelopment projects like Bandra government colony to Adani Group. BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye counters that Thackeray has a history of opposing development projects and all concessions were included in the tender document.
