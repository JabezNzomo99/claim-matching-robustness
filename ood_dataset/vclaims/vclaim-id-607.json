    "full_text": "There's no quota, but why is Bangladesh seeing fierce anti-quota revolt\n\nProtests by students against a 30% jobs quota have spread to almost the whole of Bangladesh. Security personnel have swarmed campuses and six protesters have been killed. Protesters have taken over university campuses. Such is the intensity of the protests that the government has been forced to shut down schools and colleges. What is the quota against which the students, who have no political allegiance, are revolting?\n\nExperts say the violence and deaths are unfortunate because the government is on the same page as the protesting students. They want this to be explained to the students immediately.  \n\nBangladesh watchers also believe that the protests aren't just about quotas, and the students are venting out their overall frustration. These protests, like most political issues in Bangladesh, have a 1971 link.    \n\nThe Liberation Movement of 1971 was the watershed moment in Bangladesh's history. Millions of people fought and Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan.    \n\nIn 1972, under then Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh introduced a quota system, reserving 30% of the seats for children of freedom fighters. The quota system reserved jobs for others too, while 44% of the jobs remained merit-based.\n\nIt is this 30% reservation in jobs that the students are protesting against. They are questioning why the third generation of freedom fighters should be given benefits, and demanding a total merit-based recruitment.\n\nInterestingly, after the Supreme Court suspended the High Court's order last week, Bangladesh has no quota currently.\n\nAll reservations in jobs, including the freedom fighters' quota, were scrapped by the Sheikh Hasina government in 2018 after a large-scale agitation by students.\n\nSince 2018, there was no quota until a group of petitioners went to the High Court in 2021 and fought a case to get back the 30% freedom fighters' reservation in civil services. \n\nAfter hearing the issue for three years, the high court reinstated the 30% quota on July 1. This triggered the recent protests.\n\nThe Attorney General approached the Supreme Court right after the High Court's decision. A petition was filed on July 16.\n\nThe Supreme Court had last week suspended the High Court's order for four weeks, according to reports. The Chief Justice asked protesting students to return to classes, saying the court would issue a decision in four weeks.\n\nDespite the Supreme Court's ruling and assurances by the chief justice, the protests continued.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's remarks, referring to Razakars in a bid to counter the protesters, added fuel to the agitation fire. \n\nClashes broke out Monday at Dhaka University, with more than 100 students injured, according to an Associated Press report. Overnight, violence spread to Jahangir Nagar University in Savar, outside Dhaka, and was reported elsewhere across Bangladesh on Tuesday.\n\nViolent protests spread to the southeastern city of Chattogram and the northern city of Rangpur.\n\nExperts also see popular frustration being vented out in the anti-quota agitation in Bangladesh.\n\nThe protests, which have largely been peaceful for two weeks, turned violent after the ruling party's Chhatra League and police came down heavily on the protestors.\n\nMore than just being about quotas, the anger and protests are about lack of employment opportunities. \"Amid the economy not doing well and news of high-profile corruption cases, more Bangladeshis are feeling deprived, and they feel only government jobs are the way to live a secured life.\"\n\n\"It is a protest by students staring at a bleak future without jobs,\" experts say.",

    "title": "Protests in Bangladesh against a 30% quota for grandchildren of freedom fighters in government jobs have spread across Bangladesh. The quota, scrapped by the Sheikh Hasina government in 2018, was reinstated by the high court on July 1 but suspended by the Supreme Court. Then why are students still revolting?",
    "vclaim": "Students in Bangladesh are protesting against a 30% job quota reserved for children of freedom fighters, demanding merit-based recruitment instead. The Bangladesh government had scrapped all job quotas in 2018 following student protests, but the High Court reinstated the 30% freedom fighters' quota in July 2023. The Supreme Court suspended the High Court's quota reinstatement order for four weeks, but protests continued despite this ruling. The initially peaceful protests turned violent after confrontations with the ruling party's Chhatra League and police, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. The protests reflect broader frustrations about unemployment and economic conditions in Bangladesh, beyond just the quota issue.",
