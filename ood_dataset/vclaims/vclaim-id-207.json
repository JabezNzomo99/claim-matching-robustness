Here's A Fact-Check Of Viral Whatsapp Forward\n\nA Whatsapp forward claiming that the US government has decided that its currency notes printed before 2021 will no longer be valid from January 2023 has gone viral. According to the forward, which was received on their Whatsapp tipline, the demonetisation move was taken during a meeting between \"United States Federal Reserve Bank, Office of the Comptroller of Currency, IMF, World-Bank and Governors of Africa's Central Banks\".\n\nThe rationale behind this decision, the text stated, was to \"curb billions of illegal monies in dollar bills warehoused around the African continent emanating from drug related, terrorism, kidnapping and money from corrupt politicians.\"\n\nHere's how the message reads:\n\nDEMONETIZATION NOW BY USA\u2026\u2026\u2026..Any US Dollar Notes Below Year 2021 Will Not Be Acceptable From January 2023 \u2013 US Govt\n\nSequel to the just concluded extraordinary meeting held in Washington DC on Nov. 2nd 2022 between the United States Federal Reserve Bank, Office of the Comptroller of Currency, IMF, World-Bank and Governors of Africa's Central Banks, the United States Govt has set date for restriction on acceptable legal tender note of US Dollar which will commence on Jan. 31st 2023.\n\nThe restriction implies that any US Dollar note below 2021 printed date will no longer be accepted or be a legal tender anywhere in the world\u2026 This effort is to curb billions of illegal monies in dollar bills warehoused around African continent emanating from drug related, terrorism, kidnapping and money from corrupt politicians.\n\nAs part of the enforcement of the strict action plan, African central banks will be assigned with a special agent from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, Administrator of National bank United States of America to checkmate all inflows and outflows of dollar transactions.\n\nThe report also has it that US president has also written to British Government and European Union to tour same line and redesign their currencies accordingly to frustrate those with ill-gotten money in US dollar, British Pound Sterling and Euros.\n\nLessons learnt from India\ud83d\ude1d\nhttps://observerstimes.com/2022/11/05/any-us-dollar-notes-below-year-2021-will-not-be-acceptable-from-january-2023-us-govt/\n\nFact check\n\nNewschecker first ran keyword searches for \"US note ban\", \"US demonetisation\", which did not throw up any official reports of such a decision by the US government.\n\nThey then ran a search to see if there was any news outlet by the name \"Observer Times\", which also did not show any relevant results of such a report. However, they noticed the masthead of the news report, which shows one Usman Okai Austin in the manner of a poll campaign. A quick search for the individual led them to multiple write-ups, seen in various sources, from which they learnt that the report was based out of Nigeria.\n\nThey then learnt, via a keyword search for \"Nigeria demonetisation\", that the country had recently announced its plan to redesign the country's highest paper denominations \u2013 the 200-, 500- and 1,000-naira notes. \"Nigeria's currency, the naira, has dropped to a record low against the US dollar as Nigerians scramble to buy US currency ahead of a redesign of naira notes. Nigerian authorities say replacing the notes will reduce inflation, combat counterfeiting and bring more money into circulation,\" read a news report, adding that the new naira notes will begin circulating in mid-December, and the old notes will cease to be legal tender by the end of January. This was the same timeline indicated in the Whatsapp forward, raising their doubts.\n\nNext, they went to the official website of the US department of treasury, where they did not find any such announcement of scrapping currency notes.\n\nFrom this site, they were led to the US Currency Education Program (CEP), which is responsible for ensuring that users of US currency around the world have access to education, training, and information about Federal Reserve notes.\n\nAccording to the \"History of US Currency\" section of the site, the latest note to be redesigned by the US dates back to 2013 \u2014 the redesigned $100 note, proving that there has been no recent move towards printing new notes.\n\nAlso, the CEP states that \"it is U.S. government policy that all designs of Federal Reserve notes remain legal tender, or legally valid for payments, regardless of when they were issued,\" thus confirming that the viral forward is fake.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe viral claim that the US has implemented a note ban, rendering all dollar bills printed before 2021 as illegal after January 2023, was found to be false.\n\nResult: False",

    "title": "The claim that the US government has decided to ban the use of currency notes printed before 2021 is incorrect.

    "vclaim": "A viral WhatsApp message claims that US dollar notes printed before 2021 will become invalid from January 2023. The message claims this decision was made during a meeting between US Federal Reserve Bank, IMF, World Bank, and African Central Bank governors to curb illegal money from drugs, terrorism, and corruption. The viral message falsely connects this alleged US demonetization to Nigeria's actual currency redesign of its naira notes. The US Treasury and Currency Education Program confirm that all US Federal Reserve notes remain legal tender regardless of when they were issued.",
