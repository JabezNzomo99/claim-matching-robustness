    "full_text": "How to Spot a Job Scam: A Case Study of the Mara Resort and Aero Cargo Job Hoaxes\n\nDesperate to make ends meet, many unsuspecting job seekers are becoming victims of scam traps. For the past one and a half years, job seekers in the hotel and cargo sectors in Kenya have fallen prey to scammers who purposely target these sectors by purporting to offer opportunities.\n\nThese con artists exploit the fact that in Africa, the growth rate of available job opportunities is much slower compared to population growth. Scammers use various tricks such as creating job advertisements on websites, issuing fake appointment letters, and inviting \"appointees\" to report for work.\n\nPesaCheck has identified several methods to help job seekers identify potential job scams:\n\n1. Social Media Presence\n- Check the Facebook page transparency\n- Look for multiple name changes\n- Verify the page's original username and creation date\n\n2. Website Verification\n- Check if the organization's website is accessible\n- Look for broken links or sites perpetually \"under maintenance\"\n- Verify the website's URL matches the company name\n- Check for image inconsistencies or stolen images\n\n3. Payment Requests\n- Be wary of any job that requires you to pay a fee\n- Legitimate institutions do not ask for payment to secure employment\n- Verify certificate fees through official county government portals\n\n4. Company Existence\n- Use Google Maps to verify the company's physical location\n- Check the Business Registration Service (BRS) to confirm company registration\n- Contact local county government to verify business licensing\n\n5. Phone Number Verification\n- Check if phone numbers are consistent across different job advertisements\n- Use Truecaller to verify contact details\n- Be suspicious of repeated phone number usage across multiple scam job ads\n\n6. Interview Process\n- Legitimate jobs typically involve a proper interview process\n- Be cautious of jobs that promise automatic qualification\n- Beware of offers that seem too good to be true\n\n7. Appointment Letter\n- Check for template similarities across different job scams\n- Look for consistent formatting and design elements\n- Verify HR manager details and company logos\n\n8. Social Media Reviews\n- Search for public comments and experiences\n- Look for complaints about scams or payment requests\n\n9. Fact-Checking\n- Search online to see if the job has been previously debunked\n- Use fact-checking websites like PesaCheck\n\n10. Submit for Verification\n- If unsure, submit the job advertisement to fact-checking organizations for verification\n\nFinal advice: Always be cautious, thoroughly research job opportunities, and never pay for a job. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
