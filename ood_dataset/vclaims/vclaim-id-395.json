    "full_text": "BJP Launches 'Free Recharge Yojana' For 2024 Polls? No Such Scheme\n\nClaim:\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is offering \"three months free recharge\" so that more people can vote for BJP in the 2024 general elections.\n\nFact:\nWe started by inspecting the link provided in the Whatsapp forward, which brought us to a website, stating \"BJP Free Recharge Yojana\", and another link, \"Get Free Recharge\", that asks us for our number.\n\nThe URL, https://www.bjp.org@bjp2024.mangafinic.com/, raised our doubts as the BJP's official website address reads, https://www.bjp.org/.\n\nWe next ran a keyword search for \"BJP free recharge yojana\", which did not lead us to any credible news reports or official statements of such a scheme. We looked up the BJP's official website for the scheme, which, again, did not throw up any relevant results.\n\nNewschecker learnt that the \"mangafinic.com\" website was found to be suspicious and marked \"Doubtful. Medium-Risk. Alert\" by Scam Detector, a major fraud prevention resource.\n\n\"The first one [parameter] that we look at is the 'Proximity to suspicious websites' tab. What does that mean exactly? It means that, unfortunately, through either its servers, IP address or other online connections, mangafinic.com has an association \u2013 on a range from 1 to 100 \u2013 to sites that have been flagged as malicious. The higher the number is, the higher the proximity to these controversial websites is \u2013 so, the higher, the worse,\" read the scam detector's review.\n\nWe have reached out to cybersecurity experts and will update this article once we receive a response.\n\nResult: False\n\nSources:\nAnalysis\nScam detector review",
