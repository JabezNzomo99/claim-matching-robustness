    "full_text": "Govt releases 9-yr space report card: 389 foreign sats launched, Rs 3,300 cr earned, 123% rise in budget\n\nBENGALURU: Buoyed by the success of various space programmes, increasing space activities in the country and Chandrayaan-3 mission, the Modi government on Wednesday released a series of posts unveiling its report card on the country's achievements in the fast-growing space sector.\n\nIn a series of posts on microblogging site X, the government showcased \"India's stellar decade in space\" as, it said, Isro launched an impressive 389 out of 424 foreign satellites in nine years of the NDA government. \"A testament to our prowess in space innovation!,\" it said, adding, \"Before 2014, only 35 foreign satellites were launched\".\n\nWith the \"voyage of profits via space ventures\", the country earned over Rs 3,300 crore by launching 389 foreign satellites in the last nine years. India also made a world record of launching 104 satellites on board PSLV-C3 on February 15, 2017. Of the 104 satellites, 101 belonged to international customers.\n\nIndia's space sector budget soared from Rs 5,615 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 12,543 crore in 10 years, a rise of 123%, it said. With increased satellite launches, Isro's launch rate also jumped from 1.2 yearly launch missions before 2014 to an impressive 5.7 satellites since 2014.\n\nThe government also laid emphasis on nurturing future space innovators as Isro's tally for launching student satellites went from four before 2014 to 11 since 2014. The aim was to \"ignite young minds and propel them towards the cosmos\", the post said.\n\nThough the Chandrayaan-2 lander crashlanded, its orbiter has turned out to be a \"beacon of knowledge\" as it illuminated the universe with tonnes of data on the Moon, inspiring researchers worldwide. With eight advanced scientific instruments on board, Chandrayaan-2 orbiter has been sending valuable scientific findings from the Moon, significant among them being clear evidence of the presence of water molecules (H2O) and hydroxyl (OH) on the lunar surface, for the research community since 2019.\n\nTo empower young innovators, Isro through its new mini-PSLV called Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV-D2) launched three student-built satellites \u2013 EOS-07, AzaadiSAT-2 and Janus-1. AzaadiSAT-2 integration was the collaborative brilliance of 750 girl students, guided by Space Kidz.\n\nThe government said it broke several barriers by unlocking the space sector in 2020, giving private entities smooth access to Isro technologies and facilities. The best example of it was on November 25, 2022, when history was made with the establishment of the first private launchpad and mission control centre (in Sriharikota), the post said. \"Around 140 start-ups illuminated during India's Space Horizon since 2020 as (newly-formed space regulator) IN-SPACe created an ecosystem of industry, academia & innovation, rewriting the narrative of space exploration,\" it said.\n\nIndia also joined hands with several countries for trailblazing partnerships in space over these nine years. Significant among them is India signing the Nasa-led Artemis Accord during PM Modi's visit to the US this year. The accord objective is a peaceful Moon exploration and that data from Chandrayaan-3 could support Artemis human landings, the government said. The Rs 470-crore Indo-US joint satellite project, NISAR, is the first joint hardware development between two agencies for an Earth-observing mission.",

    "title": "Chandrayaan 1 landed successfully on Jawahar Point on the South Pole of the Moon and sent data back to earth (which included the fabulous possibility of the presence of Lunar Water) for ten months and six days instead of the planned two years,  but was successful by achieving 95% of its planned objectives. Thus the mission was not a failure. The figures given regarding the budget allocation is not correct. India's space sector budget soared from Rs 5,615 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 12,543 crore in 10 years. The number of total of 424 foreign satellites were sent to space by ISRO, out of which 390 were sent in the 9yrs period.",
    "vclaim": "India launched 389 foreign satellites in the last nine years compared to only 35 before 2014. India earned over Rs 3,300 crore from launching foreign satellites in the past nine years. India's space sector budget increased by 123% from Rs 5,615 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 12,543 crore in 10 years. ISRO's yearly launch rate increased from 1.2 missions before 2014 to 5.7 satellites since 2014. ISRO's student satellite launches increased from 4 before 2014 to 11 since 2014. Chandrayaan-2's orbiter has provided valuable scientific data including evidence of water molecules on the lunar surface. The government opened up the space sector to private entities in 2020, leading to the establishment of the first private launchpad and mission control centre. Around 140 space start-ups have emerged in India since 2020 following the creation of IN-SPACe. India signed the NASA-led Artemis Accord and initiated a Rs 470-crore joint satellite project NISAR with the US.",
