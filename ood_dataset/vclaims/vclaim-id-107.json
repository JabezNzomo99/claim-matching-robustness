    "full_text": "No, 34 Countries Didn't Support Nupur Sharma Over Her Prophet Muhammad Remark\n\nA social media post which claims that 34 countries, including Russia, Netherlands, France, and Israel showed support for India and suspended Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nupur Sharma after her inflammatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad is being widely shared on social media.\n\nThe claim comes after Sharma and the BJP drew international criticism for her controversial remarks against the Islamic Prophet on a television debate.\n\nHowever, this is false. We found no mention of any of the countries named as supporting the former spokesperson, or India, in news reports, or in verified social media accounts of foreign ministries of the countries over the recent controversy.\n\nCLAIM\nThe post is being shared with text in Hindi, which translates to:\n\"34 countries including Russia, Netherlands, France and Israel showed their support for India and Nupur Sharma. Jai Shri Ram.\"\n\nArchives of more posts with the same claim can be seen here, here, and here.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND OUT\nUsing relevant keywords, we looked for reports of any countries issuing statements of support over the Nupur Sharma-Prophet Muhammed remarks controversy, but came across news reports of countries and bodies criticising the suspended BJP spokesperson.\n\nThere was only one report by Times of India, discussing Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders, known for his far-right views, supporting Sharma.\n\nOn his verified Twitter account, Wilders has shared multiple tweets supporting Sharma and questioning the protests and action taken against her.\n\nNext, we checked the websites of the Russian embassy, the French embassy, the Israeli embassy and the Dutch embassy, but did not find any statement of support or solidarity with India or Nupur Sharma.\n\nWe also checked the foreign ministry accounts of each of the countries, where there was no mention of Sharma.\n\nWe have reached out the embassies of these countries and the story will be updated if and when we receive a response.\n\nEvidently, the claim that 34 countries came out in support of India and Nupur Sharma after she made inflammatory remarks regarding Prophet Muhammad on a television debate is false.",

    "vclaim": "A viral social media post falsely claimed that 34 countries, including Russia, Netherlands, France, and Israel, supported India and Nupur Sharma following her controversial remarks about Prophet Muhammad. Only Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders, known for his far-right views, publicly supported Sharma, while no official support was found from any of the mentioned countries. Instead of support, Sharma and BJP faced international criticism for her inflammatory remarks against the Islamic Prophet.",
