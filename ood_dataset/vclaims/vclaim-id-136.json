    "full_text": "Fact Check: Viral video of Japan's lightning-fast electric train is not real\n\nA video of a train ride is being shared on social media along with the claim that the new electric train in Japan is twice as fast as an F-16 fighter aircraft. \n\nClaim:\nThis video claims the new electric train in Japan runs at 4,800 km/h. It allegedly completed the 515-km journey from Osaka to Tokyo in just 10 minutes, making it four times faster than an aircraft.\n\nFact:\nThis is a time-lapse video of a high-speed bullet train journey from Osaka to Tokyo. The actual journey normally takes 2.5 hours.\n\nDetails:\n- The video was created by \"Fermata Studio\", a YouTube channel that makes simulation and time-lapse videos of trains and aircraft.\n- The original video was titled \"[High-Speed Simulation] Operating Shinkansen Bullet Train, Osaka to Tokyo (515km) in 10 min\".\n- The YouTuber explicitly stated in the video description: \"This movie is a fiction. Normally it takes 2.5 hours from Shin-Osaka to Tokyo. Made by a method called 'Time variant hyper-lapse/time-lapse'.\"\n\nAccording to news reports, Japan's fastest bullet trains can reach speeds up to 400 km/h, not 4,800 km/h as claimed in the viral video.\n\nThe creator confirmed to AFP Fact Check that the video was intentionally made as a science fiction creation to allow people to experience \"extreme speed that is impossible in reality.\"\n\nConclusion: The viral video is a fabricated time-lapse simulation, not a real train journey. The speed and travel time claims are completely false.",

The video is actually a time-lapse simulation created by Fermata Studio, while real Japanese bullet trains can only reach speeds up to 400 km/h. The actual journey from Osaka to Tokyo by bullet train takes 2.5 hours, not 10 minutes as suggested in the viral video.",
