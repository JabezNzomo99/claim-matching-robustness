    "full_text": "In the context of the ongoing riots in France over the shooting of a youngster by a policeman for a traffic violation, a post is being shared on social media claiming that France has banned entry for citizens from 57 Muslim countries but only allows Indian citizens. Let's verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: France has implemented a ban on citizens from 57 Muslim countries while exclusively permitting entry for Indian citizens in response to the recent riots.\n\nFact: There is no official statement or media reports regarding France implementing a ban on citizens from 57 Muslim countries. The visa application process for all countries on France's official visa website appears to be normal without any restrictions. Therefore, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nFirst, we checked the official website for visas in France to see if there is any announcement of a ban on entry for citizens from specific countries, but we could not find any information regarding this matter. Additionally, we explored the websites of several Middle Eastern country embassies in France, and there is no mention of France implementing a visa ban for their nationals.\n\nFurthermore, there are no credible media reports suggesting that France is considering imposing a ban on the entry of citizens from Muslim nations. The visa application process for all countries on France's official visa website appears to be normal without any restrictions.\n\nHowever, amidst the recent visit of the Indian Prime Minister Modi to France on 14 July 2023, there are unsubstantiated reports claiming that Pakistani journalists stated Pakistani citizens were banned from entering France, although no official announcement has been made. We have contacted French authorities for clarification on this matter. This article will be updated accordingly if and when additional information becomes available.\n\nTo sum it up, there is no evidence to suggest that France has implemented a ban on citizens from 57 Muslim countries.",
