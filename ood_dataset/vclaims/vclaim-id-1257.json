    "full_text": "SCAM: This website claiming that there are jobs at Mara Resort is a hoax\n\nPesaCheck's research shows there is no such hotel at the Maasai Mara National Reserve.\n\nA website article advertising job vacancies at Mara Resort, located within the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Narok County, is a SCAM.\n\nThe job advert, shared on a Facebook page, claims they seek to recruit front desk staff, waiters/waitresses, room attendants, chef/kitchen staff and cleaners.\n\nThe net salaries for the available positions range from Ksh20,015 to Ksh38,455. This remuneration will, from February 2022, be revised upwards and company benefits such as leave allowance and company loans included, according to the post.\n\nTo qualify for the jobs, one must be a Kenyan citizen with at least a high school education \u2014 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE). The candidate's attitude must be good, with excellent written and verbal communication skills. The candidate should be friendly with an engaging personality and have integrity. One must also have excellent customer service, time management skills, and attention to detail.\n\n\"These positions are not open to those currently battling infectious airborne diseases e.g. TB,\" the job advert states.\n\nIt is not necessary to have prior experience in the hospitality industry. The two-year contract jobs will be available in shifts, day or night for nine hours each, six days a week.\n\nInterested applicants are advised to share a handwritten or typed CV, a copy of their KCSE results slip or certificate and a copy of their national identity card or waiting card. A candidate is required to either email their application or send it to a post office box provided in the advert. The application deadline is 18 December 2021.\n\nAfter performing a reverse image search, PesaCheck discovered that the images used on the website are stolen from other locations:\n\n- The infinity pool image is from Welgevonden Private Game Reserve in Limpopo, South Africa\n- The accommodation section image is from Tongabezi & Sindabezi in Livingstone, Zambia\n- The contacts section image is of wildebeest and zebras migrating at the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania\n\nMara Resort is not listed among the camps and lodges at the Maasai Mara National Reserve.\n\nAnother red flag is that the job advert on Mara Resort's Facebook page has a link that reads \"Jobs \u2014 Mara Villanzia\". However, the URL is \"mararesorts.co.ke\". This means that initially when the Facebook post was first published, the website belonged to Mara Villanzia.\n\nAccording to the page transparency information of the Mara Resort's Facebook page, it was created on 16 November 2021 with the name Mara Villanzia Resort. However, on 1 December 2021, the page changed its name to \"Mara Resorts\".\n\nPesaCheck contacted Paul Tobiko, the director of communications at Narok County government, who confirmed that the two resorts are non-existent.\n\n\"There are no such resorts at the Maasai Mara,\" Tobiko told PesaCheck.\n\nTobiko added that there had been a rise of job scams claiming to be located at the Maasai Mara National Reserve, asking job applicants to pay a fee of up to Ksh2,500 for the health and food handling certificate. He advised job applicants not to pay any money for a job as that is the first indication that a job is not legitimate.",

    "vclaim": "A website is falsely advertising job vacancies at a non-existent Mara Resort in the Maasai Mara National Reserve. The scam website uses stolen images from other locations in South Africa, Zambia, and Tanzania to appear legitimate. The Facebook page behind the scam changed its name from \"Mara Villanzia Resort\" to \"Mara Resorts\" in December 2021. Narok County government's director of communications confirmed that both Mara Resort and Mara Villanzia Resort do not exist. There has been an increase in job scams related to the Maasai Mara National Reserve that request applicants to pay fees for certificates.",
