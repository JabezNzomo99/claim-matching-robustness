    "full_text": "Viral Claim About Karnataka Burqa-Clad Girl Muskan's Death Is Hoax!\n\nSpeaking to The Quint, Muskan said that she is absolutely fine and is now in Saudi Arabia.\n\nA photo which shows a man carrying an unconscious girl wearing a hijab (face veil) is being shared on social media identifying the girl as Muskan, the burqa-clad girl in Mandya, Karnataka, who stood up to a group of saffron-clad boys chanting 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans in February 2022.\n\nThe claim along with the photo goes on to state that 'she is no more'.\n\nHowever, neither is the news true nor is the photo of Muskan.\n\n- The photograph is from a protest that happened in Kashmir in April 2017 and the girl in the photo fell unconscious during the clashes near Women's College, MA Road, in Srinagar. This was confirmed by Umar Ganie, the photojournalist who took the picture.\n\n- We also contacted Muskan, who told us that she is doing fine and is in Saudi Arabia with her family.\n\nEver since the incident, Muskan has been targeted with misinformation at several occasions.\n\nCLAIM\nOne of the captions with the viral post in Bengali states that Muskan, who stood up against those boys in Mandya, has been killed.\n\nSeveral short videos are also being shared online with the same claim. The videos show a picture of Muskan from February 2022 and this picture which shows a man carrying a girl.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND OUT\nOn conducting a reverse image search on the photo, we came across an article published on Mid-Day in April 2017. The article titled \"When the girls come out pelting in Kashmir\" mentioned that students from Women's College, MA Road, staged protests and pelted stones at the security forces.\n\nAnother article on Rediff.com from 17 April 2017 carried the same picture with a caption and mentioned the photo credit as 'Umar Ganie'.\n\nWe reached out to Ganie, who is a photojournalist with news agency PTI, and he corroborated that the picture was taken by him on 17 April 2017.\n\n\"The picture shows an injured college girl, who was being shifted to hospital through a footbridge, after she fell unconscious due to tear gas shelling.\" - Umar Ganie, Photojournalist\n\n'CLAIMS ARE FAKE, I AM FINE': MUSKAN\nThe Quint also got in touch with Muskan, who rubbished these rumours and said that she is absolutely fine.\n\n\"I am fine and all these claims are fake. I am currently in Saudi Arabia for a religious trip with my family.\" - Muskan Khan\n\nShe also added that she is pursuing her Bachelors of Commerce (BCom) in Karnataka.\n\nEvidently, an unrelated and an old photo was linked to Muskan to push a false claim.",

    "vclaim": "A viral photo claiming to show the death of Muskan, a burqa-clad girl from Karnataka who confronted saffron-clad protesters in 2022, is false and actually shows a different incident from Kashmir in 2017. Muskan confirmed she is alive and well, currently in Saudi Arabia with her family, and pursuing her BCom degree in Karnataka. The viral photo actually shows an unconscious college girl being carried during protests near Women's College in Srinagar in April 2017, as confirmed by photographer Umar Ganie.",
