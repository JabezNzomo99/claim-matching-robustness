    "full_text": "From Facebook pages to Google forms: How to spot a lending scam\n\nUnscrupulous individuals running dubious digital lending platforms con thousands of unsuspecting Kenyans every day.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the finances of many Kenyans, hitting the majority of low-income earners especially hard. Many are turning to digital money lenders to bail them out when finances are constrained.\n\nThe demand for mobile loans has given rise to a fast-growing and lucrative digital lending space that has proved to be both a boon and bane for an estimated six million digital borrowers.\n\nBoon, because it serves as a stitch in time for those struggling to fend for themselves during these hard economic times, as digital lenders often process short-term loans within minutes or even seconds.\n\nTelecom firm Safaricom, for example, in its 2020 Sustainability Business Report, said it processes about six transactions every second on its mobile money overdraft facility, 'Fuliza', with the total amount of loans disbursed topping KSh 245 billion in just one year.\n\nConversely, the digital lending space in Kenya remains largely unregulated, and dubious companies, out to defraud prospective borrowers, have cropped up, posing as bonafide lenders.\n\nPesaCheck's investigations over recent weeks uncovered a number of dubious companies; some mimicking the identities of legitimate digital lending firms, or posing as legitimate government initiatives known for economically empowering citizens, making it increasingly difficult for consumers to tell them apart.\n\nThe article provides several examples of such scams, including Facebook pages falsely representing PesaPap (a Family Bank digital application) and Uwezo Fund, and identifying fake lending companies like 254WEZA LOANS, Jikwamue Loans, Mwananchi Loans, and Waraka LoansKE.\n\nKey warning signs of digital lending scams include:\n\n1. Requiring payment of a registration fee before loan processing\n2. Using Google forms for loan applications\n3. Displaying non-existent contact information\n4. Mimicking legitimate lender branding\n5. Not being listed with the Digital Lenders Association of Kenya (DLAK)\n\nRecommendations for avoiding lending scams:\n- Always verify the legitimacy of digital lenders\n- Check the lender's registration on e-Citizen\n- Be wary of pages asking for upfront fees\n- Verify social media page authenticity\n- Use only official websites for loan applications\n- Check DLAK's membership list\n\nThe article emphasizes the importance of being cautious in the unregulated digital lending space, particularly during economic hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "vclaim": "Digital lending scams in Kenya have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with fraudsters targeting vulnerable borrowers through fake lending platforms. Scammers create counterfeit Facebook pages and Google forms mimicking legitimate financial institutions like PesaPap and Uwezo Fund to deceive potential borrowers. Common red flags of digital lending scams include demanding upfront registration fees, using Google forms for applications, displaying fake contact information, and copying legitimate lender branding. Legitimate digital lending services like Safaricom's Fuliza process millions of loans, demonstrating the high demand for mobile lending in Kenya. Kenya's digital lending space remains largely unregulated, making it easier for fraudulent companies to operate alongside legitimate lenders.",
