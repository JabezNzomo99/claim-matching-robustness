The content contains a list of fact-check headlines and thumbnail images, but does not include the full text of any individual fact-check investigation.\n\nTo process a specific fact-check article, I would need the full HTML content of the individual story page. The current HTML is a homepage or listing view of various fact-check stories from what seems to be the India Today fact-check section.\n\nIf you would like me to extract the text content, you would need to provide the HTML for a specific fact-check article's full page.",
