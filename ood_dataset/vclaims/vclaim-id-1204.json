    "full_text": "Fact-Check: No, BJP Hasn't Launched a Phone Number To Show Support for UCC\n\nA post is doing the rounds on social media platforms stating that people need to give a missed call on a phone number (9090902024) to express their support for the Uniform Civil Code (UCC).\n\nThe claim further stated that:\n- Four crore Muslims and two crore Christians have already voted against UCC\n- It urged Hindus to support the UCC by giving a missed call\n\nWhat is the truth?:\nThe phone number has no relation to the UCC and no such announcement has been made. The number was released by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as part of their 'Jan Sampark Se Jan Samarthan' campaign in the run up to the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections.\n\nHow did we find that out?:\n- A Google search revealed a post on the official X handle of BJP\n- The post was uploaded on 29 June 2023 with a caption in Hindi: \"9 years...of service, good governance and poor welfare! To join the 'Jan Sampark Se Jan Samarthan' campaign, give a missed call to 9090902024.\"\n- When a missed call was given, a message was received saying: \"Thank you for supporting the Modi Government. Click the link to learn more about the Central Government's achievements.\"\n\nNews reports:\n- India Today reported that BJP launched a unique 'missed call campaign' with the number 9090902024 ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections\n- The number represented the nine years of the government and the upcoming elections in 2024\n\nLaw Commission's notification:\n- A disclaimer was issued cautioning people against fraudulent WhatsApp texts, messages, and calls about UCC\n- The commission clarified that it communicates only through official channels\n\nConclusion:\nA fake post is being shared online requesting people to give a missed call on a number to express their support for the Uniform Civil Code.",
