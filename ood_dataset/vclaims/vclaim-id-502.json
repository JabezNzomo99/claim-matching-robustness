    "full_text": "Claim: Supreme Court of India has banned the usage of electronic voting machines (EVMs).\n\nFact: There are no reports indicating that the Supreme Court of India has banned the usage of electronic voting machines (EVMs). If the Supreme Court had indeed made such a decision, it would have been widely reported. A fact-check by PIB (Press Information Bureau of the Government of India) on 15 February 2024, also refuted a similar claim suggesting that EVMs were banned by the Supreme Court of India. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nTo check the veracity of the viral claim, a relevant keyword search was conducted on the internet. No reports were found stating that the Supreme Court of India has banned the usage of electronic voting machines (EVMs). An X(Twitter) post by PIB Fact Check on 15 February 2024 refuted a similar claim that EVMs were banned by the Supreme Court of India.\n\nMultiple reports were found about the Supreme Court of India dismissing several PILs filed against the usage of EVMs. In November 2019, the Supreme Court rejected a petition to use ballot paper in place of EVMs in the Lok Sabha elections. The court stated that no system is perfect. The PIL was filed by A Subba Rao on behalf of the NGO Nyaya Bhoomi, arguing that EVMs can be misused and should not be used during elections.\n\nIn September 2022, a Supreme Court bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and Hima Kohli refused to entertain a petition seeking to stop the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and revert to ballot papers in elections.\n\nIn the viral video, the individuals were discussing the Supreme Court's decision on electoral bonds. A review of the Supreme Court's decision revealed no mention of a ban on EVMs or their use. An extended version of the video showed the speaker expressing opposition to EVMs, stating they violate the Constitution and urging people to unite against them.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that the individuals are lawyers who have been campaigning against EVMs for an extended period. They have formed an organization called \"EVM Hatao Sanyukt Morcha\" to protest against the use of EVMs. The person speaking in the viral video is Mahmood Pracha.\n\nTo sum up, the Supreme Court of India did not ban the usage of electronic voting machines (EVMs).",
