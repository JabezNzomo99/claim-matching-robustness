    "full_text": "Viral Post Claiming India 'Bought' 28 Islands From Maldives Is False\n\nClaim: India bought 28 islands from Maldives.\n\nFact: No evidence of such a purchase. Inauguration of Indian-funded projects in 28 Maldivian islands has been misconstrued.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar recently concluded a three-day visit to Maldives, marking the first high-level trip from New Delhi since the political row between the two nations, and Mohamed Muizzu, considered to be pro-China, assumed the Maldivian President's office.\n\nIn this backdrop, several social media users, including verified handles, claimed that India has \"bought\" 28 islands from the archipelagic state. Newschecker, however, found the claim to be untrue.\n\nMultiple X and Facebook users claimed, \"India bought 28 islands from Maldives. Maldives handover its 28 Islands to India. President Muizzu himself signed the agreement.\" Calling it \"The magic of 50 metres walk on Lakshadweep beach and one tweet,\" referring to the Prime Minister's visit to a beach on Indian island earlier this year.\n\nFact Check/Verification:\n\nA keyword search for \"India,\" \"28 islands\" and \"Maldives\" on Google did not yield any credible report stating that the Modi government has \"bought\" any territory from the archipelagic country.\n\nIt, however, threw up multiple reports about the inauguration of India funded water and sanitation project in Maldives. One such report by PTI, dated August 10, 2024, stated, \"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday handed over to the Maldives a massive water and sanitation project worth approximately Rs 923 crore (USD 110 million) funding from India at 28 islands covering seven per cent of the population of the archipelagic nation.\"\n\n\"The Water and Sanitation Projects on 28 islands, commissioned under the Indian Line of Credit Facility by the Exim Bank of India, were described by Jaishankar as the 'largest climate adaptation implemented in the Maldives with international collaboration,'\" it added.\n\nA press release by the Ministry of External Affairs on Jaishankar's recent visit to Maldives also stated, \"At the President's Office, EAM and Foreign Minister jointly inaugurated, in the presence of President Muizzu, India's Line of Credit (LoC)-assisted project of water and sewerage network in 28 islands of Maldives.\"\n\nA release by the Maldivian President's office regarding the same further listed the names of all the 28 facilities that were handed over during the event. These include Ha. Kelaa Water Supply facilities, Sh. Funadhoo Water Supply facilities, N. Manadhoo Water Supply facilities, AA. Thoddoo Sewerage facilities among others.\n\nConclusion:\nHence, the inauguration of India-funded water and sanitation projects in Maldives has been misconstrued as the Modi government buying 28 islands from the archipelago.\n\nResult: False",
