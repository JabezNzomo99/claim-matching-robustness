    "full_text": "FIT WebQoof: Microwaves Ain't Harmful & Japan Isn't Banning Them\n\nThe news around health and microwaves is as old as microwaves themselves. The latest making rounds in the social media is about Japan banning microwaves completely.\n\nThe Claim\n\nIn the claim we received on mail, it reads, \"The Japanese government decided to dispose of all microwave ovens in the country before the end of this year. All citizens and organizations that do not fulfill the requirement are threatened with prison sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years, depending on the severity of the crime.\n\nThe reason for the ban on microwaves in the Land of the Rising Sun was research by scientists from the University of Hiroshima, who found out that radioactive waves caused more harm to the health of citizens over the 20 years of use of the microwave oven than the nuclear bombing of American aircraft in September 1945.\n\nAccording to the findings of experts, food, heated in a microwave oven, has unfavourable vibrations, in disharmony with the universal rhythms.\n\nAll the largest manufacturers of microwave ovens in Japan have already closed factory workshops where products were manufactured. In 2021, the termination of the production of microwave ovens will be announced in South Korea, China plans to abandon this type of technology in 2023.\" (sic)\n\nTrue or False?\n\nFALSE: If the idea of a microwave ban in Japan hassles you, you can breathe easy because it's not true at all. Apparently, the source of the fake news was a Russian satirical website. Another fact checking site has also found the claims to be completely false.\n\nAccording to a report by Harvard Medical School, there really is no proven connection between cancer and microwaves. On the contrary, in some ways, microwaves actually help with locking in the nutrients of the food which might get lost in traditional ways of cooking.\n\nSince microwaves require less cooking time, food nutrients like Vitamin C, which break down due to exposure to heat, are preserved while the preparation of the food. Additionally, cooking vegetables in water also diminishes their nutritional value as the cooking water leaches out the nutrients. Since microwaves require very little amount of water for cooking, they further keep the nutrients intact.\n\nWhile some nutrients of food items are lost in all forms of cooking, microwave does remain one of the healthier ways of doing it, since it keeps the vitamins and minerals preserved. It also prevents the formation of harmful compounds in many food items.\n\nHowever some basic guidelines need to be kept in mind while using microwaves. These include not using plastic containers and to ensure that the food is evenly heated.",

    "vclaim": "A viral claim states that Japan is banning all microwave ovens and threatening citizens with prison sentences for non-compliance. The claim suggests that Japanese scientists found microwave radiation more harmful than the 1945 nuclear bombing. The viral message claims that major Japanese microwave manufacturers have closed their factories, with South Korea and China planning to follow suit. According to Harvard Medical School, there is no proven connection between cancer and microwaves, and microwave cooking can actually help preserve nutrients in food.",
