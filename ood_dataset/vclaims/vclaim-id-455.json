But its last breaths were not taken in an isolated corner of American geography. It succumbed to a long-dreaded disease in the backcountry of Yellowstone national park, north-west Wyoming \u2013 the first confirmed case of chronic wasting disease in the country's most famous nature reserve.\n\nFor years, chronic wasting disease (CWD), caused by prions \u2013 abnormal, transmissible pathogenic agents \u2013 has been spreading stealthily across North America, with concerns voiced primarily by hunters after spotting deer behaving strangely.\n\nThe prions cause changes in the hosts' brains and nervous systems, leaving animals drooling, lethargic, emaciated, stumbling and with a telltale \"blank stare\" that led some to call it \"zombie deer disease\". It spreads through the cervid family: deer, elk, moose, caribou and reindeer. It is fatal, with no known treatments or vaccines.\n\nIts discovery in Yellowstone, whose ecosystem supports the greatest and most diverse array of large wild mammals in the continental US, represents an important public wake-up call, says Dr Thomas Roffe, a vet and former chief of animal health for the Fish & Wildlife Service, a US federal agency.\n\n\"This case puts CWD on the radar of widespread attention in ways it wasn't before \u2013 and that's, ironically, a good thing,\" he says. \"It's a disease that has huge ecological implications.\"\n\nThe disease is a \"slow-moving disaster\", according to Dr Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who studied the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or \"mad cow disease\" \u2013 a related prion condition \u2013 in the UK, and is director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nOnce an environment is infected, the pathogen is extremely hard to eradicate. It can persist for years in dirt or on surfaces, and scientists report it is resistant to disinfectants, formaldehyde, radiation and incineration at 600C (1,100F).\n\nIn the US and Canada, CWD has gained attention not only because it affects big-game animals but also because of the possibility that it could jump the species barrier. Deer, elk and moose could infect livestock, other mammals, birds or even humans.\n\nThe Alliance for Public Wildlife estimated in 2017 that 7,000 to 15,000 CWD-infected animals a year were unwittingly being eaten by humans, and that the number was expected to increase 20% annually.\n\nWyoming serves as a reference point for other states. Since 1997, there have been 92,000 tissue samples collected and tested there. Last year, the meat from 6,701 deer, elk and moose was tested. Disease was present in about 800 samples, suggesting infection rates are rising.\n\nAccording to the US Geological Survey, CWD is now present in 32 states and three Canadian provinces.\n\nStudies suggest that animals which some hunters regard as competitors may actually be allies. Wildlife predators such as wolves, cougars and bears are able to detect sick animals long before humans do, and they will prey on them, removing them from the landscape. So far, they have maintained immunity from disease.\n\n\"We're still at the front end of a scary disease event, and we don't know where it's headed,\" Roffe said. \"There's a lot at stake for the Yellowstone ecosystem, and a lot at stake for all Americans who enjoy having healthy wildlife on the landscape.\"",

    "vclaim": "The first case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been confirmed in Yellowstone National Park after a mule deer buck died there in October. CWD is a fatal prion disease affecting cervids (deer, elk, moose, caribou, and reindeer) that causes brain changes and has no known treatment or vaccine. The disease is extremely difficult to eradicate as it can persist for years in the environment and is resistant to various forms of sterilization. There are concerns that CWD could potentially jump species barriers to affect livestock, other mammals, birds, or humans. The disease has spread to 32 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces, with increasing infection rates observed in Wyoming's wildlife. An estimated 7,000 to 15,000 CWD-infected animals were being unknowingly consumed by humans annually as of 2017, with numbers expected to rise by 20% each year.",
