    "full_text": "Japanese Do Not Celebrate Teachers' Day; They Do This, Instead\n\nResponding to a question about when Teachers' Day is celebrated in Japan, a user on Quora said there was no such concept in the country. The next thing the user said was even more incredible, proving why Japan stands out in terms of progress.\n\nThe user, Yamamoto, said, \"We don't have Teacher's Day,\" people started questioning why a country, which is so advanced in economy, sciences, and technology, is so disrespectful towards teachers and their work. But, the reality is far from it. Japan, reportedly, respects its teachers like no other country.\n\nIn a move to display respect towards teachers, people including elderly ones offer their seats to someone who is a teacher by profession. There are dedicated shops for teachers where goods can be bought for reduced prices. Similarly, many privileges are offered only to teachers. Simply put, in Japan, teaching is the most respected profession and the teacher is the most respected person. Japanese entrepreneurs consider it an honour when teachers come to their stores and shops.\n\nThe utmost respect of the Japanese towards teachers is visible in their actions like seats allocated for them in the metro, special shops for them, and they don't need to line up in a queue for tickets for whatever type of transport. For the teachers in Japan, there is no need to celebrate a special day for teachers as every day is an occasion dedicated to them only.\n\nJapan, to be specific, does not have a formal Teacher's Day but they do have a ceremony on October 1st where they pay their respects to their revered mentors. For those reaching the revered age of 100, the government presents each with a commemorative silver sake cup every year. Thousands of teachers are honoured in these events, highlighting their importance on the special day.",
