    "full_text": "This Clip of a Woman Falling in a Pothole Is From Delhi, Not Uttar Pradesh\n\nA video of a woman being pulled out from a pothole filled with mud is being shared on social media with a claim that it is from Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj.\n\nIn the video, several men can be seen helping out the woman who got stuck in the mud-filled pothole.\n\nHowever, this incident happened in Delhi's Rohini and not in Uttar Pradesh. We spoke with a doctor at the Hira's Multi Speciality Hospital, a building that was seen in the video, who confirmed that the incident was from Delhi.\n\nWe also matched the visuals from the viral video with those on Google Street View.\n\nCLAIM\nThe claim takes a dig at the condition of the roads in Uttar Pradesh. The caption with the video read, \"\u092f\u0947 \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u0928\u0926\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u093e\u0917\u0930\u093e\u091c \u091c\u093f\u0932\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u0921\u093c\u0915 \u0939\u0948\".\n\n[Translation: This is not a river, it is a road in the Prayagraj district of Uttar Pradesh.]\n\nSimilar posts can be seen online.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\nOn observing the video, we could see 'Hira's Multi Speciality Hospital'.\n\nWe conducted a Google search and found out that this hospital is located in Begumpur in Delhi's Rohini.\n\nWe also found a Google street view map of the area which showed the same place seen in the video.\n\nWe also noticed a pothole on the opposite side of the hospital.\n\nOn comparing the viral video to the visuals from Google Maps, we found similarities between the two.\n\nThe Quint also spoke with Dr Viveki Kapoor, who works at the Hira's Multi Speciality Hospital, who confirmed that the incident of the woman falling into the mud-filled pothole happened in front of the hospital, located at Begumpur Extension, Sector 33, in Rohini district.\n\nClearly, a video from Delhi is being falsely shared as one from Uttar Pradesh.\n\n(With inputs from SM Hoax Slayer.)",
