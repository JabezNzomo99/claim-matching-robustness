    "full_text": "A widely circulated post on social media claims that between May 22 and 28, the sun is directly above the equator, referred to as the Equinox. The post further states that during this period, the body experiences rapid dehydration and advises people to drink more water. Let's verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The body experiences rapid dehydration during the equinox which happens between May 22-28.\n\nFact: Equinoxes typically occur around the 20th of March and the 22nd of September each year. During these times, the Sun passes directly above the equator, resulting in nearly equal amounts of day and night worldwide. However, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that equinoxes directly cause rapid dehydration. However, it is important to emphasize that maintaining proper hydration is crucial not only during the equinox but also on any other day, especially during the summer seasons. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nAn equinox is a celestial occurrence characterized by the alignment of the Sun directly above the Earth's equator. The word equinox is derived from two Latin words \u2013 aequus (equal) and nox (night). During an equinox, which transpires twice a year, typically around the 20th of March and the 22nd of September, the Sun will pass directly above the equator, bringing nearly equal amounts of day and night on all parts of Earth. At the equator, an equinox results in about 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of night.\n\nThe March equinox \u2013 also called the vernal equinox \u2013 is the beginning of the spring season in the Northern Hemisphere and the autumn season in the Southern Hemisphere. In 2023, it arrived on the 20th of March. Similarly, The September equinox, also known as the autumnal equinox, marks the beginning of the autumn season in the Northern Hemisphere and the spring season in the Southern Hemisphere. In the year 2023, it will occur on the 23rd of September.\n\nAdditionally, after looking into the matter, it has been discovered that the viral post has been circulating since 2016. However, experts in the field have stated that the claim made in the post about the equinox days causing rapid dehydration in the body is not supported by scientific evidence. They have called it a hoax and confirmed that there is no direct link between the occurrence of equinox and dehydration.\n\nHowever, it is important to highlight that maintaining proper hydration is crucial not only during the equinox but also on any other day, particularly during the summer seasons. It is essential to stay hydrated to ensure optimal health and well-being. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the Indian Meteorological Department has issued warnings about the occurrence of heat waves in several locations across the country. In light of this, the public is advised to take necessary safety precautions to protect themselves from the adverse effects of extreme heat.\n\nTo sum it up, there is no evidence to prove that the occurrence of the equinox will directly cause rapid dehydration.",

    "vclaim": "A viral social media post claims that between May 22-28, the sun is directly above the equator (equinox) and causes rapid dehydration in the body. Equinoxes actually occur around March 20 and September 22 each year, not in May. There is no scientific evidence supporting any connection between equinoxes and rapid dehydration in the human body.",
