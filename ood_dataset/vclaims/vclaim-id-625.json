    "vclaim": "A new HIV prevention injection containing cabotegravir (CAB-LA) is being offered through pilot projects in South Africa, providing two months of protection per shot. The pilot program has administered 19 injections as of February 21, primarily to young women with an average age of 22. Limited supply and high costs from single manufacturer ViiV Healthcare are currently restricting widespread availability of the HIV prevention injection.
