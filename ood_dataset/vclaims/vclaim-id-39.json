Instead, it appears to be a homepage or listing page for multiple fact-check stories from India Today. The HTML includes a list of fact-check headlines and thumbnail images, but no full article content for a single fact-check investigation.\n\nIf you would like me to extract the content of a specific fact-check story, you would need to provide the HTML for that particular article. The current HTML seems to be a collection of fact-check story previews with links, rather than the full text of any individual fact-check report.",
