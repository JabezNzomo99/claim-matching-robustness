    "full_text": "Can diet improve lung health?\n\nPerhaps to some extent. We do not have enough evidence which confirm that diet improves lung health. But oxygen and food when metabolised in the body, they produce energy and carbon dioxide. So, the right amount of nutrients in the body may help people breathe easily. The metabolism of carbohydrates produces carbon dioxide the most for the amount of oxygen used and fat produces the least.\n\nA study has shown that evidence for the impact of higher intakes of fruit and vegetables is amongst the strongest. Other dietary nutrients and dietary patterns require evidence from human studies before conclusions can be made about their effectiveness.\n\nKey points:\n- Insufficient conclusive evidence exists that diet directly improves lung health\n- Food metabolism produces energy and carbon dioxide\n- Proper nutrient balance may support easier breathing\n- Carbohydrate metabolism generates more carbon dioxide compared to fat metabolism\n- Fruits and vegetables show the strongest potential dietary impact on lung health\n- More human studies are needed to definitively establish dietary effects on lung function\n\nThe research suggests a potential relationship between diet and lung health, but more scientific investigation is required to make definitive claims about dietary interventions for lung function.",

    "vclaim": "There is insufficient scientific evidence to conclusively prove that diet directly improves lung health. Food metabolism produces energy and carbon dioxide, with carbohydrates producing more CO2 than fats for the same amount of oxygen used. Among dietary factors, fruits and vegetables show the strongest evidence for potential positive effects on lung health.",
