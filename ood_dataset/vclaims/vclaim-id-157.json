    "full_text": "CPI MP introduces Bill in Rajya Sabha seeking to set up a national commission to control 'medical inflation'\n\nThe bill said healthcare expenses are increasing at a 'very fast rate' every year and even the middle class are not being able to afford hospitalisation\n\nA Communist Party of India (CPI) Member of Parliament has introduced a Bill in the Rajya Sabha seeking to establish a national commission to control medical inflation. The bill highlights that healthcare expenses are rising rapidly every year, making hospitalisation unaffordable even for the middle class.\n\nThe proposed legislation aims to address the escalating medical costs that are putting significant financial strain on Indian households. By establishing a dedicated national commission, the bill seeks to monitor, investigate, and propose measures to control the rising healthcare expenses.\n\nThe key concern raised in the bill is the unsustainable growth of medical costs, which are becoming increasingly difficult for average citizens to manage. The proposed commission would likely have the mandate to:\n\n1. Study and analyze healthcare pricing mechanisms\n2. Investigate factors driving medical inflation\n3. Recommend regulatory measures to control healthcare costs\n4. Ensure affordable and accessible medical treatment for all segments of society\n\nThis legislative effort underscores the growing challenge of healthcare affordability in India, where medical expenses can push families into financial distress.\n\nThe bill reflects a broader concern about the economic burden of healthcare and aims to provide a systematic approach to addressing medical inflation through institutional intervention.",
