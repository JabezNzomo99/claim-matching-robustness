    "full_text": "Vajpayee adds 'Tejas' to air power\n\nBANGALORE: India's light combat aircraft (LCA), the smallest single-engine fighter plane in the world, was named 'Tejas' by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Sunday.\n\nThe first of five new prototypes of the LCA was also rolled out during the event. After an awesome flypast by two technology demonstrators flying in formation, Vajpayee said the 'world-class fighting machine' was a glorious contribution to the nation's defence. \"I am happy to give it the name Tejas. May it bring glory to our aerospace industry,\" he added.\n\nAlso present at the event were Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, defence minister George Fernandes, Karnataka governor T N Chaturvedi and chief minister S M Krishna.\n\nThough LCA had taken a long time from the drawing board to its first flight two years ago, Vajpayee said \"the delay was worth waiting\". He noted that skeptics had written off the project several times, with doubters thinking it made better sense to import similar aircraft, even under technology denial regimes.\n\n\"Our scientists and engineers had to re-invent the wheel in many areas, but they have designed, tested and produced a world-class machine, which our Air Force can fly with pride and confidence,\" Vajpayee said.\n\nThe Prime Minister stressed the need for necessary investment for LCA's commercial production and urged exploring its export potential. He also emphasized India's responsible policy on missile, nuclear and dual-use technologies, ensuring such technologies do not fall into wrong hands.\n\nThe event marked a significant milestone in India's indigenous aerospace development, with Tejas symbolizing the country's technological capabilities and strategic self-reliance in defence manufacturing.",
