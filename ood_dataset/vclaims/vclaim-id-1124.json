    "full_text": "Fact-Check: Coca-Cola Will Not Be Sold as a Cleaning Liquid in China!\n\nA long post on social media platforms has claimed that China has ordered the sale of the American beverage brand, Coca-Cola as a \"sewage cleaning liquid.\"\n\nThe post also claimed that:\n- Chinese authorities have withdrawn Coca-Cola from all grocery stores in the country due to \"scientific research\" on its health effects\n- 500 Chinese prisoners were involved in experiments involving the drink, leading to 75 deaths and 150 infections\n- The decision was based on findings which highlighted its positive properties in plumbing\n\nIs this true?: The claim is false. We found an article from 2018 on a Russian news satire website, Panorama that included similar content as the viral claim about China and Coca-Cola.\n\nFurther, we did not find any credible reports that could prove the sale of the beverage as a cleaning liquid.\n\nHow did we find out?: We ran a keyword search and found a Russian website called Panorama, which published an article in 2018 with the headline, \"Coca-Cola will be sold as a drain cleaner in China.\"\n\nKey verification steps:\n- The article contained the same contents as the viral claim\n- At the bottom of the article, there was a note reading \"All texts on this site are grotesque parodies of reality and are not real news\"\n- A profile of Panorama's founders by Russian news website Meduza described it as publishing \"fictitious news\" and compared it to The Onion\n- Panorama's 'Support Us' page also notes they are a satirical media site\n\nWe also found similar claims from 2018 on Facebook that emerged after Panorama's article.\n\nConclusion: The viral claim is false. It originated from a satirical news website that published a fictitious story in 2018.",
