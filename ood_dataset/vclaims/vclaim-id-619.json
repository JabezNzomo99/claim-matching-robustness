No, that's not true: The company, which owns the Truth Social platform, saw an upward trend that started on July 10, 2024 -- three days before the shooting at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania. Posts on social media recycled erroneous financial filings that covered June, not July, and did not show any data specific to short selling.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on July 17, 2024. It included a claim that \"Soon-to-be unmasked entities bet that President Trump's $DJT stock would plummet ONE DAY before the assassination attempt. Shorts against the Truth Social stock more than doubled from July 1 -July 12, meaning, people or large organizations were predicting that by Monday the stock would plummet, something that undoubtedly would have occurred had President Trump died in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nThe company mentioned in the post, Austin Private Wealth, firmly denied the accusations. On July 17, 2024, it issued a statement explaining that what was perceived as \"suspicious\" was only a clerical error:\n\n\"The SEC filing which showed that Austin Private Wealth shorted a large number of shares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (DJT) was incorrect and we immediately amended it as soon as we learned of the error.\n\nNo client of APW holds, or has ever held, a put on DJT in the quantity initially reported. The correct holding amount was 12 contracts, or 1,200 shares -- not 12 million shares, as was filed in error. In submitting the required report for the second quarter of 2024, a multiplier was applied by a third-party vendor that increased the number of the shares by a multiple of 10,000 for all options contracts (not just DJT). We did not catch the error before approving the filing.\n\nWe filed the report on July 12 to reflect our positions on June 28. We amended it on July 16.\"\n\nThe SEC documents confirmed the amended report was filed on the day the firm said and covered a period ending in June 2024.\n\nIn response to Lead Stories, Austin Private Wealth's chief information security officer, Sarah McNutt, confirmed: \"I can confirm that we did not buy any Truth Social stock shorts or put options in amounts that exceeded what we reported in the corrected filing for the period ending June 2024 from July 1-July 12, 2024.\"\n\nContrary to the claim on X, an upward trend in DJT stock began after July 10, 2024, with a sharply ascending line following the July 13, 2024, shooting at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp. did not issue any statements confirming the claim. As of the writing, its last published press release was on June 13, 2024, and said nothing about Austin Private Wealth.\n\nThe Kremlin-funded propaganda website RT, citing anonymous X accounts, boosted the claim but also incorporated the update about the clerical error in its English-language article.",

    "vclaim": "Social media posts falsely claimed that Trump Media's stock experienced unusually high short selling activity just before an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Austin Private Wealth's apparent large short position in Trump Media stock was actually due to a clerical error in SEC filings, which was later corrected. Contrary to the claims, Trump Media's stock (DJT) actually showed an upward trend starting July 10, 2024, three days before the shooting incident at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania.",
