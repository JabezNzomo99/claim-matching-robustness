In common knowledge, beggars are known to wear outdated clothes and have unkempt hair owing to their financial woes.\n\nBut occasionally, we hear about individuals who have turned begging into a profitable and lucrative profession by levelling up the activity that mostly evokes pity.\n\nWorld's Richest Beggar\n\nAccording to a report by Economic Times, Bharat Jain is the richest beggar in the world and can be seen begging on the streets of Mumbai.\n\nBharat, who could not be formally educated due to his depravation, has a family that includes his wife, two sons, a brother, and his father.\n\nThe Mumbai resident has a net worth of Rs 7.5 crores ($1 million), and unlike him, his children were not deprived of education as they have got the chance to complete their schooling.\n\nBharat makes Rs 60,000-75,000 a month by begging, possesses a two-bedroom flat in Mumbai worth Rs 1.2 crore, and also lets out his two shops in Thane for a rent of Rs 30,000 per month.\n\nDespite becoming handsomely wealthy, Bharat can still be seen begging at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus or Azad Maidan in the country's financial capital.\n\nMakes Rs 2,000-2,500 per day\n\nWhile many individuals toil to acquire a few hundred rupees even after working long hours, Bharat manages to make Rs 2,000-2,500 per day within 10 to 12 hours, thanks to the generosity of people.\n\nAs Bharat Jain and his family reside comfortably in a 1BHK duplex residence in Parel, their kids go to a convent school, and other family members own a stationery store, Bharat has been continually advised not to beg.\n\nBut Bharat does not heed this advice and continues with the begging work.",
