    "full_text": "Hot coconut water not cure for cancer: Hospital\n\nMUMBAI: An inaccurate health message on social media prompted the country's premier cancer care hospital, Tata Memorial Centre in Parel, to issue a statement that the message was unscientific and was never uttered by its director, Dr Rajendra Badwe. The message suggested that drinking hot coconut water daily would destroy cancer cells by releasing an anti-cancer substance.\n\nIt stressed that it was the latest treatment for all types of cancer.\n\nThe Tata Memorial Hospital statement on Thursday said the message was wrong as there was no scientific data to suggest that hot coconut water could cure cancer. Signed by Dr Badwe, the message requested the public to not be misinformed by such harmful messages shared on social media.\n\n\"It does more harm than good,\" concurred Dr C S Pramesh, director of Tata Memorial Hospital. He said, \"A lot of patients get carried away by such messages. In fact, they divert from main treatment. It proves harmful in the long run.\" He added, \"There was another instance that suggested cow urine could cure cancer. There is no data to suggest that, and it is extremely dangerous to rely on such techniques.\"\n\nDr Altaf Patel, director, Department of Medicine at Jaslok Hospital, stated, \"People should not believe in fake health messages. It is gullible to do so.\"",
