Historical Context:\n- In 2018, Cape Town experienced severe water scarcity\n- The city introduced a \"Zero Day\" concept where water supply was critically low\n- Residents were limited to 25 liters of water per day from public taps\n- However, the city managed to avoid complete water shutdown through proper planning\n\n2. Current Situation (2023):\n- No evidence was found supporting the claim that Cape Town will be water-less from April 14, 2023\n- Recent reports suggest the city has improved its water management strategies\n- The viral message appears to be misrepresenting the 2018 water crisis\n\n3. Key Sources:\n- Loksatta article (March 4, 2018)\n- Global Resilience research report\n- Brookings.edu article (March 22, 2023)\n\nConclusion: The claim is FALSE. Cape Town has not been declared a water-less city, and there is no indication of water supply being discontinued.\n\nResult: False",
