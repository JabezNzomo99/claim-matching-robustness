    "full_text": "An image circulating widely on social media purports to depict the official schedule of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Let's verify its authenticity through this article.\n\nClaim: Official schedule of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nFact: The Election Commission of India clarified that it is a fake message. As of 26 February 2024, the ECI has yet to announce the schedule for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nInitially, we scrutinized the official website and social media platforms of the Election Commission of India (ECI) but didn't find notices or press releases regarding the 2024 Lok Sabha election schedule.\n\nFurther investigation revealed a post shared by the ECI on X, clarifying that a viral message circulating on WhatsApp regarding the schedule for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections is baseless and fake. The post featured the same viral image and stated that the dates for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections have not been announced by the ECI yet.\n\nPreviously, FACTLY also debunked a viral message that falsely presented the 2019 election schedule as the 2024 Lok Sabha election schedule.\n\nTo sum it up, a fabricated schedule is being shared on social media falsely claiming as 2024 Lok Sabha election schedule.",
