Do not believe it\n\nThe headline clearly indicates this is a fact-check article about a potentially misleading social media post regarding a \"Muslim Regiment\".\n\nUnfortunately, the HTML content provided does not include the full text of the article. The parsing instructions were followed meticulously, but the actual article body is missing from the HTML snippet. Without the complete text, I cannot extract the detailed explanation of why the post is considered false and dangerous.\n\nThe only additional context available is from the image caption, which mentions Major Abdul Rafey Khan of Garhwal Rifles, who was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously on Sept 17, 1965, for displaying \"exemplary courage and devotion to duty and made the supreme sacrifice of his life.\"\n\nTo provide the complete fact-check content, I would need the full text of the article, which is not present in this HTML fragment.",
