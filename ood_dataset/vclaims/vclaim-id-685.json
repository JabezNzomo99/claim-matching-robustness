Further, the government has clarified that only specific individuals who meet certain criteria, such as involvement in financial irregularities or having substantial tax arrears, are required to secure this certificate. The new provision will come into effect from October 1, 2024.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, through the Union Budget 2024, has introduced a significant amendment for those planning to move abroad from India. This new provision mandates that individuals domiciled in India must clear all tax dues and obtain 'clearance certificates' before leaving the country. However, the government on Sunday clarified that the proposed amendment does not require every person to obtain a tax clearance certificate.\n\nInstead, only specific individuals who meet certain criteria, such as involvement in financial irregularities or having substantial tax arrears, are required to secure this certificate. The proposed amendment ensures a focused and justified application of this requirement, affecting only those who fall within these defined categories.\n\nWho needs to get this tax clearance certificate?\n\n1. Involvement in Serious Financial Irregularities: If a person is suspected of serious financial misconduct and their presence is crucial for investigations under the Income-tax Act or the Wealth-tax Act, and if it's likely that a tax demand will be raised against them, they need to obtain a tax clearance certificate.\n\n2. Outstanding Direct Tax Arrears: If a person has direct tax arrears exceeding Rs 10 lakh that have not been stayed by any authority, they must obtain a tax clearance certificate.\n\nAs per the notification, before a person is asked to obtain a tax clearance certificate, the reasons for this requirement must be documented. Approval must also be obtained from the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income-tax or the Chief Commissioner of Income-tax.\n\nThe certificate itself is issued by the income-tax authority, stating that the person has no outstanding liabilities under the Income-tax Act, the Wealth-tax Act, 1957, the Gift-tax Act, 1958, or the Expenditure-tax Act, 1987.\n\nThe government has mandated that a person who is liable to pay any taxes, or yet to clear any kind of tax dues cannot leave the nation unless their taxes are cleared.\n\nThe new provision will come into effect from October 1, 2024. It should be noted that the old provisions for taxpayers planning to leave India under the Income Tax Act remain the same.",

    "vclaim": "The Indian government has introduced a new provision requiring specific individuals with tax dues or financial irregularities to obtain tax clearance certificates before leaving the country, effective October 1, 2024. Only individuals involved in serious financial irregularities under investigation or those with direct tax arrears exceeding Rs 10 lakh need to obtain the tax clearance certificate, not all persons leaving India. The tax clearance certificate will be issued by income-tax authorities after confirming no outstanding liabilities under various tax acts including Income-tax, Wealth-tax, Gift-tax, and Expenditure-tax Acts.",
