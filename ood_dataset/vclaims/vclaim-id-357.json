Many people will say that the reason in Narendra Modi, that the reason is BJP, that the reason is RSS,\" he can be heard saying.\n\nLater, three minutes into the video, Rahul Gandhi can be heard saying that the youth of India are lost and in fear because of unemployment.

He is then heard saying \"This garbage \u2026 give me an estimate of the cost it would take to clear this garbage\u2026.5 crore? 10 crore? Look, a 10 year old is saying that 10 Crores will be required. So\u2026 even if we say it will take Rs10 Cr? A few days ago, Narendra Modi has waived off Rs. 1,30,000 crore in tax for the richest people in India. You live in dirt 24/7, and those people live in palaces and aeroplanes in peace.\"\n\nThe three sequences have been edited together to make it appear as though Rahul Gandhi was blaming Narendra Modi for unemployment among eagles.\n\nResult: Altered Media\n\nSources:\n- Video posted on YouTube page of Indian National Congress, on February 5, 2020\n- Video posted on YouTube page of Rahul Gandhi, on February 5, 2020\n- Report published on the Times Of India, dated February 6, 2020",

    "vclaim": "A viral video falsely shows Rahul Gandhi blaming Prime Minister Modi for unemployment among eagles by editing together three separate parts of his speech from a 2020 Delhi election campaign event. In the original speech, Rahul Gandhi separately discussed Modi's communal politics, youth unemployment, and the contrast between garbage-filled neighborhoods and tax breaks for the wealthy.",
