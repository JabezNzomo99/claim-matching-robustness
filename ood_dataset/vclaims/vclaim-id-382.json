    "full_text": "FACT SHIELD: All you need to know about BVAS, INEC's new system for tackling electoral fraud\n\nThere's been quite some controversy around the Bi-Modal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) being employed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the presidential and subnational elections in February 2023. Some political parties have called on INEC to disregard the accreditation system, while others are in support of the bi-modal biometric method.\n\nWHAT IS THE BIMODAL BIOMETRICS METHOD?\n\"Bimodal\" means to have two modes. Biometrics are distinctive, measurable characteristics which can be physical or behavioural, used to digitally identify a person. Examples include fingerprint, palm veins, face recognition, DNA, palmprint, hand geometry, iris recognition, retina and odour/scent.\n\nWHAT IS BVAS?\nThe Bi-Modal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) is an electronic device introduced by INEC in 2021 to read Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and authenticate voters using both fingerprints and facial recognition to prove voter eligibility at a particular polling unit.\n\nThe device is also used for capturing images of polling unit result sheets (Form EC8A) and uploading these images on INEC's Election Result Viewing platform (IReV).\n\nWHAT IS IREV?\nIReV is an online portal where polling unit-level results are uploaded directly from the polling unit, transmitted, and published publicly. The portal allows citizens to create personal accounts to access all uploaded results stored as PDF files, increasing transparency and public trust in the process.\n\nHAS THIS BEEN USED IN OTHER COUNTRIES?\nYes. Somaliland first used iris recognition-based voting in 2017. Ghana successfully used biometric voter management systems in 2020. Kenya, Angola, and other African countries have also implemented various biometric voting technologies.\n\nADVANTAGES OF BVAS\nBVAS helps solve 10 key election process flaws:\n1. Vote alteration at polling units\n2. Distortion of accredited voter numbers\n3. Collation of false results\n4. Result sheet mutilation and computational errors\n5. Result sheet swapping\n6. Result sheet forgery\n7. Result sheet snatching and destruction\n8. Involuntary result declaration\n9. Premature result declaration\n10. Poor record-keeping\n\nHOW DOES BVAS WORK?\nThe device verifies voters by scanning PVC barcodes, entering Voter Identity Number digits, or typing the voter's last name. It has eliminated the use of incident forms during accreditation.\n\nPREVIOUS USAGE IN NIGERIA\nBVAS has been used in several elections since 2021, including:\n- September 2021: Isoko South Constituency bye-election\n- November 2021: Anambra State Governorship election\n- February 2022: FCT Area Council Election\n- June 2022: Ekiti State Governorship Election\n- July 2022: Osun State Governorship Election\n\nEach deployment revealed technical challenges but also demonstrated significant improvements in electoral transparency.\n\nCONCLUSION\nBVAS represents a technological advancement to reduce electoral fraud, providing a more level playing field. While not perfect, it continues to improve and offers a promising solution for more credible elections.",

    "title": "Just like the General elections, INEC is to use the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) in the conduct of the off-cycle elections.\nThe mock exercise held simultaneously across the three states on 14 October affirmed the use of the system as confirmed by the National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Sam Olumekun",
    "vclaim": "BVAS is an electronic device introduced by INEC in 2021 that uses fingerprints and facial recognition to authenticate voters and their PVCs at polling units. The BVAS system captures and uploads polling unit result sheets to INEC's IReV platform, an online portal where results are publicly accessible. Biometric voting systems have been successfully implemented in other African countries including Somaliland, Ghana, Kenya, and Angola. BVAS helps address ten major electoral process flaws including vote alteration, result sheet manipulation, and false result collation. The BVAS system has been used in several Nigerian elections since 2021, including state governorship elections in Anambra, Ekiti, and Osun states.",
