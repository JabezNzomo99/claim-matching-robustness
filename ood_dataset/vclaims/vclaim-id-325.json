    "full_text": "Fake Indian Express Interview With Adani Promotes Crypto Scam\n\nA news report is doing the rounds on social media, stating that Indian billionaire industrialist Gautam Adani has found a get-rich-quick scheme that is transforming people's lives.\n\nAccording to the report, Adani announced a new \"wealth loophole\" during an interview with journalist Sonal Mehrotra Kapoor in the show Good Morning India, where he allegedly said that he can transform anyone into a millionaire within three-four months. The report adds that the businessman has urged everyone in India to jump into this amazing opportunity before the big banks shut it down for good.\n\nThe scheme Adani purportedly referred to is a new cryptocurrency auto-trading program called Ethereum Code, which is \"helping regular people in India, Asia and North America build fortunes overnight\". The report further describes how the program, \"backed by Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Bill Gates\", is designed to cash in on the cryptocurrency boom and how it's looking beyond conventional currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nFact Check:\n\nNewschecker first noticed the masthead of the webpage, reading \"Indian Expres\", which is not how the news major is spelt. The correct spelling of the publication is \"Indian Express\" and the logo on the official website can be seen only on one side, flanking the word \"The\". We also noticed the URL of the news report is \"clrygdnwd.digital\", which is different from the official Indian Express website. The official URL is https://indianexpress.com, confirming that the supposed Adani interview is from a dubious website.\n\nNewschecker then did a keyword search for the terms \"Adani Ethereum code\", \"Adani Indian Express Interview,\" \"Adani bitcoin scheme\", and found that there were no news reports, either from Indian Express nor from any other news website on such an announcement from the businessman.\n\nWhile reading the article, we found several inconsistencies and factual errors, such as Adani's age being listed as 79 instead of 60 and a sudden reference to one Bachchan as the interviewee. Towards the end of the article, we came across a case study of Aarav Chadha, an online editor who volunteered to try out Ethereum Code. We ran a reverse image search of the picture of Aarav Chadha and his family and found it to be a stock image of an Indian family.\n\nUpon clicking the word Ethereum Code mentioned across the article, we were taken to a suspicious web page asking for bank details, vague descriptions of funding and requests to register quickly, all signs pointing to a scam.\n\nThe article also stated that Adani had appeared on a show \"Good Morning India\", upon invitation by co-host Sonal Mehrotra Kapoor, to share any tips he had on building wealth. This was where the \"tycoon and bountiful philanthropist dropped a bomb\", regarding the \"wealth loophole\". We ran a keyword search for such an interview between Adani and Kapoor and got no relevant results.\n\nConclusion:\nAn imposter website, using a fake Indian Express interview with Gautam Adani, is misleading people into investing in a shady cryptocurrency program.\n\nResult: False",
