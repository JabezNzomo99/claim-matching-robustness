    "full_text": "FALSE: 'Required' COVID-19 home medical kit\n\nClaim:\nHouseholds should have \"required\" medical kits with certain items and equipment to treat the different stages of COVID-19. \n\nAccording to some Facebook posts and WhatsApp messages, a COVID-19 medical kit \"required at home\" must have the following:\n- Paracetamol\n- Betadine for mouthwash and gargle\n- Vitamin C and D3\n- Vitamin B complex\n- Vapor+ capsules for steam\n- Oximeter\n- Oxygen cylinder (for emergency only)\n- Breathing exercises\n\nThe posts claim these medical items or equipment can treat or prevent COVID-19 from progressing at each stage of the disease.\n\nRating: FALSE\n\nThe facts:\nSo far, there are no required or prescribed home medical kits for COVID-19. Experts also do not recommend self-medication at home to prevent or cure COVID-19. The medical equipment listed in the claim should likewise be used with medical supervision.\n\n\"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease,\" the World Health Organization (WHO) said. \"WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.\"\n\nThere is no scientific evidence that:\n- Betadine\n- Specific vitamins\n- Steam inhalation\n- Drinking hot water \n\ncan cure COVID-19.\n\nIn case of fever due to mild COVID-19, doctors recommend taking paracetamol only to manage symptoms. Vitamins such as Vitamins C, D3, and B complex may only help improve immune response against the virus.\n\nRegarding medical equipment:\n- Pulse oximeters are used by COVID-19 treatment facilities to monitor patients, but are not recommended for home use without medical supervision\n- WHO does not recommend oxygen cylinders for home use, as their storage and transportation require trained personnel\n\nAs the disease spreads in different stages, scientists suggest that experimental drugs and treatments need to be evaluated based on the specific disease phase and bodily changes.\n\nThe remaining part of the Facebook posts and WhatsApp messages contain other previously debunked supposed COVID-19 \"cures\" like consuming alkaline food, garlic, and bananas.",

    "title": "Fact: This false claim has been around since June 2020. The World Health Organization says it 'does not recommend self-medication with any medicines...as a prevention or cure for COVID-19'",
    "vclaim": "Social media posts falsely claim that households must have specific medical kits containing items like paracetamol, vitamins, betadine, oximeter, and oxygen cylinder to treat different stages of COVID-19. There are no officially required or prescribed home medical kits for COVID-19, and self-medication is not recommended by health authorities. Common items listed in these viral messages like betadine, specific vitamins, and steam inhalation have no scientific evidence proving they can cure COVID-19. Medical equipment like pulse oximeters and oxygen cylinders should only be used under medical supervision, not for unsupervised home use.",
