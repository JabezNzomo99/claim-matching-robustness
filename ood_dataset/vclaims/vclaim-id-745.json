    "full_text": "Here is the extracted text content from the HTML, translated from Telugu to English for clarity:\n\nClaim: Justice Dalveer Bhandari was recently elected as the Chief Justice of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\n\nFact (Truth): There is no 'Chief Justice' position in the International Court of Justice. Justice Dalveer Bhandari has been a court member since 27 April 2012 and was re-elected for a nine-year term from 06 February 2018. Therefore, the post's claim is misleading.\n\nThe ICJ statute does not mention a 'Chief Justice' position. The ICJ elects a President and Vice President for a three-year term (as per Article 21 of the ICJ statute). On 08 February 2021, Judge John E. Donoghue (USA) and Judge Kirill Gevorgian (Russian Federation) were elected as President and Vice President.\n\nThe ICJ website lists details of all court members, and according to the website, there is no position of Chief Justice. Justice Dalveer Bhandari is listed as a member, not as the Chief Justice.\n\nOn 27 April 2012, during the UPA government, Justice Dalveer Bhandari was elected as an ICJ member. He succeeded Mr. Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh (Jordan) who had resigned the previous year. As per Article 15 of the ICJ statute, Bhandari served the remaining term until 05 February 2018. In November 2017, he was re-elected as a member. His second nine-year term began on 06 February 2018.\n\nICJ members are elected by the UN General Assembly and Security Council. To be elected, a candidate must secure an absolute majority in both bodies - 97 votes in the General Assembly and eight votes in the Security Council. Veto rights do not apply in these elections.\n\nIn 2017, when Justice Bhandari was re-elected, Judge Christopher Greenwood (UK) also competed for the same position. Initially, neither secured a full majority. Eventually, the British candidate withdrew, recognizing their numerical disadvantage. Bhandari ultimately secured 15 votes in the Security Council and 183 out of 193 votes in the UN General Assembly - the first time since 1945 that a British judge was not on the court.\n\nThe ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, established by the UN Charter in June 1945 and beginning operations in April 1946. The court comprises 15 judges elected for nine-year terms by the General Assembly and Security Council, with its seat in the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nFinally, Justice Dalveer Bhandari was not elected as the ICJ's 'Chief Justice' - such a position does not exist. He is currently a court member, elected for a nine-year term in 2018.",

    "vclaim": "Justice Dalveer Bhandari was falsely claimed to have been elected as the Chief Justice of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), when no such position exists. Justice Bhandari has been serving as a member of the ICJ since 2012 and was re-elected in 2018 for a nine-year term. In the 2017 ICJ election, Bhandari's victory over the British candidate marked the first time since 1945 that a British judge was not on the court.",
