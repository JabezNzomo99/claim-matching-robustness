India Today's AFWA probes the truth.\n\nClaim:\nLata Mangeshkar sang Kishore Kumar's popular number \"Yeh Jeevan Hai\" and gifted it to him on a special tape on her birthday.\n\nFact:\nThe cover of Kishore Kumar's \"Yeh Jeevan Hai\" by Lata Mangeshkar is not a private recording, done specifically for Kishore Kumar. It was part of Mangeshkar's album \"Shraddhanjali: My Tribute To The Immortals\".\n\nThe viral story, which has been circulating on social media, suggests an emotional narrative about the relationship between two legendary singers. Multiple Facebook users have shared this story with the song.\n\nThe story claims that Kishore Kumar once asked Lata Mangeshkar which of his songs she liked best, and she ultimately recorded the song as a special gift for him. However, this is false.\n\nAFWA contacted several sources to verify the claim:\n\n1. Siddhartha Laik, founder editor of IWMBUZZ.com, confirmed their earlier reporting that the story is a hoax.\n\n2. Mahesh Rathore, Lata Mangeshkar's private secretary for 26 years, stated he had never heard this story before.\n\n3. Yatindra Mishra, author of a biography on Lata Mangeshkar, also confirmed he had never heard of such an incident.\n\nLata Mangeshkar herself had previously denied this story, stating, \"I don't recall any such incident. Kishore Da and I were very close to one another... I cannot single out any one of his songs as my favourite.\"\n\nThe song \"Yeh Jeevan Hai\" was originally composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal for the film \"Piya Ka Ghar\". Mangeshkar's version can be found on music streaming platforms like Gaana and JioSaavn as part of her tribute album.\n\nThus, the viral story involving Lata Mangeshkar and Kishore Kumar and the song \"Yeh Jeevan Hai\" is a baseless rumour.",
