The BJP leaders are levelling baseless allegations only to mislead the public and polarise the people along the communal line for political leverage of which they should be ashamed, the chief minister said. The BJP turned the heat on the government for passing the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill in the Assembly. In this bill, temples with certain income will have to pay a tax to the government. The BJP termed the move as anti-Hindu and condemned the Congress.\n\nThe Karnataka government said the recent amendment actually made it free for the temples with up to \u20b910 lakh annual income while they have been paying tax so far \u2013 during the BJP government too.\n\nWhat is the Karnataka temple tax?\n\nAfter the amendment for which the government is drawing flak, temples with gross annual income over \u20b91 crore will have to pay 10% of their income to a common pool. The amount is 5% for temples with a gross annual income between \u20b910 lakh and \u20b91 crore.\n\nBefore the amendment, Siddaramaiah said, the tax was 10% for temples whose gross annual income exceeds \u20b910 lakh and 5% for temples with a gross annual income between \u20b95 lakh and \u20b910 lakh.\n\n\"The recent amendment was made solely to enhance the amount of the common pool. The common pool is administered solely for religious purposes connected with the Hindu religion. The Common Pool Fund has been utilized only for the religious purposes of Hindu institutions since the Act came into force in 2003, and it will continue to be used for the same purposes in the future. It has not been utilized for any other purposes or for the benefit of followers of other religions,\" Siddaramaiah wrote.\n\nAll this money will reach the Dharmik Parishad.\n\nWhat is common pool fund for Karnataka temples? What is Dharmik Parishad?\n\nThe common pool fund is for all religious purposes and the government said there was a need to increase the fund. Dharmik Parishad is a committee to oversee all temple management for the benefit of pilgrims.\n\nThere are 3,000 temples in Karnataka with less than \u20b95 lakh income from where 'Dharmika Parishad' gets no money, the government said. \"Now what we have done is we have made it free from paying to Dharmika Parishad if the income is up to \u20b910 lakh. We have made provisions to collect five per cent from temples whose gross income is between \u20b910 lakh and less than one crore. Ten per cent of the income will be collected from temples whose income is above \u20b9one crore. All this amount will reach the Dharmika Parishad,\" transport and Hindu religious endowments minister Ramalinga Reddy said. \"If the money reaches Dharmika Parishad then we can provide them insurance cover. We want that their families to get at least \u20b9five lakh if something happens to them. To pay the premium we need \u20b9seven crore to \u20b9eight crore,\" the minister said.",

    "vclaim": "The Karnataka government amended the temple tax law, making temples with annual income up to \u20b910 lakh tax-free while implementing a 5-10% tax on temples with higher incomes. The BJP accused the Congress government of being anti-Hindu for passing the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah claims the temple tax existed during the previous BJP government and the recent amendment only changes the tax structure. The collected temple tax goes to a common pool fund (Dharmik Parishad) that is exclusively used for Hindu religious purposes and temple management. The government plans to use the increased temple tax revenue to provide insurance coverage for temple workers' families.",
