    "title": "Fact: Newschecker\u2019s investigation revealed that the viral forward about SIM Swap fraud is partly false. If the user is targeted by a SIM card swap fraud, their bank accounts will not be emptied immediately as is claimed, as scammers need to know the user\u2019s bank logins and passwords through other phishing scams. SIM card swap will only allow scammers to intercept OTPs to complete transactions.",
    "vclaim": "A viral message claims that during SIM swap fraud, victims lose network connectivity and receive calls from fake service providers asking them to enter numbers to resume service. SIM swap fraud actually occurs when scammers convince carriers to transfer a victim's phone number to their own SIM card, typically using previously obtained personal information. The viral message's description of SIM swap fraud is misleading as it oversimplifies the scam process and falsely suggests that bank accounts are immediately emptied.",
