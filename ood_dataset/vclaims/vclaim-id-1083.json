    "full_text": "HOAX: This post containing advice on how to kill the COVID-19 with heat is false\n\nThe post advises inhalation of hot steam, drinking hot tea, and gargling hot fluids, but these measures do not work against the disease.\n\nA Facebook post with an image claiming that a combination of inhaling very hot steam from a kettle, hot gargles, and drinking hot tea four times a day can cure COVID-19 is FALSE.\n\nThe image is an undated screenshot attributed to an unidentified person living in Wuhan, stating that the steps contained were taken by residents in the city to protect against COVID-19. Wuhan is where the first case of COVID-19 was reported, and the text in the image further claims that every household in the city has a COVID-19 patient, adding that residents are no longer going to the hospital to seek treatment and are instead treating themselves.\n\nIt is unlikely that every household in Wuhan has had a COVID-19 patient, given that the total national tally of confirmed cases in China stood at 87,028 on July 27, 2020. Over 11 million people reside in the metropolitan area of Wuhan, which is the capital of Hubei Province in central China, and the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is a small fraction of this by comparison.\n\nThe screenshot says that adopting the treatment routine as suggested will kill the coronavirus in four days, and on the fifth day, one should get a negative test result.\n\nHowever, while it is true that heat at 56\u00b0C can kill the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 min (quick reduction), according to data on the resistance of the SARS Coronavirus against environmental factors and disinfectants published on the WHO website, there is still no way to increase your body temperature beyond the normal 36.5\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C in order to kill the COVID-19 virus.\n\nAdditionally, ingesting hot beverages can actually elevate the risk of developing oesophageal cancer, according to a 2016 study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the WHO.\n\nThe WHO's Technical Report Series 916 on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases warns against consuming drinks when they are at scalding hot temperature, as one of the recommendations to reduce the risk of developing cancer.\n\nFurther, the WHO maintains that there are currently no approved cures for COVID-19 and the organisation's page advising the public on COVID-19 does not list inhaling steam, drinking hot tea or hot gargles as treatment for the virus.\n\nWHO has previously debunked a number of claims that associate conditions of heat to the diminished survival of coronavirus, such as the claim that taking a hot bath is a preventive measure against the disease.\n\nSeveral versions of the text have been circulating on Facebook from as early as April 2020, some with added text appealing to users to spread the message widely. However, the claims contained in the post are likely to cause harm, and do not protect against COVID-19.\n\nPesaCheck has looked into the claim that a combination of inhaling very hot steam from a kettle, hot gargles, and drinking hot tea four times a day can cure COVID-19, and finds it to be FALSE.",

    "vclaim": "A viral post claims that inhaling hot steam from a kettle, doing hot gargles, and drinking hot tea four times daily can cure COVID-19. The post falsely claims that every household in Wuhan has a COVID-19 patient and residents are treating themselves at home instead of going to hospitals. The post incorrectly states that following this heat-based treatment routine will kill coronavirus in four days and result in a negative test on the fifth day. While heat at 56\u00b0C can kill the SARS coronavirus, it's impossible to safely raise body temperature enough to kill COVID-19 virus. Consuming very hot beverages can actually be harmful and increase the risk of developing esophageal cancer according to WHO research.",
