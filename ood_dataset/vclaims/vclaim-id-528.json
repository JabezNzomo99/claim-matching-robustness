    "title": "Contrary to the rumors, Microsoft has not made any official announcements regarding the appointment of Dolly Chaiwala as the brand ambassador for Windows 12. The genesis of this rumor can be traced back to a post by The Bindu Times, a satirical news parody account on Instagram. The catalyst for this rumor was Bill Gates\u2019 visit to India, during which he made a stop at Dolly Chaiwala\u2019s tea stall. A video titled \u2018One Chai Please\u2019 captured Gates enjoying a cup of tea brewed by Dolly himself.",
