    "full_text": "BJP launches unique missed call campaign ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha polls\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has launched a unique 'missed call' campaign with a special number: 9090902024. This initiative aims to expand the party's support base and is reminiscent of the membership drive conducted by the party in 2019.\n\nThe number itself holds significant symbolism, representing the nine years of the Modi government and the crucial election year of 2024. The BJP, known for its strategic approach, has carefully chosen this number as a nod to its past nine years in power while seeking a renewed mandate from the people in the upcoming polls.\n\nTo kickstart this massive outreach effort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will sound the poll bugle for the Mahasampark Abhiyan on May 31 from Ajmer, Rajasthan. This month-long blitzkrieg, from May 31 to June 30, will witness 51 rallies, over 500 meetings, and press conferences in more than 600 areas across all parliamentary seats.\n\nA key focus of the campaign will be on the 144 seats that the BJP lost in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The party has divided 543 Lok Sabha seats into 144 clusters, each consisting of three to four constituencies, with over 288 Lok Sabha MPs and senior leaders assigned to spend eight days in these clusters. The objective is to hold various public connect programmes, engage with beneficiaries of government schemes, and present the government's report card on good governance and welfare measures.\n\nBJP national general secretary Tarun Chungh said the party's three organisational blocks\u2014Lok Sabha, Vidhan Sabha, and booths will be covered under this initiative. Over the next month, more than 16 lakh party workers will conduct programmes in over 4,000 legislative assemblies, ensuring outreach in every corner of the country, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup.\n\nAdditionally, party workers will carry out a missed call campaign across 10 lakh booths, urging voters to give a missed call to link them to the party's database. Under the Sampark Se Samarthan (contact for support) campaign, booth workers will reach out to 20-30 families in each booth, ultimately connecting with over 5 lakh families nationwide.\n\nTo further boost morale, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address party workers digitally as part of the campaign, while motorcycle rallies will be organised in villages. The month-long programme will also commemorate the 48th anniversary of the Emergency on June 25 and the 70th death anniversary of Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee on June 23.\n\nApart from PM Modi, senior party leaders including BJP Chief JP Nadda, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, and Home Minister Amit Shah will address 51 rallies across the country.\n\nOne of the noteworthy campaigns during this period will be \"Vikas Tirth\", where party workers will visit sites representing developmental achievements such as new roads, institutes, and other resources built by the central government in each Lok Sabha constituency.\n\nThe BJP's 'missed call' campaign, coupled with its extensive outreach efforts, highlights the party's determination to expand its support base and secure a strong mandate in the upcoming 2024 general election.",
