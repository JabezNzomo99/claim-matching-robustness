He was born on 16 October 1861 at Alsisar. His father was Thakur Chattu Singh, a resident of Alsisar. Ajit Singh was later adopted to Khetri and after the death of Fateh Singh, he became the eighth king of Khetri in 1870. In 1876, he married Rani Champawatiji Sahiba and the couple had one son and two daughters. He died on 18 January 1901 due to an accident at the tomb of Akbar in Sikandra near Agra and was cremated at Mathura.\n\nAjit Singh was a close friend and disciple of Swami Vivekananda. He suggested him to keep the name 'Vivekananda' instead of Sachidananda, which he used before. Swami Vivekananda went to Khetri and met Ajit Singh thrice in his lifetime\u2014 in 1891, 1893 and 1897. Ajit Singh is known for providing financial support to Vivekananda, and encouraging him to speak at the Parliament of the World's Religions at Chicago in 1893.\n\nFrom 1891 Ajit Singh started sending a monthly stipend of \u20b9100 to Vivekananda's family in Kolkata. On 1 December 1898 Vivekananda wrote a letter to Ajit Singh from Belur requesting him to make the donation permanent so that even after Vivekananda's death his mother (Bhuvaneswari Devi 1841\u20131911) gets the financial assistance on a regular basis. The letter archive of Khetri reveals he had frequent communication with the family members of Vivekananda.\n\nSome key details about his life:\n- Born in 1861 in Alsisar, Rajasthan\n- Adopted by Raja Fateh Singh and became ruler of Khetri in 1870\n- Married Rani Champawatiji Sahiba in 1876\n- Had two daughters (Surya Kumari and Chandra Kumari) and one son (Jai Singh)\n- Died in 1901 in an accident at Akbar's tomb in Agra\n- Closely associated with Swami Vivekananda, providing crucial financial and moral support\n\nThe passage highlights Ajit Singh's significant role in supporting Swami Vivekananda's work and his contributions to spreading Vivekananda's message.",
