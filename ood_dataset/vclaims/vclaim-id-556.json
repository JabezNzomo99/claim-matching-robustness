    "full_text": "A video is being shared on social media with a claim that Rahul Gandhi promised potato farmers that he will install a machine that can convert potatoes into gold. Let's fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Rahul Gandhi saying that he will install a machine that can convert potatoes into gold.\n\nFact: It is a clipped video; he did not promise any such machine. In his full speech, Rahul Gandhi alleged that PM Modi made such a promise to the people. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, a video of Rahul Gandhi's speech in Gujarat was found in the search results. The video shows Rahul Gandhi addressing the people of Patan ahead of the 2017 Gujarat Elections. In his speech, Rahul Gandhi discusses the hardships faced by various communities in Gujarat like farmers, businessmen, etc., and the government's apathy in providing employment opportunities to the youth of the state. Rahul Gandhi also took a dig at PM Modi's promises and his 'demonetisation' move.\n\nThe context of the statements that Rahul Gandhi has made in the posted clip can be heard from 17:50 duration. Rahul Gandhi said \u2013 \"he (Modi) said to Potato farmers that he will install such a machine where potato is inserted from one side and gold will come out from another side. Insert potato from one side and take gold from the other side\u2026\u2026Not my words, these are the words of Narendra Modi\" (translated version). So, the posted video is a clipped one and Rahul Gandhi did not promise a machine that can convert potatoes into gold.\n\nSome users on social media have also shared another video claiming that PM Modi made a similar promise in one of his speeches. However, we found that it is also a clipped and heavily edited video. It was taken from Modi's speech in Kannauj (UP) in 2019. While talking about the setting up of clusters for potatoes, at 23:45 duration in the video, PM Modi can be heard saying \u2013 \"we do not make promises like some people who claim of making gold from potatoes. Forgive us, we cannot do such things. Neither my party nor I can make gold from potatoes. If somebody wants gold from potatoes, please go to them\u2026\u2026 We can only make cold storages, value-addition to potatoes, etc.\u2026\u2026\" (translated).\n\nTo sum it up, edited videos are being shared as Rahul Gandhi and PM Modi promising machines that can convert potatoes into gold.",

    "title": "None of them made any such promise. Each of them was accusing other of capable of making such a promise.",
    "vclaim": "Social media posts falsely claim Rahul Gandhi promised to install a machine that converts potatoes into gold, when in fact he was criticizing PM Modi by alleging that Modi had made such a promise. Another misleading social media claim suggests PM Modi promised a potato-to-gold machine, but the full video shows Modi actually mocking such unrealistic promises while discussing practical solutions like cold storage facilities.",
