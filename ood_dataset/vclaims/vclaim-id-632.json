For the past one and a half years, job seekers in the hotel and cargo sectors in Kenya have fallen prey to scammers who purposely target these sectors by purporting to offer opportunities.\n\nThese con artists play on the fact that in Africa, the growth rate of available job opportunities pales compared to population growth. The scammers use several tricks such as creating job advertisements on websites, signing purported appointment letters, or inviting \"appointees\" to report for work.\n\nPesaCheck has, since 2021, debunked 10 fake jobs, with many using the name \"Mara\" as their location at the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Others choose \"Cargo\" to legitimize their companies.\n\n10 Ways to Spot a Job Scam:\n\n1. Social Media Presence\nCheck the organization's Facebook page transparency. A red flag is when a page has changed its name multiple times.\n\n2. Website Authenticity\nBe wary if the website is:\n- Inaccessible\n- Under constant maintenance\n- Has a URL different from the company name\n- Uses images lifted from other sites\n- Contains inconsistent information\n\n3. Payment Requests\nLegitimate jobs do not ask you to pay fees. For example:\n- Food handling certificates should cost around KSh1,000\n- Cargo companies do not charge for handling certificates\n\n4. Company Existence\nVerify the company's existence by:\n- Checking Google Maps street view\n- Searching the Business Registration Service (BRS)\n- Contacting county government for licensing information\n\n5. Phone Number Verification\nScammers often reuse phone numbers across multiple fake job ads. Check Truecaller for discrepancies.\n\n6. Interview Process\nBe suspicious of job offers that:\n- Require no interviews\n- Guarantee employment\n- Promise automatic salary increases\n\n7. Appointment Letter\nCheck for:\n- Repeated letter templates\n- Similar formatting across different scam advertisements\n\n8. Social Media Reviews\nSearch for public comments about the job or company on social media platforms.\n\n9. Fact-Checking\nSearch online to see if the job has been previously debunked by fact-checking organizations.\n\n10. Submit for Verification\nIf uncertain, submit the job advertisement to fact-checking services like PesaCheck for verification.\n\nFinal Advice: Interrogate job adverts microscopically. If a job looks too good to be true, it probably is a hoax. Never pay for a job opportunity.",
