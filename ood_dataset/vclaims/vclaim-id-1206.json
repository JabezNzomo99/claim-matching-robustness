    "full_text": "'Missed Call Campaign' Number For BJP Goes Viral As Pro-UCC Drive\n\nClaim:\nSocial media campaign, urging Hindus to give a missed call to 9090902024 as a mark of support for UCC.\n\nFact:\nNo such pro-UCC drive, missed call campaign was part of BJP's mega outreach programme ahead of the 2024 general elections to mark its nine years in power.\n\nSeveral social media users are circulating what appears to be a campaign for the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), urging Hindus to give a missed call to 9090902024, so as to indicate their consent for UCC. \"Already in two days 4 crore Muslims and 2 crore Christians have voted against UCC. Therefore, before the deadline, 6th July, all Hindus in the country are requested to vote in favour of the UCC. Please give missed call on 9090902024 to support UCC and save the country (sic),\" read a Whatsapp forward.\n\nFact Check:\nNewschecker ran a keyword search for \"UCC missed call 909090204\", which did not throw up any credible news reports of such a campaign.\n\nWe, however, came across multiple news reports, including from India Today, NDTV, and Economic Times, explaining that the missed call number (9090902024) was part of BJP's month-long mass connect drive to mark the Narendra Modi government's ninth anniversary.\n\nThe India Today report from May 31, 2023, stated: \"In the run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has launched a unique 'missed call' campaign with a special number: 9090902024. This initiative aims to expand the party's support base and is reminiscent of the membership drive conducted by the party in 2019.\"\n\nWe gave a missed call to the number, which resulted in an SMS thanking us for supporting the Modi government and directing us to a website focusing on the nine years of the Narendra Modi government.\n\nWhy Discussion Around UCC?\nThe BJP has reportedly initiated a discussion in the party and the country on the UCC after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke of the need for it. The UCC, which relates to a common law pertaining to marriage, divorce, inheritance, maintenance and succession of property for citizens of all religions, has been part of BJP's manifesto since the inception of the party.\n\nConclusion:\nA missed-call campaign that was part of a month-long mass connect drive to mark the Narendra Modi government's ninth anniversary has gone viral as a pro-UCC movement.\n\nResult: False",
