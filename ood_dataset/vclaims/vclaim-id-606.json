Ma returned the rented car on July 3 and left the country shortly after for Hong Kong, then Macao,\" CNA said.\n\nIt said that police found traces of blood in both the vehicle and Ma's hotel room in Bangkok.\n\nEfforts are now underway to locate and bring Ma back to Thailand for interrogation.\n\nHowever, Noppasil recently addressed reports suggesting Yan's disappearance was linked to a crime syndicate, saying that there may have been misunderstandings in her communications with family members.",
