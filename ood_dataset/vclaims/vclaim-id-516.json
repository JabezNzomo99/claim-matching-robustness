    "full_text": "Baltimore Bridge Collapse: What Happened and What Needs To Change\n\nWhen the container ship MV Dali, 300 metres long and massing around 100,000 tonnes, lost power and slammed into one of the support piers of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, the bridge collapsed in moments.\n\nSix people are presumed dead, several others injured, and the city and region are expecting a months-long logistical nightmare in the absence of a crucial transport link.\n\nIt was a shocking event, not only for the public but for bridge engineers like me. We work very hard to ensure bridges are safe, and overall the probability of being injured or worse in a bridge collapse remains even lower than the chance of being struck by lightning.\n\nHowever, the images from Baltimore are a reminder that safety can't be taken for granted. We need to remain vigilant.\n\nSo why did this bridge collapse? And, just as importantly, how might we make other bridges more safe against such collapse?\n\n1. A 20th Century Bridge Meets a 21st Century Ship\n\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge was built through the mid 1970s and opened in 1977. The main structure over the navigation channel is a \"continuous truss bridge\" in three sections or spans.\n\nThe bridge rests on four supports, two of which sit each side of the navigable waterway. It is these two piers that are critical to protect against ship impacts.\n\nAnd indeed, there were two layers of protection: a so-called \"dolphin\" structure made from concrete, and a fender. The dolphins are in the water about 100 metres upstream and downstream of the piers. They are intended to be sacrificed in the event of a wayward ship, absorbing its energy and being deformed in the process but keeping the ship from hitting the bridge itself.\n\nThe fender is the last layer of protection. It is a structure made of timber and reinforced concrete placed around the main piers. Again, it is intended to absorb the energy of any impact.\n\nFenders are not intended to absorb impacts from very large vessels. And so when the MV Dali, weighing more than 100,000 tonnes, made it past the protective dolphins, it was simply far too massive for the fender to withstand.\n\nVideo recordings show a cloud of dust appearing just before the bridge collapsed, which may well have been the fender disintegrating as it was crushed by the ship.\n\nOnce the massive ship had made it past both the dolphin and the fender, the pier \u2013 one of the bridge's four main supports \u2013 was simply incapable of resisting the impact. Given the size of the vessel and its likely speed of around 8 knots (15 kilometres per hour), the impact force would have been around 20,000 tonnes.\n\n2. Bridges Are Getting Safer\n\nThis was not the first time a ship hit the Francis Scott Bridge. There was another collision in 1980, damaging a fender badly enough that it had to be replaced.\n\nAround the world, 35 major bridge collapses resulting in fatalities were caused by collisions between 1960 and 2015, according to a 2018 report from the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure. Collisions between ships and bridges in the 1970s and early 1980s led to a significant improvement in the design rules for protecting bridges from impact.\n\nThe International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering's Ship Collision with Bridges guide, published in 1993, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' Guide Specification and Commentary for Vessel Collision Design of Highway Bridges (1991) changed how bridges were designed.\n\nIn Australia, the Australian Standard for Bridge Design (published in 2017) requires designers to think about the biggest vessel likely to come along in the next 100 years, and what would happen if it were heading for any bridge pier at full speed. Designers need to consider the result of both head-on collisions and side-on, glancing blows. As a result, many newer bridges protect their piers with entire human-made islands.\n\nOf course, these improvements came too late to influence the design of the Francis Scott Key Bridge itself.\n\n3. Lessons From Disaster\n\nSo what are the lessons apparent at this early stage?\n\nFirst, it's clear the protection measures in place for this bridge were not enough to handle this ship impact. Today's cargo ships are much bigger than those of the 1970s, and it seems likely the Francis Scott Key Bridge was not designed with a collision like this in mind.\n\nSo one lesson is that we need to consider how the vessels near our bridges are changing. This means we cannot just accept the structure as it was built, but ensure the protection measures around our bridges are evolving alongside the ships around them.\n\nSecond, and more generally, we must remain vigilant in managing our bridges. This tragic event only emphasises the need to spend more on maintaining our ageing infrastructure. This is the only way to ensure it remains safe and functional for the demands we put on it today.",

This information is true. \n\nA container ship, MV Dali, lost power and slammed into one of the support piers of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, the bridge collapsed in moments, leaving at least six presumed dead and several others injured.\n\nRead our report here:",
    "vclaim": "The Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore collapsed when the container ship MV Dali lost power and crashed into one of its support piers, resulting in six presumed deaths and significant regional disruption. The bridge's protective measures, including dolphin structures and fenders, were insufficient to handle the impact of modern massive cargo ships like the MV Dali, which weighed over 100,000 tonnes. Ship collisions with bridges have led to improved design rules and safety standards since the 1990s, but these came too late to influence the 1970s-era Francis Scott Key Bridge design. The incident highlights the need to update bridge protection measures to account for increasingly larger modern vessels and maintain aging infrastructure to meet current demands.",
