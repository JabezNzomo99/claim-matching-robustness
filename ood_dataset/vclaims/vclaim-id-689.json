And when his daughter visited Delhi in 1960-61, she stayed at Teen Murti House with Nehru and Indira Gandhi\n\nJawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, charismatic stalwarts of the Congress and the Indian struggle for Independence, were comrades, not adversaries.\n\nIn June 1935, when the former was imprisoned in India, his wife Kamala needed to go to Europe for treatment of tuberculosis. Bose, who had been exiled to Europe by the British, unsurprisingly took charge by accompanying her from Vienna to Prague where she was to receive initial medical care.\n\nWith Kamala's condition deteriorating, the British permitted Nehru to join her. She was moved to Badenweiler, a Black Forest resort in Germany. Bose messaged Nehru: \"If I can be of any service in your present trouble, I hope you will not hesitate to send for me.\" Eventually Kamala was shifted to Lausanne in Switzerland, where she prematurely passed away in 1936 in the presence of her husband, daughter Indira and Bose.\n\n[The full article continues in this detailed narrative, exploring the personal and political relationship between Nehru and Bose, including their correspondence, political differences, and mutual respect. The text highlights their complex relationship, showing how personal ties often transcended political disagreements.]\n\nThe article concludes with a touching detail about Bose's daughter Anita staying at Nehru's residence during her visit to India in 1960-61, symbolizing the enduring personal connection between the two leaders.",
