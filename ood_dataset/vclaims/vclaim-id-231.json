Fine for not wearing a seat belt is `1,000.\n\nA senior police officer said that by law it is mandatory for passengers travelling in a car to wear a seat belt. However, the rule was relaxed for passengers seated in the rear.\n\nEarlier this month, Nitin Gadkari, the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, had stressed on the importance of wearing seat belts and had said that rear seat passengers not wearing a seat belt would be penalised.\n\nThe move was in view of the fatal accident that occurred recently in Palghar district of Maharashtra that took the life of former chairperson of Tata Sons Cyrus Mistry and another co-passenger on September 4. They were reportedly not wearing seat belts.\n\nDirections have been issued by the Centre on implementing the safety seat belt rule. Police said that safety belts are essential in ensuring safety of occupants of vehicles and as per the Motor Vehicle Act, it is mandatory to use safety belts.\n\nPolice said that whoever drives a motor vehicle without wearing a seat belt or carries passengers not wearing safety belt shall be punishable with a fine of `1,000.\n\nMeanwhile, during a special drive conducted from September 14 to September 25, the Goa traffic police prosecuted 7,620 motorists for various violations. Police said that during the special drive, 701 cases of over-speeding, 101 cases of drunken driving, 2,271 cases of riding without helmet, 676 cases of driving without seat belt and 3,871 cases of dangerous parking were booked.\n\nPolice have appealed to all the road users, drivers and riders, particularly the young people, to drive/ride safely and responsibly and obey all the traffic rules.",
