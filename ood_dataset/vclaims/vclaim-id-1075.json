    "full_text": "Why does diabetes occur?\n\nAs stated by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disorders, type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system of your body attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. According to the scientists, type 1 diabetes is caused due to genes and environmental factors, such as viruses that might trigger the disease.\n\nType 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. It can be caused due to several reasons including lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, insulin resistance and genes, and family history. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, which is caused due to hormonal changes during the period as well as genetic and lifestyle factors.\n\nPredisposing Factors for Different Types of Diabetes:\n\nType 1 Diabetes:\n- Family history\n- Environmental factors\n- Presence of damaging immune system cells (autoantibodies)\n- Geographic location (higher rates in countries like Finland and Sweden)\n\nPrediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes:\n- Being overweight\n- Minimal to no physical activity\n- Family history\n- PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)\n- High blood pressure\n- Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels\n- Higher risk in Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Asian American communities\n\nAdditional Risk Factors:\n- Development of gestational diabetes during pregnancy increases risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes\n\nThe development of diabetes can lead to symptoms like weight loss, which can serve as an early warning sign. Understanding how diabetes affects metabolism can help individuals better manage these changes.",

Type 2 diabetes, the most common form, is caused by a combination of lifestyle factors like physical inactivity and obesity, along with genetic predisposition. Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy due to hormonal changes, genetic factors, and lifestyle factors. Different ethnic groups, particularly Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Asian American communities, have higher risks of developing type 2 diabetes. Risk factors for diabetes include family history, geographic location, PCOS, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, and previous gestational diabetes.",
