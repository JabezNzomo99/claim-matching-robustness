The post also claims that Bishop Johanan Wagyara of the church has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nNewschecker team received several requests on our WhatsApp Helpline (+91 9999499044) for fact-checking this claim.\n\nThe claim is viral on both Twitter and Facebook.\n\nFact Check/ Verification\n\nOn a quick verification, Newschecker found that the social media posts, claiming raids on Kerala Believers Eastern Church, was shared extensively earlier in November, 2020 as well.

    "vclaim": "Social media posts falsely claim that \u20b97000 crores were seized in IT raids on Kerala Believers Eastern Church. Posts incorrectly identify Bishop K.P. Yohannan as Bishop Johanan Wagyara and falsely claim he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate. The actual IT raid occurred in November 2020 and recovered approximately \u20b96 crores, not \u20b97000 crores as claimed in viral posts.",
