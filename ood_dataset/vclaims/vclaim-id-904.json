However, in cases where there are genuine problems of pensioners to visit the bank, it is the duty of bank officers to visit them, and take life certificate, and update them on the system as per the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs,\" the High Court said.\n\nJustice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order on a petition filed by H. Nagabhushana Rao, a resident of Malleswaram, who is a recipient of honorary freedom fighters' pension from both the Central and State governments since 1974.  \n\nThe court directed the Ministry to pay within two weeks the arrears of \u20b93.71 lakh with 6% interest per annum from December 2018. The interest payable would become 18% per annum if arrears are not released within two weeks, the court said.\n\nAs the petitioner was 97 when the bank stopped pension for non-submission of life certificate, the court said that bank officers should have visited the pensioner as per the guideline and regulated his pension.\n\n\"The pensioners could be septuagenarians, octogenarians, nonagenarians or centenarians, like the petitioner. Therefore, this order cannot be construed to be a sweeping direction in all cases where the life certificate has to be secured by the bank officers. But in genuine cases, bank officers ought to perform their duty in terms of the guidelines so as to avoid unnecessary litigation of the kind that has been generated, not once or twice, but three times,\" the court observed.  \n\nBackground of case:\nMr. Rao's pension from the Central government, paid through Canara Bank, was stopped in November 2017, as he had failed to submit his annual life certificate as per the law in 2017 due to ebbing mental prowess and physical incapacity due to age. He submitted the certificate in December 2018. As the bank did not restore his pension, he moved the court in 2020 and the court ordered release of pension.  \n\nThough his pension was restored, the arrears of \u20b93.71 lakh for 2017-2018 were not paid, forcing him to move the court again in 2021. The court, in 2022, directed the bank and the Ministry to consider payment of arrears as per the guidelines. However, the Ministry granted arrears of only one month instead of 13 months leading him move court with another petition. \n\nThis time, the Ministry said that the fault lies with the bank for stopping pension without verification about the pensioner as per the guidelines.",

    "vclaim": "A 102-year-old freedom fighter pensioner had to approach court three times due to pension payment issues, leading to the High Court imposing a \u20b91 lakh cost on a bank and the government. The High Court directed the Centre to pay \u20b93.71 lakh in arrears with 6% interest to the pensioner within two weeks. The court ruled that bank officers should visit elderly pensioners in genuine cases when they cannot submit life certificates within the deadline. The pensioner's payments were stopped in November 2017 due to non-submission of life certificate, which he couldn't submit due to age-related physical and mental limitations. Despite court orders in 2020 and 2022, the Ministry only paid one month's arrears instead of 13 months, forcing the pensioner to file multiple petitions.",
