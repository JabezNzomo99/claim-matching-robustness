    "full_text": "No-frills gear and Olympic silver: Turkish shooter, 51, is internet sensation\n\nA 51-year-old Turkish shooter has gone viral on social media after a photo of him competing in the 10m air pistol mixed team event final with limited gear was shared widely. Yusuf Dikec, unlike many other professional shooters, was wearing only his glasses and had his hand in his pocket as he shot silver.\n\nIn shooting events, the shooters wear a lot of gear, including specialised glasses for better precision and avoid any kind of blurring and ear-protectors for noise cancellation. However, Yusuf Dikec flaunted his aura as he went on to win a silver medal at the Paris Olympic Games. Shooting fans on social media went berserk and the 51-year-old was viral all over the internet.\n\nDikec, alongside his partner Sevval Ilayda Tarhan, took second place in the 10-meter air pistol mixed team event. Although Dikec brought limited gear to the competition, that would not stop him from Olympic glory.\n\nThe 51-year-old wore regular prescription glasses and earplugs and was still able to defeat most of the competition. He rolled up the line with one hand in his pocket, aimed his pistol down sight and nailed his shots as he and Sevval Ilayda Tarhan secured a silver medal in the event.\n\nThe 51-year-old shooter from Turkey is competing in his fifth Olympic Games, with his first appearance coming in Beijing in 2008. He managed to win his first-ever Olympic medal in the most comfortable style after a decorated career with the pistol.\n\nThe final of the shooting event went down to the wire with Serbia producing a thrilling comeback to secure the gold medal. Zorana Arunovic and Damir Mikec recovered from being down 8-2 to secure the victory with a 16-14 score over Dikec and Tarhan. This was the same match where India's Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh bagged the bronze medal.",
