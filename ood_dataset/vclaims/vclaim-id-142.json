    "full_text": "Risk of new heart problems jumps after Covid; mRNA shot side effects no different for cancer patients\n\nLong after recovery from Covid-19, people face significantly higher risks for new heart problems, a large study has found.\n\nResearchers at the US Department of Veterans Affairs compared rates of new cardiovascular problems in 153,760 individuals infected with the coronavirus before vaccines were available, 5.6 million people who did not catch the virus, and another 5.9 million people whose data was collected before the pandemic.\n\nAn average of one year after their recovery from the acute phase of the infection, the Covid-19 survivors had:\n- 63% higher risk for heart attack\n- 69% higher risk for problematic irregular heart rhythm\n- 52% higher risk of stroke\n- 72% higher risk of heart failure\n- Nearly three times higher risk of a potentially fatal blood clot in the lungs\n\nThese elevated risks were evident across diverse populations, including:\n- Young and old\n- Blacks and whites\n- Males and females\n- People with and without diabetes\n- People with and without kidney disease\n- Smokers and nonsmokers\n\nZiyad Al-Aly of the VA St. Louis Health Care System emphasized that the risks were high even in people who had mild Covid-19 and did not require hospitalization. He advised Covid-19 patients to monitor their health and seek medical care if experiencing symptoms like chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or leg swelling.\n\nThe study also examined mRNA vaccine side effects in cancer patients, finding no additional short-term side effects compared to non-cancer patients. Researchers surveyed 1,753 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine recipients and found similar rates of side effects across both groups.\n\nAdditionally, the research explored the Omicron variant's unique cell infection method, which differs from earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, potentially explaining its milder symptom profile.",

    "vclaim": "People who recovered from COVID-19 face significantly higher risks for various heart problems, including heart attacks, irregular heart rhythm, strokes, heart failure, and blood clots, compared to those who never had COVID-19. The elevated cardiovascular risks after COVID-19 infection were observed across diverse populations regardless of age, race, gender, and pre-existing conditions. Even mild cases of COVID-19 that didn't require hospitalization showed increased risks of cardiovascular problems. Cancer patients experienced similar rates of side effects from mRNA vaccines compared to non-cancer patients. The Omicron variant has a unique cell infection method different from earlier variants, which may explain its milder symptoms.",
