    "full_text": "On May 9, 2023, Adamu Garba, a former presidential aspirant and a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), posted a picture of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of APC and Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP).\n\nHe posted the picture on his Twitter page with the caption:\n\n\"Tinubu's posture: No food for a lazy man like you Peter Obi, stop sleeping everywhere including at courts and airports, hero beer have overtaken your wakefulness, go for deliverance.\n\nWhat a lovely brotherly advice.\"\n\nClaim: Picture shows Peter Obi receiving \"brotherly advice\" from Tinubu\n\nVerification:\n\nThe CDD Election War Room fact-checked the claim and discovered that the picture has been doctored. Using a Google reverse image search, we found the original picture to be that of Yemi Osinbajo, the vice president of Nigeria, and Peter Obi. The duo met at the funeral service for the father of Duoye Diri, Bayelsa state's governor on May 7, 2023.\n\nThis video shows that Peter Obi arrived at the event while other dignitaries such as Olusegun Obasanjo, Goodluck Jonathan, Yemi Osinbajo, Dolapo Osinbajo, and Atiku Abubakar, were already seated. He, thereafter, went to their seat to exchange pleasantries. It was while exchanging pleasantries that this picture was taken and later edited to replace Osinbajo with Tinubu.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe claim is false while the image attached to the tweet has been doctored. The original image captures Yemi Osinbajo and Peter Obi exchanging pleasantries, not Obi taking brotherly advice from Bola Tinubu.",
