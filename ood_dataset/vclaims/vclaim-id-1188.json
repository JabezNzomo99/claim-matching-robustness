Also not part of BJP's mega outreach program for 2024 general elections.\n\nSeveral social media users are circulating a message requesting Hindus to give a missed call on 9090902024 to express support for Uniform Civil Code (UCC). The message claims that in just two days, 4 crore Muslims and 2 crore Christians have voted against UCC. Therefore, before the deadline of 6th July, all Hindus are being requested to vote in support of UCC. \"Please give a missed call on 9090902024 to support UCC and save the country.\"\n\nNewschecker searched for \"UCC missed call 909090204\" but found no reliable news reports about such a campaign.\n\nHowever, a May 31, 2023 India Today report titled \"BJP Launches Unique Missed Call Campaign Ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha Elections\" was found.\n\nThe report states that BJP launched a unique missed call campaign with the number 9090902024, aiming to expand party support, similar to the membership drive in 2019.\n\nThe mobile number represents Modi government's nine years and the crucial 2024 Lok Sabha election year. BJP strategically chose this number while seeking a renewed mandate.\n\nSimilar reports were found in Economic Times and NDTV, describing this as BJP's mass connect program to mark nine years in power and prepare for the 2024 elections.\n\nWhen Newschecker made a missed call, they received an SMS thanking them for supporting the Modi government and linking to a website about the government's nine years.\n\nConclusion: The claim about a missed call campaign supporting UCC is false. No such campaign is being conducted.\n\nResult \u2013 False\n\nSources:\n- India Today report, May 31, 2023\n- NDTV report, May 31, 2023\n- BJP press release, May 30, 2023\n- BJP official website\n- BJP webpage about mass connect drive",
