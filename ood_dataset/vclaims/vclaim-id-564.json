This new artificial-intelligence-enabled wearable lets you access the power of AI models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.0 and Google's Gemini, plus a mix of others, wherever you are with a simple tap of the finger. My mom learned about it by watching her routine Indian news\u2014a testament to the far-reaching buzz that Humane's first product has generated.\n\nShe naturally wanted to see it in action, and I was happy to oblige. She was cooking in the kitchen, so I tapped on the Ai Pin and said, \"Look and tell me what this is.\" It took a glance at what was in front of me using its onboard camera, then told me I was staring at lettuce. (Correct!) My mom asked me to peel a cucumber, so I tapped the device to wake it up, then asked, \"Do you need to peel a cucumber?\" The Pin said it's unnecessary unless the skin has been waxed or you plan to cook with it. My mom said she was making fish molee, so I asked the Pin what it was and, to our surprise, it understood and answered:\n\nFish Molly, also known as Fish Molee, is a Kerala-style fish stew made with coconut milk, coconut oil, curry leaves, green chilies, and lemon juice. It is a mildly spiced and creamy dish that is popular in Kerala cuisine.\n\nThis went on for a bit, but I increasingly began to doubt the accuracy of the information the Humane wearable was providing. My mom told me to avoid high-fructose corn syrup right as my dad handed me a bottle of Malta Goya\u2014she said the sweetener in it was banned in California. The Ai Pin agreed with this when I asked it. However, California did not ban it; the state banned four food additives last year, none of which are high-fructose corn syrup.\n\n[The review continues with a detailed, critical analysis of the Humane Ai Pin's features, functionality, and limitations, ultimately giving the device a rating of 4/10.]\n\nThe key takeaway is that while the Humane Ai Pin shows potential, the current version is severely limited, with numerous issues including:\n- Unreliable information accuracy\n- Difficult-to-use projector interface\n- Thermal overheating problems\n- Limited functionality\n- Lack of essential features\n- Awkward interaction methods\n\nThe reviewer concludes that while excited about the technology's potential, the current product is not ready to replace a smartphone and feels more like a \"party trick\" than a practical device.",

    "vclaim": "The Humane Ai Pin is a new AI-enabled wearable device that allows users to access various AI models like ChatGPT 4.0 and Google's Gemini through voice commands. The device can identify objects through its camera and provide information, but its accuracy is questionable as demonstrated by incorrect information about high-fructose corn syrup bans in California. The reviewer gave the Humane Ai Pin a 4/10 rating due to multiple issues including unreliable information, thermal problems, limited functionality, and awkward user interface.",
