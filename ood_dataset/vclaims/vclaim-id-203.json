    "full_text": "Viral Forward Claiming SC Has Set Up A Committee To Oversee Freebies Given By Governments Is False\n\nA text message claiming that the Supreme Court has ordered the formation of a body called 'All India taxpayers organisation' to oversee & regulate 'freebies' by political parties ahead of polls, is going viral on social media & WhatsApp. Newschecker found this claim to be untrue.\n\nFact Check/Verification\n\nWe started our investigation by conducting a keyword search on Google with the words \"Supreme Court\", \"panel\" and \"freebies\" and found an article by the Times of India uploaded on 4th August, 2022 titled 'Supreme Court to set up expert panel on freebies, blames Election Commission for laxity'.\n\nAccording to the article, on August 3, the Supreme Court proposed creating a specialized body made up of individuals who can \"dispassionately\" assess the issue of freebies provided to voters during elections.\n\nThe article stated that the Supreme Court decided to set up an expert group with representation from Niti Aayog, Finance Commission of India, the Law Commission, Reserve Bank of India, Opposition, etc., who must participate in the process of ideation to address the issue of freebies and produce actionable recommendations.\n\nA bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Krishna Murari and Hima Kohli asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, Election Commission Counsel Amit Sharma, Petitioner's counsel Vikash Singh and Vijay Hansaria along with senior advocate Kapil Sibal to suggest the ideal composition of such a panel, which will contour on scrutiny of freebies and give suggestions to the government and posted the matter for hearing on August 11.\n\nThe expert panel will analyse the adverse effects freebies have on the economy of the country and provide its recommendations to the Government which will take into account the suggestions.\n\nNewschecker found that there is no mention of any committee called the All India Organisation of Taxpayers committee, which is claimed to be a body whose sanction would now be required to give freebies like free electricity, water, loan waivers etc. as claimed in the viral post.\n\nThere is also no mention of the Government approving the blueprint of their schemes through the committee before announcing them.\n\nThis proves that such a committee is still in the proposed stage and the final orders on the subject are yet to come out.\n\nConclusion\n\nNewschecker's investigation revealed that the claim that the Supreme Court has set up an All India taxpayers organisation to oversee and regulate the 'freebies' offered by the Government or other political parties is false. The Supreme Court has asked several senior advocates along with members of the ECI to form an expert panel which will offer their suggestions on the adverse effects the freebies have on the economy of the country.\n\nResult: False",

    "vclaim": "A viral message claims that the Supreme Court has established an 'All India taxpayers organisation' to regulate freebies given by political parties before elections. The Supreme Court has only proposed creating an expert panel to assess the issue of election freebies, but no committee has been officially formed yet. The viral message falsely states that government schemes need approval from an 'All India taxpayers organisation' before being announced.",
