    "full_text": "Update (04 September 2024):\nThe same video is being widely shared on social media, claiming it shows details of the Congress manifesto for the 2024 Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections. However, as debunked in the article below, the video discusses the CPI(M)'s manifesto for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. As of the writing of this article, the Congress Party has not yet released its manifesto for the 2024 Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections.\n\nPublished (08 May 2024):\nA video showing a man allegedly reading out the Congress manifesto is being widely shared across social media platforms. The claim accompanying the post suggests that the Congress party, in their 2024 Lok Sabha election manifesto, has stated that if they form the government, they will restore Article 370, repeal the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the New Education Policy (NEP), anti-conversion laws, the National Security Act (NSA), and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Additionally, they will abolish the death penalty, exit from QUAD and I2U2, and eliminate all nuclear weapons from the country. In this article, let's fact-check the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: The 2024 Congress manifesto states that if they form the government, they will restore Article 370, repeal the CAA, the New Education Policy, anti-conversion laws, the NSA, and the UAPA, they will remove the death penalty, withdraw from QUAD and I2U2, and eliminate all nuclear weapons from the country.\n\nFact: The Congress manifesto for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections does not mention the repeal of the CAA, anti-conversion laws, the NSA, or the UAPA. However, senior Congress leader and former Union Finance Minister Chidambaram stated that they will repeal the CAA once the I.N.D.I.A bloc comes to power, even though it is not explicitly mentioned in its manifesto. The Congress manifesto also does not mention the removal of the death penalty or the elimination of nuclear weapons from India. The Congress party stated that they will amend the new education policy after consultation with the states. While the Congress party stated that they will restore the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir, it does not explicitly mention its plans to restore Article 370. Notably, all the claims mentioned in the viral post are from the CPI(M)'s 2024 Lok Sabha elections manifesto. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nThe article then goes on to detail the fact-check for each claimed point in the viral video, concluding that the video actually discusses the Communist Party of India (Marxist) CPI(M)'s 2024 Lok Sabha elections manifesto, not the Congress party's manifesto.\n\nTo sum up, this video doesn't talk about the Congress manifesto for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, it instead discusses the CPI(M) manifesto.",

    "title": "This is False. The Congress manifesto for the 2024 Jammu & Kashmir elections does not mention the repeal of the CAA, anti-conversion laws, the NSA, or the UAPA. Similar claims went viral during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections as well.\n\nAll the claims mentioned in the viral post are from the CPI(M)\u2019s 2024 Lok Sabha elections manifesto.",
    "vclaim": "A viral video falsely claims that Congress's 2024 manifesto promises to restore Article 370, repeal various laws including CAA, NEP, anti-conversion laws, NSA, and UAPA, abolish death penalty, exit QUAD and I2U2, and eliminate nuclear weapons. The viral video actually discusses the CPI(M)'s 2024 Lok Sabha elections manifesto, not the Congress party's manifesto. The Congress manifesto does not include most of these claimed promises, though they have separately stated intentions to repeal CAA and amend education policy.",
