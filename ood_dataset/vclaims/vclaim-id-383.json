    "full_text": "FACT SHIELD: All you need to know about off-cycle elections in Nigeria\n\nFollowing the release of the timetable for off-cycle elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), political parties and their political actors in Nigeria kicked off plans and activities for the elections. The off-cycle elections will take place in Bayelsa, Imo, and Kogi states.\n\nSubsequently, political parties held primary elections and presented their gubernatorial candidates to the public. Many people are unsure why 24 states held gubernatorial elections during the general election while eight others have separate gubernatorial election timetables.\n\nWhat is an Off-cycle Election?\n\nOff-cycle elections in Nigeria refer to elections held outside the general election schedule. In Nigeria, the regular election cycle holds every four years, with general elections for the presidency, National Assembly, and state governors held in the same year. However, off-cycle elections are held when there is a need to fill a vacant position due to death, resignation, impeachment, or other reasons.\n\nOff-cycle elections are held on a different date from the general election. While the majority of states in the country elected their governors in the general election, not all states participated. These states are assigned a different timetable to elect their governors. In Nigeria, states participating in off-cycle elections include Bayelsa, Kogi, Anambra, Imo, Osun, Ondo, Edo and Ekiti.\n\nWhy do the states have a different election timetable?\n\nAt the return of democracy in 1999, every state of the federation was conducting its elections simultaneously until some candidates, displeased with the 2003 elections' outcome, approached the court to reclaim their mandate. In separate rulings across the states where results were challenged, the election petition tribunal called for the removal of some governors and scheduled a fresh election in some states. This was how the off-cycle elections came to be.\n\n[The rest of the article continues with detailed explanations of how each state (Anambra, Bayelsa, Edo, Ekiti, Kogi, Ondo, Osun, and Imo) became an off-cycle election state, describing the specific legal challenges and court cases that led to changes in their election schedules.]\n\nConclusion\n\nPeter Obi's case was unprecedented\u2014 as he spent three years (2003 to 2006) in court to reclaim his mandate. Thereafter, he got impeached, approached the court and was eventually reinstated. He won his reelection and governed Anambra state till the end of his tenure in March 2014. This signified that every candidate can approach the court, if not satisfied with the electoral umpire's result.\n\nAt the end of the 2007 general elections, about six states approached the election tribunal to overturn the decision of the electoral umpire and called for fresh elections. For the states where the opponents won in court, they went on to conduct fresh elections and eventually created the \"off-cycle election\" pattern.",

    "title": "Gubernatorial polls were held in only 28 states of the federation during Nigeria\u2019s last general elections. Consequently, eight states were left out of the general elections thus leading to the off-cycle elections which would subsequently be held.\nCurrently, preparations are being made for the off-cycle elections that will take place in Imo, Kogi, and Bayelsa states on November 11, 2023. \nThere has been no reports on postponement as at the time of this response.",
    "vclaim": "Off-cycle elections in Nigeria are elections held outside the general election schedule, currently affecting eight states: Bayelsa, Kogi, Anambra, Imo, Osun, Ondo, Edo and Ekiti. The off-cycle election pattern in Nigeria emerged when some candidates challenged the 2003 election results in court, leading to tribunal rulings that removed some governors and scheduled fresh elections in certain states. Peter Obi's case in Anambra was a significant example where he spent three years in court (2003-2006) to reclaim his mandate, was impeached, reinstated, and completed his tenure in 2014. Following the 2007 general elections, approximately six states approached election tribunals to contest results, leading to fresh elections that established the current off-cycle election pattern.",
