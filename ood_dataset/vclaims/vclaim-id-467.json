    "full_text": "Nitrogen tyre inflation in cars: Advantages and disadvantages\n\nThe tyres are the only contact patch between your car and the road surface. Hence, they play a vital role in the handling and ride quality of the vehicle. Tyre pressure is one of the factors that impact the physical condition of the tyres. If you own/drive a car, you must have noticed people filling nitrogen in tyres. So, what is the use of filling nitrogen gas in tyres?\n\nBenefits of filling nitrogen gas in tyres:\n\nNitrogen is a non-toxic, non-flammable, tasteless, odourless and colourless inert gas, forming about 78% of the earth's atmosphere.\n\nAdvantages of filling nitrogen in tyres include:\n\n1. Reduces running temperature: Nitrogen helps reduce the running temperature of car tyres, enhancing tyre life.\n\n2. Increases tyre life: Filling nitrogen enhances tyre life by reducing operating temperature and slowing tyre wear.\n\n3. Stable temperature: Nitrogen is more stable than compressed air, with a moderate temperature rise during heat cycles.\n\n4. High temperature performance: Nitrogen-filled tyres offer stable pressure range irrespective of temperature, reducing explosion risks.\n\n5. No rusting: Unlike oxygen, nitrogen does not react with metal wheel rim components, preventing oxidation.\n\n6. Enhances fuel efficiency: Nitrogen escapes slower than oxygen, maintaining tyre pressure and reducing engine stress.\n\n7. Improves ride quality: Nitrogen retains tyre pressure effectively, improving overall handling and comfort.\n\n8. Increased safety: Stable pressure range makes nitrogen-filled tyres safer compared to air-filled tyres.\n\nDisadvantages of nitrogen tyre inflation:\n\n1. Expensive: Nitrogen inflation costs more than free normal air.\n\n2. Maintenance challenges: Cannot mix nitrogen with normal air, or it loses beneficial properties.\n\n3. Limited availability: Not easily found at all fuel stations or tyre shops.\n\nCost of nitrogen filling:\n- Topping up: Around Rs. 10 per tyre\n- First-time filling: Around Rs. 40-50 per tyre\n\nComparison with normal air:\nNitrogen offers advantages in pressure retention, temperature stability, and tyre wear. However, the differences may be minimal in practical usage.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile nitrogen has several benefits, the choice depends on individual preferences, cost considerations, and availability. Both nitrogen and normal air can be used effectively for tyre inflation.",

    "title": "It seems that this message is a hoax that has been circulating on social media and WhatsApp for a long time. It contains several false and misleading claims about tyre pressure, tyre bursts, and nitrogen gas.",
    "vclaim": "Nitrogen-filled tires reduce running temperature and enhance tire life by slowing wear compared to regular air-filled tires. Nitrogen maintains more stable tire pressure across temperature changes and reduces explosion risks compared to compressed air. Unlike oxygen, nitrogen doesn't cause rusting of metal wheel components and escapes more slowly, leading to better fuel efficiency. While nitrogen inflation offers benefits for tire performance and safety, it is more expensive and less readily available than regular air.",
