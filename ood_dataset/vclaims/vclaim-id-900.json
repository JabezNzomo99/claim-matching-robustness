    "full_text": "Narayana Murthy clarifies on Facebook: Gave no speech on PM Narendra Modi\n\nInfosys co-founder Narayana Murthy has taken to social-networking platform Facebook to clarify that he has not given any speech on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nIn a post on his Facebook account, IT industry luminary Murthy wrote, \"I have been receiving several messages from friends and colleagues about a supposed speech with my name on it. I am told this has been circulating over WhatsApp. Since I am not able to reply to everybody individually I am posting my response here. While I have respect for the PM, as evinced in my various interviews over the past couple of years, this message/speech is fake. This style of prose is not reflective of how I think, write, or speak.\"\n\nWhile participating in a debate on 'intolerance' in the Lok Sabha recently, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said, \"People like Narayana Murthy, Raghuram Rajan and P M Bhargava are among the many protesting... They are disturbed like millions of other people. Respect them and try to understand what is disturbing them. Go and listen to them.\"\n\nMurthy had recently expressed concerns that there is considerable fear in the minds of minority in India and said that the governments should bring back the sense of confidence in them.\n\n\"I am not a politician, I am not interested in politics, therefore, I don't want to comment on that but the reality today is that there is considerable fear in the minds of minority in India,\" he said.\n\nHe said that there was also \"considerable fear\" in the minds of people of one region living in another region.\n\nNo country, the IT veteran said, has ever made steady economic progress unless \"there is no distrust, there is no fear, unless the majority community doesn't oppress the minority community, doesn't want the minority community to do what it wants etc.\"",
