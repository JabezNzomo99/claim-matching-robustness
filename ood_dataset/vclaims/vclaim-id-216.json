Here's A Fact-Check Of Viral Post\n\nClaim: Tata builds new Parliament in 17 months and at a cost of just \u20b91 to the government\n\nFact: Tata Projects won the contract to build new Parliament building with a \u20b9861.90-crore bid, construction is still going on after it started from January 2021\n\nA post, claiming that the upcoming new Parliament house was built in merely 17 months by Tata at a cost of just \u20b91 to the government, is doing the rounds of social media and Whatsapp. Several social media users are hailing the \"record feats\" as Tata's gift to the nation. The viral posts come on the heels of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the new Parliament building, where he spent over an hour inspecting the site and interacting with workers.\n\nFact check:\n\nNewschecker first ran a keyword search for \"Tata parliament building \u20b91\", which did not throw up any credible news reports. We, however, came across multiple news reports of how Tata Projects, in September 2020, won the contract to construct a new Parliament building at a cost of \u20b9861.90 crore.\n\nThe new Parliament building will be constructed close to the existing one under PM Modi's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project. Similar reports confirming Tata's winning bid of \u20b9861.90 crore can be seen in various news sources.\n\nRegarding the construction timeline, news reports indicate that the construction of the triangular-shaped new Parliament building began in January 2021, with an initial deadline of November 2022. The foundation stone was laid by PM Modi in December 2020.\n\nAccording to a Times of India report, the project was initially targeted for completion in November last year. However, construction work has exceeded the \"17-month\" mark stated in the viral claim.\n\nConclusion:\n\nViral post falsely claims that Tata is building the new Parliament building at a cost of just \u20b91 to the government and construction was completed in 17 months. Newschecker learnt that Tata Projects won the contract to build a new Parliament building with a \u20b9861.90-crore bid, while construction is still going on after it started from January 2021.\n\nResult: False\n\nSources:\n- Mint report, September 16, 2020\n- Economic Times report, September 17, 2020\n- Centralvista.gov.in\n- Indian Express report, January 23, 2023\n- Times of India report, January 10, 2023",
