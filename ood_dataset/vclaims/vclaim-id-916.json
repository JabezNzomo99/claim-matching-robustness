    "full_text": "Station Master 'Sharif' Absconding Since Odisha Train Accident? No, False Claim Viral Post Train Mishap\n\nClaim:\nStation Master Sharif is on a run since the tragic three-way train accident near Bahanaga Bazar railway station in Odisha's Balasore.\n\nFact:\nNo staff or station master named Sharif is posted at the Bahanaga Bazar railway station. South Eastern Railway CPRO confirmed that no staff has been absconding, and everyone is cooperating in the ongoing investigation into the cause of the accident.\n\nDetailed Fact Check:\n\nA multi-train collision near Bahanaga Bazar railway station in Odisha's Balasore district last week killed at least 278 people and left over 1000 injured. Several social media users have claimed \"station master Sharif, who was responsible & posted where the Koramondal (Coromandel) Express collided, is missing.\" Users sharing the post further alleged \"Intelligence agencies suspect Bangladeshi & Rohingya angles plus ISI and Manipur.\"\n\nVerification Process:\n- A keyword search revealed a report by Odisha Bhaskar dated June 5, 2023, which stated that the Railway Safety Commissioner team is currently interrogating Bahanaga Bazar Station Master SB Mohanty over the Coromandel train accident.\n\n- A video report by India Today, also dated June 5, 2023, identified SB Mohanty as the station master on duty on the day of the multi-train accident.\n\n- South Eastern Railway's Chief Public Relations Officer Aditya Kumar Chaudhary explicitly stated: \"Fake news is going on at some places that railway workers have absconded, there is nothing like that, all the workers are in touch with us. Everything is being done as per process.\"\n\n- When directly contacted, CPRO Chaudhary confirmed that there is no staff or station master named Sharif posted at the Bahanaga Bazar railway station, and no staff is absconding.\n\nAdditional Context:\nRailway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had previously stated that the accident \"happened due to a change in electronic interlocking.\" The investigation is ongoing, and there are no grounds to claim the incident was a result of sabotage.\n\nConclusion:\nThe viral post claiming that a station master named Sharif has been absconding since the multi-train collision in Odisha's Balasore is false.\n\nResult: False\n\nSources:\n- Odisha Bhaskar Report, June 5, 2023\n- India Today Video Report, June 5, 2023\n- Times Of India Report, June 5, 2023\n- Telephonic Conversation with South Eastern Railways CPRO Aditya Kumar Chaudhary on June 6, 2023",
