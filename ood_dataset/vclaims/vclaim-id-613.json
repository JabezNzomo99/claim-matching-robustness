    "full_text": "Major airlines, medical facilities, businesses and police forces around the world were hit by a massive information technology glitch Friday, with Microsoft computers around the world showing \"Blue Screens of Death.\"\n\nThe cybersecurity company CrowdStrike said Friday that the outages were the result of a routine software update gone wrong, \"not a security incident or cyberattack.\"\n\nCrowdStrike, which provides cybersecurity services and software for many large corporations that use Microsoft systems, later issued a new software update that automatically fixed some computers. But others must be manually restarted and patched, causing huge delays.\n\nMicrosoft announced late Friday morning that its 365 apps and services had recovered, and CrowdStrike said a fix had been deployed early in the morning. But some frozen computers couldn't receive CrowdStrike's automatic update, leading to some of the problems lingering into the weekend.\n\nMany flights were delayed as of Friday afternoon. Starbucks locations in New York had resumed normal wait times, despite its mobile order-ahead feature still not working.\n\nThe glitch brought chaos to a number of key institutions and businesses around the world that may take some time to clear up.\n\nMany flights were grounded across the globe, and stores and broadcasters in several countries went offline. According to FlightAware, the tech glitch was responsible for more than half of the U.S.'s 1,352 flight delays and cancellations before 8 a.m. ET on Friday.\n\nMajor carriers, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, all issued ground stops Friday morning citing communications issues. Passengers traveling to the United States from as far away as Japan had their flights canceled. Delta ordered a \"global ground stop.\"\n\nGeorge Kurtz, president and CEO of CrowdStrike, said the problems could persist.\n\n\"It could be some time for some systems that just automatically won't recover,\" he told NBC's \"TODAY\" show on Friday.\n\nKurtz said the company was \"deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this,\" adding the issue had been fixed on its end.\n\nThe outage affected numerous sectors globally:\n\n- In Europe, Berlin's Brandenburg Airport and airports in Spain reported technical delays\n- Paris' airport authority noted potential disruptions ahead of the Olympics\n- In Israel, at least 15 major hospitals were affected\n- Alaska State Troopers reported 911 and non-emergency phone numbers were not working\n- News outlets like Sky News and NBC News experienced broadcasting issues\n- The UK's National Health Service reported problems with appointment and patient record systems\n- Manchester United delayed a ticket release due to Microsoft issues\n- The London Stock Exchange faced technical problems\n\nKurtz warned about potential exploitation of the situation, encouraging people to remain vigilant and only engage with official CrowdStrike representatives.\n\nThe incident underscores the interconnected nature of global technology systems and the potential widespread impact of a single software update error.",

The outage severely disrupted global air travel, with multiple major airlines issuing ground stops and causing numerous flight delays and cancellations. Critical infrastructure and services were affected worldwide, including hospitals in Israel, emergency services in Alaska, broadcasting networks, healthcare systems in the UK, and various financial institutions. While CrowdStrike deployed a fix and Microsoft 365 services recovered, some systems required manual intervention, causing problems to persist into the weekend.",
