    "full_text": "Here is the extracted content from the fact-check article in Telugu:\n\nClaim: Adani Group companies pay one lakh crore rupees in taxes to the Indian government every year.\n\nFact (Truth): The IBEF did not state that Adani companies pay one lakh crore rupees in taxes annually. Adani companies are not even on the list of companies paying the highest taxes to the government. In the 2022 financial year, the total tax paid by seven listed Adani companies was less than 5,000 crore rupees. Companies like Reliance, TCS, SBI are in the top ranks of tax-paying companies. Therefore, the post's claim is false.\n\nKey Points:\n\n1. IBEF Claims:\n- In a December 2022 media interview, Adani stated that their business entities would contribute 1 trillion dollars to India's GDP every 12-18 months.\n- IBEF shared this news clip, but clarified they are not responsible for any misinterpretations.\n\n2. Top Tax-Paying Companies:\n- According to an Ace Equity report, 15 companies paid at least 5,000 crore rupees in taxes in 2022.\n- Reliance paid the highest at 16,297 crore, followed by SBI at 13,382 crore, and TCS at 13,238 crore.\n- Adani companies are not in the list of top 15 tax-paying companies.\n\n3. Adani's Tax Contribution:\n- Seven listed Adani companies collectively paid around 4,000 crore rupees in taxes.\n- For example, Adani Enterprises Ltd paid 477 crore rupees, and Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd paid 746 crore rupees in 2021-22.\n\n4. Corporate Tax in India's GDP:\n- In 2022-23, corporate taxes contributed 8.35 lakh crore rupees, which is less than 3% of the total GDP.\n- Corporate taxes constitute less than 30% of the central government's total tax revenue.\n\nConclusion: The claim that Adani companies pay one lakh crore rupees in taxes annually is completely false.",
