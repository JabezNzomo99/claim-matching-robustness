Through this article let's fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Dr. Rajendra Badwe, Tata memorial hospital stated that hot coconut water kills cancer cells.\n\nFact: Tata Memorial Hospital had issued a clarification saying that the viral message was not made by Dr. Rajendra Barwe and that there is no scientific data to suggest that hot coconut water can cure any type of cancer.
