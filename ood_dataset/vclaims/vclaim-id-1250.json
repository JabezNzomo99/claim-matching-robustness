    "full_text": "Fact Check: Viral Video Does Not Show Chaos After Cloudburst In Delhi; Here's The Truth\n\nAmidst the heavy rains in Delhi-NCR, a video is widely circulating on social media showing a crowd running in panic. It's being claimed that chaos followed a cloudburst incident in Delhi.\n\nThe title on the video reads: \"11 \u0938\u093f\u0924\u0902\u092c\u0930 2024 \u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u093e\u0926\u0932 \u092b\u091f\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0905\u092b\u0930\u093e\u0924\u092b\u0930\u0940\" (English translation: \"11th September, 2024 Chaos due to cloudburst in Delhi\")\n\nThe above post can be seen on Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms.\n\nFACT CHECK\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the claim, and found it to be misleading.\n\nRunning the viral video keyframes through Reverse Image Search, the NM team came across a YouTube video, dated August 3, 2024, on an unverified channel. The description of the video states that it shows protests taking place in Venezuela in 2024.\n\nSearching further, we found another video similar to the viral video on the X handle of Monitoreamos, a Venezuelan media house. The video was uploaded on July 30, saying that it was a demonstration held in Puerto La Cruz city of Venezuela.\n\nThe same video was also uploaded on another Venezuelan media house's Instagram handle around the same time, confirming that the video is from Venezuela.\n\nAdditionally, there have been no official reports of a cloudburst in Delhi-NCR. Instead, multiple reports confirm heavy rainfall across the region. (These reports can be seen from various news sources.)\n\nBased on the findings, we can conclusively say that the viral video claiming to show chaos following a cloudburst in Delhi is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 11 7127 9799.",
