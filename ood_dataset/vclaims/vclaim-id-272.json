    "full_text": "False Claim About Biden's Win Probability\n\nQuick Take:\nFacebook posts have repeated a false claim about a \"one in a quadrillion\" chance that President-elect Joe Biden received more votes than President Donald Trump in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Experts told us the claim misuses a questionable statistical analysis that made implausible assumptions about the 2020 election.\n\nFull Story:\nA failed lawsuit seeking to have the U.S. Supreme Court invalidate election results in four battleground states that Biden won makes false claims about the improbability of Biden's victory. At least one of those claims is now being repeated on Facebook.\n\nThe claim originated from a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, which stated that the probability of Biden winning the popular vote in these four states was less than one in a quadrillion. The claim was based on an expert declaration by economist Charles J. Cicchetti.\n\nHowever, experts pointed out several critical flaws in this statistical analysis:\n\n1. The analysis made unrealistic assumptions about voter populations and ballot counting.\n\n2. The \"one in a quadrillion\" probability does not actually reflect the true likelihood of Biden's victory.\n\n3. The vote count pattern was entirely expected due to:\n- Different voting methods (in-person vs. mail-in ballots)\n- COVID-19 impact on voting\n- State laws restricting early mail-in ballot counting\n- Higher mail-in ballot usage among Democratic voters\n\nMultiple experts, including Stanford University's Justin Ryan Grimmer and UC Berkeley's Philip B. Stark, criticized the analysis as fundamentally flawed. They emphasized that the vote counting process was transparent and followed established procedures.\n\nKey facts supporting the legitimate vote count:\n- Democrats were more likely to vote by mail\n- Mail-in ballots from urban, Democratic-leaning counties were counted later\n- Biden consistently outperformed Hillary Clinton's 2016 results\n- The vote shift was anticipated and not indicative of fraud\n\nThe claim of a statistically impossible election result is false and does not withstand scientific scrutiny.",

    "vclaim": "Social media posts falsely claimed there was a \"one in a quadrillion\" chance that Joe Biden legitimately won more votes than Donald Trump in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's lawsuit used flawed statistical analysis with unrealistic assumptions to challenge Biden's victory in four battleground states. The observed vote count patterns were actually expected due to differences in voting methods, COVID-19 impact, state counting laws, and Democratic voters' preference for mail-in ballots.",
