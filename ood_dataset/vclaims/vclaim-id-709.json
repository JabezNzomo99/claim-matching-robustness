    "full_text": "Grant nod to install Ganesha idol after obtaining local jamath consent: HC\n\nThe Madras High Court has directed the Coimbatore police to grant permission to install a Ganesha idol at a housing board colony predominantly inhabited by Muslims, after obtaining consent from the local Jamath.\n\nJustice N Sathish Kumar gave this direction on August 26 while disposing of a criminal original petition filed by Mahalakshmi, who sought permission to install a Ganesha Idol at Pullakadu Housing Unit in Ukkadam South and celebrate the Vinayaka Chaturthi festival scheduled for August 31.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, the residents in the housing colony want to celebrate Vinayaka Chaturthi and other community people are willing to participate in the celebrations. They have even agreed to offer annadhanam (food distribution) to the devotees.\n\nThe Additional Public Prosecutor argued that the area is predominantly surrounded by the Muslim community and there could be a law and order problem. However, the petitioner's counsel submitted that the local Jamath people are willing to participate in the celebrations and have no objections.\n\nThe judge permitted the petitioner to file an affidavit/undertaking before the police station along with an affidavit from the Jamath Committee to install the Vinayakar idol and conduct the Chaturthi festival on August 31, strictly following the guidelines prescribed under the Government Order dated August 9, 2018 of the Public (Law & Order) department.\n\nThe judge clarified that the petitioner shall install the Vinayaka idol inside their housing unit only and celebrate the function. No procession shall be taken out with the idol. The police were directed to ensure proper protection upon receiving the undertaking.",
