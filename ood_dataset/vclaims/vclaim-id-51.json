Instead, it seems to be a homepage or listing of multiple fact-check articles from PesaCheck. The HTML shows previews and snippets of various fact-checks, but not the complete text of any single fact-check.\n\nIf you would like me to extract the text from a specific fact-check, could you provide the HTML for the full article page? I'm prepared to carefully parse the content according to the guidelines you outlined, removing HTML tags while preserving the investigative narrative and factual details.",
