The release had advised the people not to share photocopies of their Aadhaar with any organization because they can be misused. Alternatively, a masked Aadhaar which displays only the last 4 digits of Aadhaar number, can be used, it said.\n\nThe Centre has now withdrawn the advisory in view of the possibility of the misinterpretation of the press release, the same stands withdrawn with immediate effect. Aadhaar card holders have been advised to exercise normal prudence in using and sharing their UIDAI Aadhaar numbers.\n\nThe now-withdrawn advisory went viral on social media platforms on Sunday, with several users claiming that most organisations would not conduct verification services without a physical copy of the Aadhaar card.\n\nSome users also shared screenshots of a 2018 conversation between a Twitter user and then outgoing Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) chairperson R S Sharma.\n\nSharma had then, to showcase the safety and privacy features of Aadhar, put out his Aadhaar number on Twitter and said that he would see if any harm befell him.\n\nIn the latest advisory, the MeitY said UIDAI-issued Aadhaar card holders are only advised to exercise normal prudence in using and sharing their UIDAI Aadhaar numbers.\n\nIn its previous release, the government had warned people not to use public computers at internet cafes to download their Aadhaar cards. \"If you do so, please ensure that you delete all the downloaded copies of e-Aadhaar permanently from that computer,\" the government advisory had said.",
