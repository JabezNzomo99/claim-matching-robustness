    "full_text": "Update (08 July 2023): The Law Commission of India has also issued a disclaimer notice stating that certain phone numbers circulating on social media, which are erroneously linked to the Uniform Civil Code, are not associated with them. Individuals can express their views on the Uniform Civil Code by visiting the website of the Department of Legal Affairs or by sending an email to the Law Commission of India.\n\nIn light of PM Modi's recent remarks strongly advocating for the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and criticizing opposition parties for allegedly inciting minority communities against it, a post is circulating widely on social media platforms claiming that Hindus who wish to express their support for the UCC should give a missed call to '9090902024' before 06 July 2023. Let's verify the accuracy of this claim.\n\nClaim: Hindus who wish to express their support for the Uniform Civil Code should give a missed call to '9090902024' before 06 July 2023.\n\nFact: The Government of India has not launched any missed call initiative for expressing support or opposition to the Uniform Civil Code. Individuals can share their views on the UCC on website of Department of Legal Affairs or by sending e-mail to Law Commission of India. Moreover, the number '9090902024' is linked to a BJP campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha Polls, where users can give a missed call to show support for the nine years of the Modi Government. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThrough an internet search using relevant keywords, it has been found that the number '9090902024' is associated with a campaign called 'Jan Sampark se Jan Samardhan' launched by the BJP in preparation for the 2024 Lok Sabha Polls. The campaign urged users to give a missed call to this number to demonstrate their support for the nine years of the BJP Government.\n\nMoreover, to verify the assertion, we tested it ourselves by giving a missed call to the number '9090902024'. Upon doing so, we received a message in response expressing gratitude for extending support to the 9 years of the Modi Government. This confirms that the number is indeed associated with the campaign mentioned earlier and not related to the Uniform Civil Code (UCC).\n\nHowever, the Law Commission of India issued a public notice on 14 June 2023 on the Uniform Civil Code and sought comments from the general public, political parties, and others on UCC over the next 30 days. Individuals who are interested and willing to express their views on the matter can do so by either presenting their opinions here or by sending an email to the Law Commission of India at membersecretary-lci@gov.in.\n\nTo sum it up, the Government of India has not launched any initiative involving giving a missed call to express support or opposition to the Uniform Civil Code.",

    "vclaim": "A viral social media post claims Hindus should give a missed call to '9090902024' before July 6, 2023, to express support for the Uniform Civil Code. The number '9090902024' is actually associated with BJP's 'Jan Sampark se Jan Samardhan' campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha Polls, not the Uniform Civil Code. The Law Commission of India has clarified that phone numbers circulating on social media are not associated with the Uniform Civil Code consultation process. Citizens can only submit their views on the Uniform Civil Code through the Department of Legal Affairs website or by emailing the Law Commission of India.",
