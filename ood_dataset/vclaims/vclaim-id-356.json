    "full_text": "ANI claims Canada Issued Travel Advisory Urging 'High Degree Of Caution' While Traveling To India, Canadian Embassy Refutes 'News'\n\nClaim:\nCanada has updated its travel advisory to India, warning travellers of 'unpredictable situation' in Jammu and Kashmir amid diplomatic standoff.\n\nFact:\nCanadian Embassy in New Delhi has confirmed that the advisory cautioning against travel to Jammu & Kashmir is not new, and has remained unchanged since at least July 2021.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statement referring to 'allegations' that India played a role in the murder of Canadian citizen and Khalistani sympathiser Hardeep Singh Nijjar is snowballing into a major controversy and threatening to cast more strain on the New Delhi-Toronto ties.\n\nIn wake of the episode, Indian news agency ANI shared a post on social media platform X on September 19, 2023, claiming that the Canadian government has issued a fresh travel advisory to its citizens travelling to India, warning of the 'unpredictable situation in Jammu and Kashmir', highlighting \"terrorism, militancy, civil unrest and kidnapping\". The agency also published a news item on its website carrying the same claim.\n\nFact check/Verification:\nNewschecker began by looking up the website of the Canadian government's travel advisory to India and noticed that the last updated version of the page was on September 18, 2023. The section on Jammu and Kashmir was titled \"Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir \u2013 Avoid all travel\" and further read \"Avoid all travel to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir due to the unpredictable security situation. There is a threat of terrorism, militancy, civil unrest and kidnapping. This advisory excludes travelling to or within the Union Territory of Ladakh.\"\n\nThe website also informed that the latest update was regarding health: \"Latest updates: The Health section was updated \u2013 travel health information (Public Health Agency of Canada)\".\n\nBy checking archived versions of the page on archive.org, Newschecker found that the page had been archived multiple times, with the text under the Jammu and Kashmir section remaining unchanged since at least July 2021.\n\nThe High Commission of Canada based in New Delhi confirmed to Newschecker that the update on Jammu and Kashmir is not recent. \"The updated Travel Advisory of September 18 was only for the health section update. The risk level and regional advisories did not change,\" they were informed.\n\nConclusion:\nThe assertion made by news wire ANI regarding Canada's updated travel advisory amid tensions between India and Canada is False. This information has been in place since July 27, 2021 and is not a recent development.\n\nResult: False",
