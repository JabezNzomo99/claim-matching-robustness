    "vclaim": "A video showing Muslim men calling for boycott of Hindu businesses is falsely claimed to be from Bengaluru, when it actually occurred in Barmer, Rajasthan in 2019. The speech in the video was made by a relative of a person who died in a bus accident, and was not a general call for boycott of Hindu businesses. The Barmer police took action against the person making the speech and filed an FIR against the bus driver involved in the fatal accident.",
