    "vclaim": "Social media posts falsely claimed that Asle Toje, a Nobel Committee member, stated Prime Minister Modi is the chief contender for the Nobel Peace Prize. Due to Nobel Prize nomination secrecy rules, committee members cannot disclose nominees for 50 years. During his visit to India, Toje made general remarks about peace and India's growing importance but did not specifically endorse Modi for the Nobel Peace Prize.",
