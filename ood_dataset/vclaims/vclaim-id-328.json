    "full_text": "Explainer: India's Rice Export Ban\n\nOn July 20, 2023, the Indian government imposed a ban on the export of non-Basmati white rice to \"ensure adequate domestic availability at reasonable prices.\" Domestic prices of rice have been steadily increasing \u2014 by 11.5% over the past year and 3% over the past month \u2014 according to a statement by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution.\n\nIndia is currently the world's largest rice exporter, accounting for more than 40% of global rice shipments. 25% of those exports are of non-Basmati white rice. In 2022, rice shipments from India were recorded at 22.2 million tons. Heavy rains in northern India have inundated rice paddy fields, destroying newly planted seedlings that farmers can only replant once the water recedes from the fields, causing a shortage in rice production.\n\nWhy has India enacted a ban on rice exports?\n\nThe government cited domestic and international reasons for imposing the ban, rising international prices owing to geopolitical events, changes in El Nino weather patterns, and \"extreme climate conditions\" in other rice-producing countries.\n\nIn September 2022, India imposed a 20% export duty on non-Basmati white rice to ensure domestic availability of the crop. Despite the additional export duty, exports of non-Basmati white rice increased by 33%. Therefore, to keep prices affordable in the domestic market, India has imposed a ban on non-Basmati white rice.\n\nIndia has explicitly stated that only the export of non-Basmati white rice is being halted. Exports of Basmati rice and par-boiled rice will continue.\n\nWhat does this entail?\n\nAccording to researchers, India's rice ban will likely lead to higher global prices and food insecurity.\n\nSeveral countries in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa rely on rice imported from India, making them most vulnerable to the export ban. India exports rice to more than 140 countries, with 42 countries getting more than 50% of their total rice imports from India. While countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan are also major rice producers, they cannot fully compensate for the absence of Indian rice in the global market.\n\nThe price of 5% broken parboiled rice in India, Thailand, and Vietnam has also shot up. Additionally, Russia's war in Ukraine and the decision to pull out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative have added to current and future concerns about global food insecurity. The Initiative allowed the resumption of Ukrainian grain and edible oil exports to global markets.\n\nHow does this affect the average consumer?\n\nThe price of white rice per metric ton in the U.S. has jumped from USD $330 at the beginning of Sept. 2022 to $455 as of July 19, 2023.\n\nThis isn't the first time India has imposed a ban on rice exports; in response to previous global food shortages and soaring prices, India implemented similar bans in 2007-2008 and 2010-2011.\n\nDoes President Biden have anything to do with this?\n\nSome Americans have tweeted their frustration at the price hike in grocery items, comparing it to lower prices during Donald Trump's presidency. While it is true that the price of rice is significantly higher at the moment than it was while Trump was president, the ban's enforcement is not directly related to President Biden's policies.\n\nThe ban's primary objective is to safeguard India's domestic markets. The ban's impact stretches beyond the U.S., affecting numerous nations heavily reliant on Indian rice exports.",

The move impacts global rice prices, potentially leading to food insecurity, affecting countries heavily dependent on Indian rice imports.",
    "vclaim": "India banned the export of non-Basmati white rice in July 2023 to ensure adequate domestic availability and control rising prices. India's rice export ban was triggered by factors including domestic price increases, heavy rains damaging crops, and global geopolitical events. The ban specifically targets non-Basmati white rice while allowing exports of Basmati and parboiled rice to continue. India's rice export ban is expected to cause higher global prices and food insecurity, particularly affecting countries in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The price of white rice in the U.S. has increased significantly from $330 to $455 per metric ton between September 2022 and July 2023. Claims linking the rice export ban to President Biden's policies are false, as the ban is primarily related to India's domestic market protection.",
