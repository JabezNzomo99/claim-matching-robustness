She works two jobs \u2014 a morning stint at a hair-dresser, and an evening shift at a restaurant \u2014 and couldn't find a window to get inoculated.\n\n\"I didn't have any time,\" Santiago, 19, a native of El Salvador, said Saturday at the Joseph P. Addabbo Health Center in Far Rockaway, while she waited to get her first vaccine shot. \"I work from 8 a.m. until midnight.\"\n\nIt is a familiar predicament across much of the City. Vaccination rates in some neighborhoods with high foreign born populations have lagged behind the city average for various reasons \u2014 including tight work schedules, fears of adverse reactions, rampant misinformation fortified by the geographical isolation of some communities like Far Rockaway, and a shortage of inoculation sites.\n\nDespite aggressive efforts to encourage incoulatons, vaccination rates in one zip code on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens still trail well far behind the City's norm.\n\nThe Edgemere and Far Rockaway zip code of 11691, has the lowest vaccination rate in the City. Here, only about 34 percent of individuals of all ages are vaccinated, city data shows, compared to more than 55 percent citywide. Vaccination rates in this swath of the Rockaway Peninsula even lag behind the numbers in Alabama, the state with the lowest percentage of fully vaccinated people in the nation (35.02%), according to the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center.\n\nFar Rockaway has become emblematic of the many hurdles hindering vaccination efforts in low-income urban neighborhoods with significant immigrant populations. Roughly one-third of the almost 70,000 residents of zip code 11691 are foreign born, mostly from Latin America, according to U.S. census data. The median household income in zip code 11691, on the eastern side of the Rockaway Peninsula, is about $50,000 \u2013 about $14,000 less than the average NYC household income.\n\nBy contrast, the average household income is almost $106,000 in Breezy Point, on the peninsula's western flank. There, in zip code 11697, about 79 percent of residents are fully vaccinated, far above the city average.\n\nIn recent weeks, community activists, lawmakers and others have made a renewed push to bolster inoculations in the Far Rockaway area. \"We're at a pivotal moment in this fight \u2014 we don't want to go back to where we were last year,\" Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said Thursday, during a visit to Far Rockaway with other officials aimed at encouraging residents to get vaccinated. \"Reminder \u2014 Far Rockaway shut down. Reminder \u2014 bodies upon bodies at our hospitals.\"\n\nFar Rockaway is \"this little microcosm of New York City,\" said Miriam Vega, the Chief Executive Officer of the Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center, a major community health hub which has locations in Rockaway, Southeast Queens and Brooklyn. \"The issues that New York City faces as a whole, they are extremely punctuated there.\"\n\nThe key to increasing vaccinations, immigrant advocates say, is to quell fears about the shot, and boost the availability of appointments and accurate information. Often, this means walking the streets and seeking out residents.\n\nFor months, advocacy groups have been aggressively pitching vaccines in immigrant communities. They've translated paperwork into Spanish and other languages, hired bilingual health-care workers and dispatched buses with vaccine teams to every borough, while expanding vaccination periods to weekends and after-work hours. Advocates have also been posted outside vaccination sites, seeking to allay fears and reminding people that neither lack of health insurance or uncertain immigration status hinders eligibility.\n\n\"Continuing to keep trusted messengers at the forefront of the outreach is essential,\" said Ellie Alter, the COVID-19 outreach coordinator for Make the Road New York, an advocacy organization that has been setting up clinics to help immigrants and others get vaccinated throughout the city. \"And to take a more sort of deep-canvassing approach where we understand that these are ongoing conversations that require multiple touches.\"\n\n(The full text continues in this manner, providing a detailed exploration of vaccination challenges in the Far Rockaway area, focusing on immigrant communities, their concerns, and efforts to increase vaccination rates.)",

    "title": "Misinformation and a fear of missing out on work are preventing residents from getting the COVID-19 vaccine in the geographically isolated neighborhood of Far Rockaway, Queens.",
    "vclaim": "Far Rockaway's zip code 11691 has the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rate in New York City at 34%, significantly below the citywide average of 55%. Work schedules, fear of side effects, misinformation, geographical isolation, and limited vaccination sites are major barriers to vaccination in immigrant communities like Far Rockaway. There is a stark vaccination rate disparity between Far Rockaway (34%) and nearby Breezy Point (79%), which correlates with significant differences in household income. Community organizations and officials are actively working to increase vaccination rates through multilingual outreach, mobile vaccination units, and extended vaccination hours.",
