I was just aiming for a weekend with the kids.'\"\n\nThe 52-year-old, who works as a mechanic in a small garage in Istanbul, first picked up a gun during a particularly frustrating divorce mediation. His unorthodox approach \u2014 no specialty gear, no training regimen, and a wardrobe consisting of his everyday jeans and a T-shirt \u2014 has baffled professional shooters. \"He just shows up, shoots a near perfect round, and then asks if there's a smoking area nearby.\"\n\nAfter winning silver, Yusuf stood emotionless on the Olympic podium and declared, \"Sharon, if you're watching this, I want my dog back.\"\n\nThe above post can be seen on Facebook, which has been shared over 29 thousand times.
