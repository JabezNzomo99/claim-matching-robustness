    "full_text": "Lord Shiva Statue Unveiled\n\nOn 18 June, CERN unveiled an unusual new landmark, a 2m tall statue of the Indian deity Lord Shiva.\n\nThe statue is a gift from India, celebrating CERN's long association with India which started in the 1960's and continues strongly today. It was unveiled by the Director General, Dr Robert Aymar, His Excellency Mr K. M. Chandrasekhar, Ambassador (WTO-Geneva) and Dr Anil Kakodkar, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Secretary, Dept of Atomic Energy, India.\n\nIn the Hindu religion, this form of the dancing Lord Shiva is known as the Nataraj and symbolises Shakti, or life force. As a plaque alongside the statue explains, the belief is that Lord Shiva danced the Universe into existence, motivates it, and will eventually extinguish it. Carl Sagan drew the metaphor between the cosmic dance of the Nataraj and the modern study of the 'cosmic dance' of subatomic particles.\n\nThe statue was made in India. The original sculpture was a wax model, around which a soil mould was made. Melting the wax left a hollow into which liquid metal was poured. Once cooled, the mould was split and the statue polished and given its antique finish.\n\nThe statue is on permanent display in the square between buildings 39 and 40, a short distance from the Main Building.",

    "vclaim": "CERN unveiled a 2-meter tall statue of Lord Shiva, gifted by India, on June 18th to celebrate their long-standing partnership since the 1960s. The Nataraj form of Lord Shiva in Hindu religion symbolizes life force and is believed to dance the Universe into existence, maintain it, and eventually destroy it. Carl Sagan compared the cosmic dance of Nataraj to the modern understanding of subatomic particle behavior. The statue was created in India using the lost-wax casting method and is permanently displayed between buildings 39 and 40 near CERN's Main Building.",
