Many users took to microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to report about the issue. Windows users are seeing blue screen errors on their screen with the laptop/PC getting stuck on restart loop.\n\nThe outage has disrupted operations of several airlines, banks, broadcasting and emergency services across the world.\n\nMicrosoft has acknowledged the issue on its service status page.\n\nUS-based security giant CrowdStrike too said in a post on Reddit that outage is result of 'faulty update' that has now been rolled back. \"We have widespread reports of BSODs on windows hosts, occurring on multiple sensor versions.\" \"[We have] identified a content deployment related to this issue and reverted those changes,\" it said in the post.\n\nSo it is not clear which, if any, of the outages are related to the CrowdStrike problem or issue at Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft outage: Impact in India\nThe disruption in Microsoft's services have impacted industries worldwide including airlines, banks and others. Indian airlines including Spicejet, Akasa Airlines and Air India Express. The Microsoft Cloud outage has resulted in flight cancellation and delays.\n\n\"We're currently facing a technical issue in providing updates on flight disruptions. Our team is actively working to resolve this issue. We regret for any inconvenience caused and will update you once the issue is resolved. Thank you for your patience and co-operation,\" Spicejet said.\n\nIndigo updated: \"As our systems are impacted by an ongoing issue with Microsoft Azure, we are experiencing high volumes at contact centre. Please contact us only if your travel is within 24 hrs.\"\n\nIT minister on Microsoft outage\nIT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has responded to the global outage. \"MEITY is in touch with Microsoft and its associates regarding the global outage. The reason for this outage has been identified and updates have been released to resolve the issue. CERT is issuing a technical advisory,\" wrote Vaishnaw. The IT minister clarified that the NIC network has not been impacted by the outage. \"NIC network is not affected,\" added Vaishnaw.\n\nWhat Microsoft's live service page reads?\nMicrosoft 365 Admin page shows 'Service degradation', implying that users may not be able to use Microsoft 365 apps and services.\n\nPreliminary root cause: A configuration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads, caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.\n\nWhat is Microsoft doing about the issue\nCurrent status on Microsoft service status website: We remain committed in treating this event with the highest priority and urgency while we continue to address the lingering impact for the remaining Microsoft 365 apps that are in a degraded state.\n\nIn a post on X, Microsoft 365 Status wrote that the company is \"investigating an issue impacting users ability to access various Microsoft 365 apps and services\". \"We're working on rerouting the impacted traffic to alternate systems to alleviate impact in a more expedient fashion,\" it said in another post adding \"We remain focused on redirecting the impacted traffic to healthy systems\".\n\nWhat X users are saying\n\"Windows Crashed...! It seems everyone around the globe facing this issue.. wahhhh please don't resolve. Take ur own time @Microsoft,\" wrote one user.\n\n\"Windows down. P1 everywhere. There goes my weekend,\" said another.\n\n\"Did anyone else's #Windows11 laptop suddenly encounter a #BSOD and crash? Happened for me and a lot of my colleagues!\" wrote a third.\n\nWhy are you seeing blue screen errors on your Windows laptop\nReportedly, the issue is occurring after installing a Crowdstrike update. For those unaware, Crowdstrike is a cybersecurity company that offers a cloud-based platform for security.\n\n\"Crowdstrike customers that are using windows are experiencing blue screens this morning. The issue is in the Falcon sensor and was introduced by an update over night. Crowdstrike is aware of it and working on it,\" wrote a user on X.\n\n\"Crowdstrike falcon is causing windows blue screen of death - issue across aws and azure,\" a second user posted on X.\n\n\"If you're getting a blue screen issue on your windows 10 PC. And stuck on a restart loop, don't worry. You're not alone. Worldwide issue apparently due to some CrowdStrike update,\" another user wrote.",
