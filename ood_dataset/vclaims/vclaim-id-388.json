    "full_text": "FACT SHIELD: Muri, Yahaya and Restraining Orders\n\nThere is a viral message circulating on various social media platforms claiming that a federal high court has issued an injunction preventing all security agencies in the country from apprehending or detaining Murtala Ajaka, the gubernatorial candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Kogi State. This has raised questions regarding why a restraining order was issued to protect a political aspirant and the circumstances that led to such an order. The CDD War Room has compiled a comprehensive timeline of events for clarity.\n\nBackground\n\nMurtala \"Muri\" Ajaka is the candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) for the upcoming gubernatorial election scheduled for November 11 in Kogi State. Although he professes that he is of the \"Kogi Agenda,\" his critics have alleged that he is more associated with the \"Igala Agenda.\" Prior to securing the SDP nomination, he held a prominent position within the All Progressives Congress (APC) and had previously served as the national deputy publicity secretary of the All Progressives Party (APC). Despite being political allies with Yahaya Bello in the past, he was barred from participating in the APC primaries on the morning of the election.\n\nTimeline\n\n\u2013 In June 2023, Muri reported a purported assassination attempt on his life in Korton Kafe, situated along Lokoja Road. He alleged that the attack was sponsored by an unnamed high-ranking politician. Conversely, there are reports that Yahaya Bello accused Muri and his team of masterminding an attack on his convoy.\n\n\u2013 In July 2023, Muri asserted that security operatives, acting on the orders of Yahaya Bello, had invaded his home in Abuja. The state government disassociated itself from these allegations and advised Ajaka to resolve any issues he had with security operatives. \n\nIn the same month, Muri approached a federal high court in Abuja, expressing concerns about his personal safety and, through a motion ex-parte and an affidavit of urgency, requesting the court to protect his fundamental rights, including the right to life, personal dignity, personal liberty, fair hearing, freedom of expression, and peaceful assembly. Yahaya Bello was identified as the 1st Respondent, with the Nigeria Police Force, the Inspector-General of Police, the Commissioner of Police (Kogi State Command), the Department of State Services, and its Director General, the Director of DSS (Kogi State Command), the Commandant General of the Nigeria Security & Civil Defence Corps, the Chief of Defence Staff, the Chief of Army Staff, and the Chief of Naval Staff listed as the 2nd to 11th Respondents.\n\n\u2013 In July, Femi Falana, a human rights lawyer in Nigeria, submitted a petition to the Inspector General of Police, Olukayode Egbetokun, referring to the assassination attempt on Muri in June. He contended that the assailants were dressed in police uniforms and drove Kogi state official vehicles. He also mentioned the invasion of Muri's Abuja residence and accused the Kogi state governor of employing state and non-state actors to intimidate political opponents.\n\nDecision of the court\n\nThe court found merit in the motion and issued an order that \"restrained the respondents, their agents, servants, and anyone acting on their behalf from arresting, inviting, detaining, or threatening the applicant's life and property pending the hearing and determination of the substantive case.\" The matter was subsequently adjourned. In September 2023, when the case was heard, the federal high court reserved judgement and issued a ruling that continued to prohibit the arrest of the candidate until the final judgement is delivered.\n\nNot a single story\n\nHowever, Muri has been accused by the Kogi State Police Command of making baseless claims about planned attacks against himself and his supporters. Muri in turn issued a statement, alleging that Yahaya Bello was collaborating with security operatives to unleash terror on his supporters. The police command stated that this narrative was spread to tarnish the reputation and integrity of the institution. \n\nIt was also reported that some Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in the state demanded that Muri be declared wanted due to his refusal to comply with invitations from security agencies to answer questions regarding his involvement in political violence.\n\nOther candidates and the restraining order\n\nLeke Abejide, the gubernatorial candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), also sought the court's protection and the enforcement of his fundamental human rights against arrest or detention by Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello.",
