An IEBC audit report shows:\n- Total registered voters for 2022 polls: 22,120,458\n- Diaspora voters: 10,444 (0.05% of total registered voters)\n\n2. IEBC's 2022 voter register for overseas voting includes 12 countries:\n- Tanzania\n- Uganda\n- Rwanda\n- Burundi\n- South Africa\n- South Sudan\n- Germany\n- United Kingdom\n- Qatar\n- United Arab Emirates\n- Canada\n- United States of America\n\nAustralia is NOT on this list.\n\nThe Kenya High Commission in Australia is based in Canberra, not Sydney as claimed in another post.\n\nThe IEBC is the only body mandated to announce final election results in Kenya.\n\nConclusion: PesaCheck finds the claim FALSE.",

    "vclaim": "A false claim circulated on Facebook stating that voting had ended and results were announced at the Kenya High Commission in Australia, with specific vote counts for each candidate. Australia is not among the 12 countries listed in IEBC's 2022 voter register for overseas voting, making it impossible for Kenyans to vote there.",
