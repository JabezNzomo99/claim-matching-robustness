    "full_text": "No longer safe, Parliament may shift to a new building soon\n\nParliament may have a new building in place of the existing 85-year-old heritage structure with Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar giving approval for setting up a high-powered committee to suggest an alternative complex.\n\nLok Sabha secretary general T.K. Viswanathan said that the speaker had given an \"in principle\" approval to set up a committee to go into questions such as the site of alternate complex to house the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and how it will be constructed.\n\nHe said there was need for an alternate complex as the existing building was heavily used and cannot take the strain.\n\n\"Foofalls are increasing...Its heritage character should be preserved.... (There is need to) plan for the future,\" he said.\n\nThe Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had said on Thursday that the Parliament building needs renovation as there were apprehensions of loosening of small ceiling tiles.\n\nViswanathan said composition of the committee will be decided in the next few days but it was likely to be headed by a leading public figure. The committee is likely to have representation from the urban development ministry.\n\nThe Speaker had directed the secretariat to take all possible precautions in the wake of Mantralaya fire in Mumbai.\n\nViswanathan said apart from seeking opinion from CPWD, his secretariat had also made its assessment about the present condition of the building.\n\nThe secretary general, who has accompanied the speaker on some of her visits abroad, said many Parliament buildings were new and had been designed with future requirements in view.\n\nHe said there were suggestions during the discussion on women's reservation bill to increase the seats in Lok Sabha and possibility of increase in strength of Parliament cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe foundation stone of Parliament House building was laid in 1921. Constructed at a cost of Rs.83 lakh, it was inaugurated in January 1927.",

    "title": "Fact: According to an India Today article, the then Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar approved setting up a high-powered committee to suggest an alternative complex for the existing Parliament building. We learnt that the idea was kept on hold then. Also, although Meira Kumar had supported the idea of construction of a new Parliamentary building, the figure Rs 3000 considered to be the then estimated cost of the construction of the new building is fictitious.",
    "vclaim": "Parliament may get a new building as Speaker Meira Kumar approved forming a committee to suggest an alternative complex due to safety concerns with the 85-year-old structure. The CPWD reported that the current Parliament building needs renovation due to concerns about loosening ceiling tiles. The existing building is under strain from heavy use and increasing footfalls, making it necessary to consider an alternative complex while preserving its heritage character. The Parliament House building, which was inaugurated in 1927, was constructed at a cost of Rs.83 lakh with its foundation stone laid in 1921.",
