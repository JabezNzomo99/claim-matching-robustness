    "full_text": "Insect Spy Drone\n\nClaim: A photograph shows an insect spy drone that can take photographs and DNA samples.\n\nRating: Mixture\n\nOne of the current areas of research reportedly being undertaken in the scientific/military field is the development of micro air vehicles (MAVs), tiny flying objects intended to go places that cannot be (safely) reached by humans or other types of equipment. One of the primary military applications envisioned for MAVs is the gathering of intelligence through the surreptitious use of cameras, microphones, or other types of sensors.\n\nSome efforts in MAV research have involved trying to mimic birds or flying insects to achieve flight capabilities not attainable through other means of aerial propulsion. In 2007 a bug-like MAV model with a 3-cm wingspan was displayed at a robotics conference, in 2008 the U.S. Air Force released a simulated video showing MAVs about the size of bumblebees, and in 2012 engineers at Johns Hopkins University were studying the flight of butterflies to help small airborne robots mimic these maneuvers.\n\nThe specific mosquito-like object pictured is just a conceptual mock-up of a design for a MAV, not a photograph of an actual working device \"already in production.\" Although taking DNA samples or inserting micro-RFID tracking devices under the skin of people are MAV applications that may some day be possible, such possibilities currently appear to be speculative fiction rather than reality.\n\nSome technical challenges remain significant. Experts point out that creating robotic insects is technically daunting. As Ronald Fearing, a roboticist at the University of California at Berkeley, noted, \"You can't make a conventional robot of metal and ball bearings and just shrink the design down.\" The rules of aerodynamics change at very tiny scales, requiring precise wing movements that pose huge engineering challenges.\n\nMoreover, even if technical hurdles are overcome, insect-sized flying devices would remain inherently vulnerable - they could easily be eaten by birds or caught in spider webs.\n\nWhile government agencies and private organizations continue research into micro air vehicles, current evidence suggests fully functional insect-sized spy drones remain more theoretical than practical.\n\nSources:\n- Leonard, Tom. \"US Accused of Making Insect Spy Robots.\" The Telegraph, 10 October 2007.\n- Weiss, Rick. \"Washington Abuzz with Talk of Dragonfly Spies.\" The Sydney Morning Herald, 12 October 2007.",

    "vclaim": "A viral image claims to show an insect-sized spy drone capable of taking photos and DNA samples. The pictured mosquito-like object is only a conceptual mock-up, not an actual working device. While micro air vehicles (MAVs) are being researched by military and scientific organizations, fully functional insect-sized spy drones face significant technical challenges and remain theoretical. Current research includes efforts to mimic birds and flying insects for MAV development, with some prototypes and simulations being demonstrated. Capabilities like DNA sampling and RFID tracking through insect-sized drones are currently speculative rather than reality.",
