    "full_text": "Claim On Pune's Steam Bar Treating or Preventing COVID-19 Is False\n\nA social media user claims that a steam bar with inhalers treats or prevents COVID-19 in Pune. The claim is accompanied by a video which shows people seated in front of pipes used as steam inhalers.\n\n\"Latest business in #India: The Steam bar, It is inhalers, which treats or prevents #COVID19 in Pune\" the tweet reads.\n\nFact Check/ Verification\n\nDifferent states in India continue to witness a rise in COVID-19 cases. Maharashtra, the epicentre of coronavirus in India has 2,75,404 active cases as of 8am on 25 September. It's followed by Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh which have 95,568, 69,353 and 61,300 active cases respectively.\n\nAt a time like this, the claim on Pune's steam bar with inhalers has been shared by many social media users in the past few days.\n\nSteam inhalation can thin mucus and help it drain from the nose when experiencing nasal congestion. \"Controlled studies show that these remedies do not kill viruses in the respiratory tract. Besides, there are no studies testing the effect of these remedies on preventing infection by the novel coronavirus,\" state the voluntary group of scientists, Indian Scientists' Response to CoViD-19, in their Hoaxbusters section.\n\nOn the other hand, a 2015 study published by the Spanish Pediatrics Association takes note of the burns or scalds that can be caused due to hot water or steam. \"Steam inhalation therapy (SIT), which has been used traditionally and is still employed today to treat mild respiratory tract infections despite the lack of evidence to support its effectiveness, can also cause burns indirectly through scalding.\"\n\nAlso steam inhalation as a treatment or preventive measure of COVID-19 is not listed by the World Health Organisation.\n\n\"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease,\" notes the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.\n\nOn 23 September, Chief of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Hospital, Dr FaheemYounus, responded to the initial claim saying, \"Let's not turn fear into business. This is completely useless.\"\n\nNote: We were unable to locate the exact steam bar from the claim.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe recent claim which states that a steam bar with inhalers treats or prevents COVID-19 in Pune is false. Currently, there is no known medicine or treatment that can cure COVID-19.\n\nResult: False",
