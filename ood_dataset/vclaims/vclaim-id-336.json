    "full_text": "Claim: A recent mailer paid for by the America First Legal Fund alleged that Joe Biden and left-wing officials are engaged in widespread racial discrimination against Whites and Asian-Americans.\n\nRating: FALSE. Affirmative action policies\u2014which consider whether an applicant to a job, college, or social program is of a race that has been historically disadvantaged in the U.S.\u2014seek to achieve socioeconomic equity, not to target white and Asian Americans.\n\nThese claims of \"reverse discrimination,\" or that affirmative action favors people of color, are not new and race-based admissions policies have sparked controversy and conflict for as long as they have existed.\n\nLegal affirmative action programs neither grant preferences upon the basis of race, nor do they create quotas. This has held true especially in college admissions. In the Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the Court held that colleges and universities could use race as \"one factor among many\" in their admissions process, and that colleges and universities could not use a quota system to fill their classes.\n\nAffirmative action is an effective tool in redressing the injustices perpetrated by the United States' historical discrimination against people of color and women. Affirmative action merely permits factors such as race, gender, and national origin to be considered in admissions processes.\n\nPrestigious schools began more heavily weighing \"legacy\" applications in the 1920s as a response to the spike in applications following World War I, a time when schools were trying to keep themselves from being flooded with immigrants and Jewish people. During the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, when schools had to begin admitting Black students, schools would intentionally amend policies to minimize the number of Black students admitted.\n\nStudies have shown that legacy, athlete, and donor preferences disproportionately benefit white applicants. For instance, at Harvard, a white person's chances of being admitted increased seven times if they had family who donated to the school, and 43% of white students were not admitted on merit.\n\nThe Asian American plaintiffs' complaints about Harvard's admissions, while legitimate, are being used as a tool by those who do not genuinely care about student concerns. An internal Harvard study showed that if the university only looked to academic factors, about 43% of the student population would be Asian. However, removing race as a factor would likely disproportionately benefit white students through legacy, donor, or athletic admissions.\n\nThe claim that considering race in job and college applications unfairly targets white and Asian Americans is FALSE. These policies aim to provide equal opportunities to groups historically excluded from higher education and professional opportunities.",

    "vclaim": "America First Legal Fund claimed Biden and left-wing officials are discriminating against Whites and Asian-Americans through affirmative action policies. Legal affirmative action programs do not establish racial quotas or grant preferences solely based on race, as confirmed by the Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. Legacy admissions policies, which predominantly benefit white applicants, were historically implemented to limit immigrant and Jewish student enrollment. While Harvard's admissions policies may impact Asian American acceptance rates, removing race considerations would likely benefit white students more through legacy, donor, and athletic admissions.",
