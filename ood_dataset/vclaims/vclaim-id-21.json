    "full_text": "Claim: A speech made by Sudha Murthy about PM Narendra Modi.\n\nFact: Murthy Trust, the family foundation of Sudha Murthy and Narayana Murthy, told Factly that Sudha Murthy did not make this speech and that it is being misattributed to her. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.\n\nThe text of a long speech allegedly made by Sudha Murthy about PM Narendra Modi is doing rounds on social media. To investigate this claim, we searched the internet to see if any major media outlets have reported on such a speech by Sudha Murthy about PM Modi. This search did not lead us to any credible information.\n\nWe then contacted Infosys Foundation and Rishi Basu, Corporate Communications Director at Infosys, for clarification. Saying that Mrs. Murthy has retired from Infosys Foundation, they forwarded our request to the Murthy Trust for clarification. In an email response, Shivani from \"Murthy Trust\" told us, \"This is misinformation. This speech has not been given by Mrs. Sudha Murthy and is being misattributed to her.\"\n\nIn the past, the same speech was attributed to Sudha Murthy's husband, Narayana Murthy. The Quint and Alt News debunked that and published articles which confirm the speech is false.\n\nTo sum up, Sudha Murthy has never made this purported speech on Prime Minister Modi.",
