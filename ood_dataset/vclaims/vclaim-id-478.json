Interestingly enough, it is among the most commonly used aromatic herbs in parts of Europe. It is loved more than parsley or coriander in some eastern European nations.

One of the issues with dill leaves is that they lose their aroma quite quickly, perhaps due to the volatility of various terpenes. Thus, one should use it as fresh as possible for maximum health benefit.\n\nSource of micronutrients:\nAromatic herbs are not consumed in a significant amount, and thus they cannot provide many macronutrients. However, regular use of dill leaves can provide many vital micronutrients. Dill leaves are rich in riboflavin, niacin, folate, and vitamin C. It is also a good source of calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, and potassium.\n\nReduces stress:\nIt is a less studied and less realised benefit of aromatic herbs. However, it is worth remembering that humans first started using aromatic plants like dill due to their aroma. Its aroma can relax nerves and lower anxiety, improve mood, and boost appetite. These are some of the well-known benefits of dill leaves.\n\nGood source of antioxidants:\nDill leaves are not just part of the traditional Indian diet, it is also one of the common Ayurvedic remedies.

These days due to dietary imbalances and mental stress, people are more likely to develop chronic non-infectious diseases. Thus, antioxidants can help prevent metabolic disorders, heart diseases, brain disorders, and even cancer.\n\nResearchers have isolated many antioxidants in dill leaves. They contain flavonoids, terpenes, phenolic acids, steroids, and coumarins. Its aroma has lots to do with alpha-phellandrene, limonene, dill ether, and myristicin.\n\nGood for heart health:\nHeart diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. South Asians are especially prone to the condition. Studies show that Indians are more sensitive to even a slight increase in bad cholesterol and thus more likely to have blocked arteries.\n\nDill leaves may benefit heart in multiple ways. It can help improve mood, reduce stress, and also appear to have a blood pressure-lowering action. Additionally, it is rich in flavonoids that are known to have direct cardioprotective action.\n\nClinical studies show that dill leaves may reduce total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. At the same time, dill leaves can increase HDL cholesterol, which is good cholesterol.\n\nHelps manage diabetes:\nDiabetes is not a result of just high carb or sugars consumption. It is caused by many reasons like lack of exercise, stress, poor micronutrients consumption, and more.\n\nStudies suggest that adding aromatic herbs like dill leaves could be one of the healthy ways of normalising blood sugar levels. Dill leaves help not only due to their influence on blood sugar levels but are also rich in antioxidants that can help reduce the risk of various diabetes-associated complications.\n\nHelp prevent cancers:\nMonoterpenes in the plant can be quite good for preventing cancers. Dill leaves may help reduce the risk of breast cancer, colon cancer, and even lung cancer.\n\nOther benefits:\nEssential oils in the plant can help fight infections and boost immunity. Dill leaves are also good for bone health and may help reduce menstrual cramps.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nOne of the ways to stay healthy is to consume more aromatic herbs. However, it is essential not to limit ourselves to the use of just a few herbs. The secret to longevity is using multiple herbs and consuming them more frequently. For maximum benefits, it is also essential to consume them fresh.",
