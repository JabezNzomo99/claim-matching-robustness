    "full_text": "The City of Dorval Denounces False News Circulating on the Internet\n\nPublished on 01-27-2015\n\nFor a number of weeks now, false news has been circulating on social networks, as well as via a string of emails, about the Mayor of Dorval having allegedly refused to follow up on a request from Muslim parents asking him to remove pork from the City's school cafeterias. The story also quotes speculative comments from the Mayor in regards to Muslims.\n\nThe City of Dorval wishes to denounce this false article and resents this identity usurpation. Internet users across the world have published this false news as it was true, and the Mayor would like to set the record straight by saying that, on no account, he, nor any the City's representatives, have made such comments.\n\nAlbeit difficult to track the origins of this hoax, our research has led us to believe that it started in the United States. A similar hoax about a Mayor in Belgium had traveled the Web in 2013.",
