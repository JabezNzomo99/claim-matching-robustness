How have we ruined the country? Are rapid progress in agriculture, industrial growth, touching new horizons in science and technology, making primary education compulsory for children and increasing medical facility signs of ruining the country,\" he said at an election meeting here.\n\nCongress, he said, has not been able to accept defeat in the elections and to regain power was saying things which \"disgrace the honour of the country.\"\n\n\"We also fought election but never have we tried to disgrace the nation,\" he said adding the BJP-led coalition of 17 parties in the Centre has brought about a sea-change in the country which has been recognised the world over.\n\nThe green revolution has made the country surplus in foodgrain and reversed its dependence on imports. \"Today we are exporting foodgrain to various countries\", he said.\n\nVajpayee said his government wants a second green revolution for this a Rs 50,000 crore policy is being formed to double the per capita income of farmers by 2011. Twenty two states have implemented the agriculture insurance scheme under which claims worth Rs 2,000 crore have been sanctioned. Farmers have taken credit to the tune of Rs 83,000 crore through the credit cards launched for them.\n\n\"We are setting up 48 export units in 14 states with an investment of Rs 1325 crore that will facilitate Rs 10,300 crore worth of additional exports,\" Vajpayee said.\n\nThe Congress, he said, has alleged deaths of farmers under NDA rule but some deaths took place in Congress-ruled states which were provided sufficient foodgrains by the Centre but did nothing to distribute them.\n\nVajpayee, addressing his first election meeting in Punjab, said his party BJP's alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) was not for power but to give an alternative to Congress. \"People who used to criticise coalitions are today running bare-foot seeking alliances.\"\n\n\"Congress lost election but did not accept defeat. It did not want to sit in Opposition and serve the nation. We were in Opposition for 40 years but never raised any wrong step. Congress could not tolerate that it will have to sit in Opposition. Congress without power is like a fish out of water,\" he said recalling that the country's oldest party pulled down two governments for its \"lust for power\".\n\nFrom self-sufficiency in foodgrains to providing quality infrastructure like roads which are essential to make rural economies progress, the country's landscape has undergone a drastic change. \"I am surprised when Congress to win elections talks of things which bring dishonour to the country. They are away from reality.\"",

    "vclaim": "Prime Minister Vajpayee accused Congress of disgracing the nation in their pursuit of power. Vajpayee claimed his government accomplished more in 5 years than Congress did in 50 years. The BJP-led coalition government implemented a Rs 50,000 crore policy aimed at doubling farmers' per capita income by 2011. Under Vajpayee's government, 48 export units were being set up in 14 states with an investment of Rs 1325 crore. Congress allegedly pulled down two governments due to their desire for power and refused to accept their electoral defeat. The green revolution under BJP's governance made India self-sufficient in foodgrains and transformed it into an exporting nation.",
