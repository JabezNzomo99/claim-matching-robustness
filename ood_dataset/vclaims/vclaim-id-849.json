    "full_text": "Fact Check: Youth from Bihar didn't hack into Google, nor was he offered Rs 3.66 cr job\n\nA post is going viral on social media with the claim that Rituraj Chaudhary, a young man from Bihar, recently hacked Google.\n\nClaim:\nRituraj Chaudhary from Bihar was offered a job at Google after hacking into their servers. Google called him to the USA offering a package of Rs 3.66 crores per annum.\n\nFact:\nChaudhary didn't hack Google, but he notified them about a bug in their systems. Google acknowledged his bug report and enlisted him as a bug-hunter.\n\nDetailed Investigation:\nStories of white hat hackers getting job offers from tech giants are often exciting, but this particular story is not true. Many on social media shared an image of Rituraj Chaudhary claiming he hacked Google in 51 seconds.\n\nThe viral post claimed that Google officials in the USA went crazy, Rituraj resumed Google's services, and mailed them about a flaw on their website. It further stated that Google held a 12-hour meeting and decided to hire him with a Rs 3.66 crore package, even helping him get a passport within two hours.\n\nHowever, upon investigation:\n\n1. According to a DNA report, Chaudhary simply informed Google about a flaw or bug in their website that could have been exploited by hackers.\n\n2. A Dainik Bhaskar report confirmed that Google acknowledged the flaw and sent Chaudhary an acknowledgement email. Google often rewards those who find website flaws.\n\n3. Chaudhary is currently in Phase-2 of the bug hunt and will be awarded when they reach Phase-0.\n\n4. When contacted, Chaudhary dismissed rumors about getting a Google job worth Rs 3.66 crores and flying to the USA.\n\n5. He also clarified that he is not a student at IIT-Manipur (which doesn't exist), but at the Indian Institute of Information Technology Manipur (IIIT-Manipur).\n\nConclusion:\nThe stories about Chaudhary joining Google and receiving a huge salary are not true. He simply reported a bug to Google as part of their bug-hunting program.",

AFWA has found this claim to be misleading as the youth named Rituraj Chaudhary didn't hack Google, but found a bug in their system. Google has acknowledged his work and enlisted him as a bug-hunter. Rituraj confirmed to AFWA that everything about getting a job and flying in the states is not true",
    "vclaim": "A viral social media post falsely claimed that Rituraj Chaudhary from Bihar hacked Google in 51 seconds and was offered a job worth Rs 3.66 crores per annum. The truth is that Chaudhary only reported a security bug to Google through their bug-hunting program and did not receive any job offer. Contrary to viral claims, Chaudhary is a student at IIIT-Manipur, not IIT-Manipur, and is currently in Phase-2 of Google's bug hunt program.",
