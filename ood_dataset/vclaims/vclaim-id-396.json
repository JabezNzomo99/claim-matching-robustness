The claim also states that Tata made this offer after the ICC body allegedly fined Khan Rs 55 lakhs for waving the Indian flag after Afghanistan's victory against Pakistan in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023.\n\nWhat's the truth?: Ratan Tata clarified on his official social media handles that he did not announce any such reward.\n- CWC's official website does not carry any statement about Khan being fined Rs 55 lakhs.\n\nHow did we find out the truth?:\n- We performed a relevant keyword search and did not find any reports about Tata's announcement.\n- We came across Tata's clarification on X (formerly Twitter) about the viral claim.\n- He refuted the viral claim about rewarding any players and stated that he has 'no connection to cricket'.\n\nAdditional Verification:\n- Several media outlets like Money Control and NDTV also reported about Tata's dismissal of the viral claim.\n- We did not find any reports about Khan waving the Indian flag after Afghanistan's victory over Pakistan.\n- In fact, he was seen waving Afghanistan's flag and dancing with former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan to celebrate the win.\n- We did not find any notice about the fine attributed to Khan on CWC's official website or any other credible news website.\n\nConclusion: Ratan Tata did not declare any reward to cricketer Rashid Khan for waving the Indian flag after Afghanistan's victory against Pakistan.",

    "vclaim": "A viral message falsely claimed that Ratan Tata announced a Rs 10 crore reward to Afghanistan cricketer Rashid Khan for waving the Indian flag during CWC 2023. The viral claim falsely stated that ICC fined Rashid Khan Rs 55 lakhs for waving the Indian flag after Afghanistan's victory against Pakistan. Ratan Tata officially denied making any such reward announcement and stated he has no connection to cricket. Rashid Khan was actually seen waving Afghanistan's flag, not India's flag, while celebrating the victory with Irfan Pathan.",
