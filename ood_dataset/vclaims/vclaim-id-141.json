Now, the correction has been made in the ration card.\n\nTwo days ago, a video from Bengal's Bankura went viral. In the video, a man was seen barking like a dog to effect a correction on his ration card.\n\nSrikanti Kumar Dutta came up with the novel protest as his repeated pleas to correct his name were ignored by the officials. Srikanti Kumar Dutta was misprinted as Srikanti Kumar Kutta. Kutta means dog in Hindi.\n\nDutta thanked the media for helping him get his name changed from Kutta to Dutta.\n\nAccording to Dutta, he had to apply for rectification for the third time as his name was misprinted on the previous two occasions.\n\n\"I applied for a correction of the name on the ration card thrice. On the third time, my name was written as Srikanti Kutta instead of Srikanti Dutta. I was mentally disturbed by this,\" Srikanti was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.\n\n\"Yesterday, I went to apply for correction again and on seeing the joint Block District Officer (BDO) there, I started acting like a dog in front of him. He didn't respond to my query and ran away. How many times will common people like us leave work and go to apply for corrections?\" Srikanti added.",
