    "full_text": "Did the Kamala Harris campaign produce an AI image of a fake rally crowd and then distribute that picture? No, that's not true: The image in question was first published on the internet by a self-described parody account not affiliated with her campaign. That parody account subsequently posted again to say that the picture was \"generated with AI.\" Lead Stories found no traces of this specific AI-generated picture on the official Harris campaign social media pages.\n\nThe story originated from a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, where it was published on August 10, 2024, under the caption: \"The Harris/Walz rally last night had an electricity that I've never seen before. The right hates this.\"\n\nThe post implied that the image, with its poorly-rendered faces and hands, authentically showed attendees at a rally held by the Harris campaign. The picture quickly went viral, and many wrote on social media that her campaign was \"CAUGHT USING FAKE AI RALLY PHOTOS\".\n\nThe claim spread in multiple languages, including Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, and Greek. Among those who shared the image were prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, former New York congressman George Santos, and various other accounts.\n\nAlthough not every AI-detection tool was able to identify the image as inauthentic, the picture contains multiple telling signs that reveal it did not capture a real-life scene:\n\n- One woman in the first row had an elvish triangular-at-the-top ear\n- A man in the third row wore partially invisible eyeglasses blending with his cap\n- All inscriptions on clothing items were gibberish\n- Many faces in the background were badly distorted, with some appearing to float in the air detached from human bodies\n\nThe image lacked any details tying the crowd specifically to a Harris campaign event. There were no Harris-Walz posters typically seen at such rallies, and the picture did not include anything identifying the date and place of the supposed event.\n\nA Google reverse image search did not produce any matches indicating that the Harris campaign ever posted the image. The picture was not found in the official campaign collection of photographs or on their social media accounts (X, Facebook, Instagram).\n\nSeveral hours after the AI-generated picture appeared online, the account that first uploaded it (@sarcasmcat24) wrote: \"That's a photo that I generated with AI\" and \"Zoom in a bit, you'll see that the faces aren't even well developed.\" The account noted that it runs a parody account and was glad people enjoyed the post.\n\nWhen Lead Stories contacted the Harris campaign about the post, they said they only comment on claims about things the campaign actually posts.",

    "vclaim": "A viral AI-generated image of a Harris/Walz rally crowd was falsely attributed to Kamala Harris's campaign when it was actually created and posted by a parody account. The image contained obvious AI artifacts like distorted faces, floating heads, and unrealistic features that proved it was not a real photograph. The fake rally image was widely shared by prominent figures including Alex Jones and George Santos, spreading in multiple languages across social media. The Harris campaign never posted or distributed this image on any of their official social media channels or campaign materials.",
