The University of Toronto Scholarship Program Enables International Students to Study in Canada Comfortably and Free,\" reads the message.\n\nThe questions on the application form seek personal information such as name, country of residence, and desired course of study.\n\nClicking on the \"Apply Now\" button opens up another page congratulating the respondent and informing them that their application for the scholarship has been received.\n\n\"To proceed to the next step. Answer the following three questions to acquire your immediately (sic)!\" reads the message.\n\nThe multiple-choice questionnaire seeks information about the applicant's employment and marital status, as well as their age.\n\nAfter answering the questions, a new page appears containing another set of instructions for the applicants.\n\nThe first instruction is for the user to click on the provided \"Invite Friends/Group\" button to share the information about the scholarships with 15 friends or five groups on WhatsApp.\n\nThis sequence mirrors many phishing scams that are modelled as promotional giveaways aimed at mining people's personal information.\n\nScammers also use tactics similar to these to carry out click fraud, a common scheme that lures users to bogus websites with the promise of a reward.\n\nAfter sending the invitation, the next step is to click the \"delivery\" button.\n\n\"If you do not complete this step correctly, The VISA FORM page will not load,\" reads a warning at the bottom of the page.\n\nWhile the site promises a 'scholarship Visa form', this appears to be inaccurate.

A legitimate domain is usually older than the impostor domain.\n\nPesaCheck has examined the website offering scholarships ahead of the 2022/2023 intake in the name of the University of Toronto, and found it to be a HOAX.",

    "vclaim": "A fake website claiming to offer University of Toronto scholarships for 2022/2023 is scamming users by impersonating the legitimate university website. The scam website asks users to share personal information and spread the link to others via WhatsApp as conditions for receiving the scholarship. The fraudulent website uses a different domain name (make-achange.online) than the legitimate University of Toronto website (utoronto.ca) and was only registered in January 2022. The scholarship offer falsely promises benefits including full tuition, medical allowance, instant visa approval, and accommodation. The website's visa form claims are fraudulent as legitimate Canadian immigration forms are only available through the official Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada website.",
