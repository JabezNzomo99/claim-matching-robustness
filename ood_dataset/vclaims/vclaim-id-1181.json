The scheme is intended to fight and reduce unemployment among Nigerian youths by creating at least 774,000 jobs through direct youth empowerment targeting 1,000 jobs per local government.\n\nInstead, the link directs one to a page containing the Coats of Arms of Kenya and Nigeria alongside a number of flags including those of South Africa, India, and Uganda.\n\nThe page also contains the message, 'Presidential Youth Empowerment Scheme (P-YES)', indicating the programme aims to create 774,000 opportunities through direct youth employment in a period of two years.\n\nThe dubious website requires applicants to fill out a provided application form with personal information such as their name, country, state/region/county, phone number, and email address.\n\nHowever, according to a post by P-YES national coordinator Nasir Adhama, the registration procedure requires applicants to send inquiries to applicants@reg.p-yes.gov.NG.\n\nOnce the applicant has filled out the form on the dubious website, a new page opens up requiring the user to fill out additional information about their marital status, education level, and date of birth and to confirm if they are students or business owners.\n\nOnce the users click the 'Apply Now' button, a new page opens up containing a congratulatory message and asking them to answer three questions to check if they are eligible. The questions require applicants to indicate their age, whether they have a bank account or mobile money, and a summary of how they intend to use the money.\n\nAfter the users follow the instructions, another page pops up informing them that their applications to the Presidential Youth Empowerment Funds have been approved. In order for the grants to be made available, each must share the information with 15 WhatsApp contacts.\n\nThis sequence is consistent with several phishing scams that are modelled as promotional giveaways aimed at mining people's personal information. Scammers also use tactics similar to these to carry out click fraud, a common scheme that lures users to bogus websites with the promise of a reward.\n\nFurther, the WHOIS information of the dubious website shows that it was registered on 23 March 2022 in Iceland.\n\nOn the other hand, the WHOIS information of the legitimate P-YES website shows that it was registered on 19 November 2018 in Abuja.\n\nPesaCheck has examined the website promising government grants dubbed 'National Youth Empowerment Fund (P-YES)', and finds it to be a HOAX.",

    "vclaim": "A fraudulent website is impersonating the legitimate Presidential Youth Empowerment Scheme (P-YES) by promising government grants between 150,000-550,000 to citizens aged 13-65 years. The scam website, registered in Iceland in March 2022, differs from the legitimate P-YES website registered in Abuja in November 2018, and uses phishing tactics to collect personal information. The fake website requires users to share the grant information with 15 WhatsApp contacts to receive the promised funds, which is a typical characteristic of phishing scams.",
