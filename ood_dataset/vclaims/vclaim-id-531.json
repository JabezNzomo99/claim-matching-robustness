In wake of the celestial phenomenon, a 'warning' message is making rounds on social media that urges users to turn off mobile phones, laptops and other electronic devices in the night between 12:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. and keep them away. \"Because Cosmic Rays will pass near the earth at that time which can harm us by the effects of radiation,\" the message claims. The posts also mentioned TV Singapore, NASA and BBC as the source of the news.\n\nAccording to US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), cosmic rays are particles originating from outer space that traverse the universe, released by sources such as the sun, supernovae, and even black holes. Despite their huge speeds, when these particles encounter Earth, they are typically weakened by our atmosphere, making them generally harmless to humans.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency's report says cosmic rays are exceptionally high-energy subatomic particles, primarily consisting of protons and atomic nuclei. Occasionally, cosmic radiation penetrates the Earth's atmosphere, but it is harmless. On average, individuals are exposed to approximately 3.5 millisieverts of radiation annually.\n\nNewschecker reached out to experts who dismissed the viral message:\n\nDr. Debiprosad Duari, former director of M.P Birla Planetarium, Kolkata, stated: \"A solar eclipse is a frequent cosmic occurrence, happening periodically and cosmic rays consistently reach Earth's surface, originating from various celestial sources beyond our solar system, irrespective of solar eclipses. It is wrong to say that cosmic ray radiation, when interacting with an electrical device, can cause harm to the human body.\"\n\nDr. Sujoy Pal, Assistant Professor of AstroPhysics Department, added: \"Cosmic rays are actually high energy electrons or protons that originated outside our solar system. They come towards the earth by following its magnetic field and it is an ongoing process. These cosmic rays end up in our atmosphere. They are not likely to reach the ground or the human body.\"\n\nThe posts mentioning NASA and BBC were checked, and no such warning was found. Media outlets like Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Snopes have also published reports debunking this message.\n\nConclusion: The viral message recommending people to turn off their phones for protection against cosmic rays is false.\n\nResult: False\n\nSources:\n- US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\n- International Atomic Energy Agency\n- Telephonic interviews with Dr. Debiprosad Duari and Dr. Sujoy Pal",

    "vclaim": "A viral message claims people should turn off their electronic devices between 12:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. to protect against harmful cosmic rays during a solar eclipse. The message falsely attributes the warning to TV Singapore, NASA, and BBC. Scientific experts confirm that cosmic rays are a constant phenomenon, generally harmless to humans due to Earth's atmosphere, and not affected by solar eclipses.",
