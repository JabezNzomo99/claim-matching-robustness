    "full_text": "A video is being shared on social media claiming it is the visuals of Muslim pony service providers assaulting Kedarnath Dham pilgrims with sticks in Uttarakhand. Sharing the video, the post claims that Muslims were dominating horse riding services and other businesses in Hindu religious places, and further assaulting Hindu pilgrims.\n\nClaim: Video of Muslim horse operators assaulting Kedarnath Dham pilgrims in Uttarakhand.\n\nFact: The horse operators who attacked a woman and her co-travellers at the Bheem Bali bridge area are not Muslims. The Rudraprayag Police through a tweet informed that all the five accused who assaulted pilgrims on the Kedarnath Dham footpath were arrested, and in another tweet informed the accused names as Ankit Singh, Santosh Kumar, Rohit Kumar and Gautam. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.\n\nWhen searching the internet for details of the video using relevant keywords, screengrabs were found in an article published by the 'Devbhoomi Dialogue' news site on 13 June 2023. This news site reported that Rudraprayag police filed a case and detained four horse operators who were involved in the assault on Kedarnath Dham pilgrims.\n\nReporting the details of the incident, several other news websites published articles. As per the reports, Tanuka Pondar, a resident of Delhi, saw a horse in a bad condition, near the Bheem Bali bridge, during her pad yatra to the Kedarnath Dham. She asked people around for help, but no one came forward to help her. At the same time, she saw a horse operator mercilessly beating an animal, and she told him not to harm the animal. As soon as she had an argument with the man, a few co-horse operators joined him, started abusing the pilgrim, and assaulted her and her co-passengers with sticks. The incident took place on 11 June 2023.\n\nThe Rudraprayag Police informed that all the five accused who assaulted pilgrims on the Kedarnath Dham footpath were arrested, and stated the names of the accused as Ankit Singh, Santosh Kumar, Rohit Kumar, and Gautam. A minor was also involved in the incident, but the name was not revealed. Rudraprayag SP Vishakha Ashok Bhadane released a video detailing the incident on 14 June 2023.\n\nTo sum it up, the video of horse operators assaulting Kedarnath Dham pilgrims is shared now with a communal narrative.",
