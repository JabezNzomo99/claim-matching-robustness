    "full_text": "Microsoft Windows reports major service outage globally: Users share this 'error message' screenshot\n\nMicrosoft Windows users are facing Blue Screen of Death errors across the world. Many users took to microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to report about the issue. Windows users are seeing blue screen errors on their screen with the laptop/PC getting stuck on restart loop.\n\nThe outage has disrupted operations of several airlines, banks, broadcasting and emergency services across the world.\n\nMicrosoft has acknowledged the issue on its service status page.\n\nUS-based security giant CrowdStrike too said in a post on Reddit that outage is result of 'faulty update' that has now been rolled back. \"We have widespread reports of BSODs on windows hosts, occurring on multiple sensor versions.\" \"[We have] identified a content deployment related to this issue and reverted those changes,\" it said in the post.\n\nSo it is not clear which, if any, of the outages are related to the CrowdStrike problem or issue at Microsoft.\n\nImpact in India:\nThe disruption in Microsoft's services have impacted industries worldwide including airlines, banks and others. Indian airlines including Spicejet, Akasa Airlines and Air India Express have been affected. The Microsoft Cloud outage has resulted in flight cancellation and delays.\n\nSpiceJet said: \"We're currently facing a technical issue in providing updates on flight disruptions. Our team is actively working to resolve this issue. We regret for any inconvenience caused and will update you once the issue is resolved. Thank you for your patience and co-operation.\"\n\nIndiGo updated: \"As our systems are impacted by an ongoing issue with Microsoft Azure, we are experiencing high volumes at contact centre. Please contact us only if your travel is within 24 hrs.\"\n\nIT Minister's Response:\nIT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has responded to the global outage. \"MEITY is in touch with Microsoft and its associates regarding the global outage. The reason for this outage has been identified and updates have been released to resolve the issue. CERT is issuing a technical advisory,\" wrote Vaishnaw. The IT minister clarified that the NIC network has not been impacted by the outage. \"NIC network is not affected,\" added Vaishnaw.\n\nMicrosoft's Status:\nMicrosoft 365 Admin page shows 'Service degradation', implying that users may not be able to use Microsoft 365 apps and services.\n\nPreliminary root cause: A configuration change in a portion of their Azure backend workloads, caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.\n\nMicrosoft's Current Status:\nThey remain committed to treating this event with the highest priority and urgency while continuing to address the lingering impact for the remaining Microsoft 365 apps that are in a degraded state.\n\nIn a post on X, Microsoft 365 Status wrote that the company is \"investigating an issue impacting users ability to access various Microsoft 365 apps and services\". They're working on rerouting the impacted traffic to alternate systems to alleviate impact.\n\nUser Reactions:\nUsers on X shared various experiences, with many reporting blue screen errors and system disruptions. Some reported the issue might be related to a CrowdStrike update.\n\nSpecific User Comments:\n- \"Windows Crashed...! It seems everyone around the globe facing this issue.\"\n- \"Windows down. P1 everywhere. There goes my weekend.\"\n- \"Did anyone else's #Windows11 laptop suddenly encounter a #BSOD and crash?\"\n\nCause of Blue Screen Errors:\nReportedly, the issue is occurring after installing a CrowdStrike update. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company offering a cloud-based platform for security.\n\nUsers reported: \"CrowdStrike falcon is causing windows blue screen of death - issue across aws and azure.\"\n\nThe global tech community continues to monitor the situation as Microsoft and CrowdStrike work to resolve the widespread service disruption.",
