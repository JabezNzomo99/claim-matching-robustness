    "full_text": "Fact Check: This post on biryani is too sour to consume\n\nA set of pictures of a man serving biryani on a plate and some medicines is going viral on social media with a communal twist. The post claims that a biryani joint in Tamil Nadu's Coimbatore has two vessels for Hindus and Muslims, and the one meant for Hindus is laced with medicines to make them impotent.\n\nTwitter users \"Venky\", \"Ankur soni\" and others posted the images with the caption, \"Muslim biriyani ready to eat fastfood joints & restaurants have two vessels for preparing biriyani, One for muslims and the other for Hindus the vessel for Hindu's is mixed with tablets to make Hindus childless. In Coimbatore named restaurant 'Masha Allah' by Rehman Bismilla.\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be false. The pictures used in the viral post are taken from various unrelated sources. Coimbatore police have also called the post fake.\n\nAFWA Probe:\nUsing reverse image search, we found that all three pictures used in the viral post are unrelated and taken from different sources.\n\nViral Image 1:\nThis picture of the biryani seller has been used several times on various YouTube videos related to the delicacy as a thumbnail image. This video was uploaded in June 2016 with the caption, \"Indian Muslim festival DUM BIRYANI Preparation for 30 People & STREET FOOD\".\n\nViral Image 2:\nThis image was used in many Tamil websites regarding the haul of a large number of medicines from Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 2019, suspected to be used by the ISIS.\n\nViral Image 3:\nThis image is a screen grab from a video tweeted in 2017. The user claims this to be a scene from a restaurant selling biryani in India.\n\nCoimbatore police have recently replied to a user calling this viral post fake and warned of action against people peddling it on social media.\n\nHence, AFWA concludes that the viral post is absolutely false.",
