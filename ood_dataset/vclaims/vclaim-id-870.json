    "full_text": "No, Tata Group Is Not Charging Only One Rupee for the New Parliament Building!\n\nA post is making rounds on social media with a claim that the Tata group has decided to build the new Parliament building in 17 months at the cost of just one rupee to the government.\n\nThe claim also states that the Tata group did this as a 'gift to the nation'.\n\nThis comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the new Parliament building on 30 March.\n\nIs this true?: These claims are false.\n\n- The Tata group did not charge only one rupee to the government; the revised estimated budget was over Rs 1,250 crore.\n- The government had announced that the new building's construction would be completed in 2022, but some of the portions of the project are still under construction.\n\nLet's take a look at the first myth about the project's budget:\n\nWe found several reports from September 2020 which stated that Tata Projects Limited had won the contract to construct a new Parliament building at the cost of Rs 861.9 crore.\n\nBudget revised in 2021: According to the Union government, Rs 301 crore was spent on the Central Vista redevelopment project and Rs 238 crore on the new Parliament building in 2021. The revised estimated cost for the new Parliament building was Rs 971 crore.\n\nRevised budget in 2022: The report mentioned that the new Parliament building's cost has shot up by 29 percent, making the estimated budget over Rs 1,250 crore.\n\nThe official statement on the government website states that the tendered cost of the new Parliament building is Rs 862 crore, and the expenditure incurred on the Parliament building and Central Vista Avenue till March 2021 was Rs 195 crore.\n\nLet's take a look at the second myth about the project's construction:\n\nA report stated that the construction began in January 2021, and the government had announced a deadline of November 2022. However, some portions of the new Parliament building are still under construction.\n\nThe Central Vista's official website states that Modi had laid the project's foundation stone in December 2020, and the construction began after a month. The construction is still ongoing, and it has surpassed the 17-month timeline claimed in the viral post.\n\nA Lok Sabha document from December 2021 stated that the estimated cost of the new Parliament building is Rs 971 crores which was estimated to be completed by October 2022.\n\nConclusion: The claim about the new Parliament building being built by the Tata group in one rupee and in just 17 months is false.",

    "vclaim": "A viral social media post falsely claims that Tata Group built the new Parliament building for just one rupee as a gift to the nation. The actual cost of the new Parliament building project is over Rs 1,250 crore, significantly revised up from the initial budget of Rs 861.9 crore. The construction of the new Parliament building has exceeded the claimed 17-month timeline and the original November 2022 deadline, with some portions still under construction.",
