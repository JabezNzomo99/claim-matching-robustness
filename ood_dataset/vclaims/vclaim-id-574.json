But in Narendra Modi's priority list \u2014 his billionaire friends with tempo travellers,\" Rahul posted on his public WhatsApp channel, which has 6.9 million followers.\n\nRahul's reference to \"tempo travellers\" targeted Modi's allegation during the Lok Sabha campaign that the Adani and Ambani business houses were funding the Congress. \"How many sacks of black money has he received? What deal has been struck? Is money reaching the Congress in tempos?\" Modi said at an 8 May BJP rally in Telangana.\n\nThe BJP did not respond to requests for a comment on the issue.\n\nDuring the 2019 swearing-in ceremony of Modi, then chief of army staff General Bipin Rawat was seated in the second row, while Ambani, who was also present on the occasion, sat in the front row.\n\nSince 2014, the swearing-in has been on the forecourt of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Before Modi, only Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Chandrashekhar took oath in the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan, with all others sworn in at the Rashtrapati Bhavan Durbar Hall.\n\nJairam Ramesh criticised the seating arrangement on X by posting a photo of General Pande and General Chauhan seated behind the Ambanis and Khan, seen receiving greetings from Kailash Kher.\n\nIn the front row were the BJP leaders and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, the only leader from the Opposition who attended the 9 June ceremony. On the third row, the chief ministers of the BJP-ruled states were seated.\n\n\"Her Excellency President And PM Sir!! This is not acceptable!!,\" Congress Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Tankha also posted on X.",
