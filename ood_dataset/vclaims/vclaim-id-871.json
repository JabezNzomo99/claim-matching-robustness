    "full_text": "Viral Police Advisory Against 'Perfume Scam' In Hyderabad Found To Be Fake\n\nClaim:\nWarning from Hyderabad DCP against a gang of criminals kidnapping women by drugging them under the pretext of selling perfume\n\nFact:\nNo such advisory issued by the police, viral message found to be a recurring hoax\n\nAn advisory, purportedly from \"KR Nagaraju, DCP (crime branch)\" and addressed to all \"Hyderabadis\", cautioning citizens against being persuaded by \"perfume salesmen\" who test their products in the parking lot of malls, is being widely shared. An elaborate scheme is afoot to kidnap or rob women by lacing perfume samples with drugs that cause one to pass out, the message claims. The note states that over seven girls have gone missing in similar incidents that happened across three malls in the city.\n\nNewschecker analysed the viral police advisory, which was not written in formal language typical of government advisories and had multiple grammatical errors, raising our doubts on its authenticity.\n\nTaking a cue, we ran a keyword search for \"Hyderabad city perfume scam police advisory\", which did not throw up any credible news reports on any such instances of crime happening in the city nor an advisory on it.\n\nWe came across a report by The NewsMinute from July 16, 2019, which revealed a similar message claiming that salespersons near shopping malls were handing out perfume samples laced with drugs. The previous viral message claimed \"over 78 girls are missing in Hyderabad alone and more than 540 ladies are missing past 10 days,\" indicating that the new message follows the same template but changes the figures.\n\nWe further looked up Hyderabad City Police's website and did not see an officer named KR Nagaraju belonging to the DCP rank. A search on the Telangana State Police Department's official website showed that Nagaraju is the Nizamabad CP.\n\nA keyword search for \"Nagaraju perfume scam advisory\" led to a Bangalore Mirror news report from July 3, 2019. We learned that the viral advisory had been in circulation in 2019, and Nagaraju, who was a DCP posted in Warangal, Andhra Pradesh, clarified that the message being circulated in his name was fake and that he had filed a complaint.\n\nConclusion:\nAlleged warning issued by Hyderabad DCP against a gang that kidnaps women by drugging them under the pretext of selling perfume was found to be fake.\n\nResult: False\n\nSources:\n- The NewsMinute report, July 16, 2019\n- Bangalore Mirror report, July 3, 2019\n- Telangana State Police Department website",

    "vclaim": "A viral police advisory warning about criminals using perfume samples laced with drugs to kidnap women in Hyderabad malls was falsely attributed to DCP KR Nagaraju. The viral message claimed that over seven girls went missing after being drugged by perfume salesmen in three Hyderabad malls. The same hoax had circulated previously in 2019 with different numbers, claiming 78 girls missing in Hyderabad and 540 ladies missing in 10 days. KR Nagaraju, who was actually posted as Nizamabad CP and formerly as Warangal DCP, had filed a complaint about the fake advisory being circulated in his name in 2019.",
