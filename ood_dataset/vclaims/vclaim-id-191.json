    "full_text": "Hot Pineapple Water Will Not Cure Cancer, Viral Claim Is False\n\nWhile the scientific community continues to research the cure for cancer, a viral social media post claims to have found a cure that has \"defeated cancer\"- hot pineapple water. According to the viral message circulating in WhatsApp groups, adding a few slices of chopped pineapple to hot water and drinking this mixture can help boost the body's ability to fight the disease. Newschecker has found the claim to be false.\n\nThe claim had earlier gone viral in 2021 on social media, with several users sharing the post as genuine.\n\nNewschecker received this claim on their WhatsApp tipline requesting it to be fact-checked.\n\nQuoting one Dr Gilbert A Kwok, a professor of ICBS general hospital, the viral message says that \"Warm pineapple releases anticancer substances, the latest advances in medicine for effective cancer treatment.\"\n\n\"The hot pineapple fruit has the effect of killing cysts and tumours. Proven to repair all types of cancer. Hot pineapple water can kill all germs and toxins from the body as a result of allergies. The type of medicine with pineapple extract only destroys violent cells, it does not affect healthy cells. In addition, amino acids and pineapple polyphenols in pineapple juice can regulate high blood pressure, effectively preventing the blockage of inner blood vessels, adjusting blood circulation and reducing blood clots,\" it further adds.\n\nFact Check/Verification:\n\nTo begin with, Newschecker looked up Dr Gilbert A Kwok, who is purportedly a professor of ICBS general hospital. Despite extensive search, they did not find any leads with the name. They further looked up the keywords \"Hot Pineapple water\" on Facebook and found several posts that shared the same information. But these posts quoted one Dr Gilbert A Kwakeye instead of Kwok, and identified him as a doctor with the ICBS hospital.\n\nFurther research on the name of the doctor and the hospital in Chana did not yield any results, forcing them to conclude that there was no such individual.\n\nFurther, Newschecker looked up the effects of Pineapple on cancer. They found a study by doctors in Taiwan which revealed that Bromelain, a group of enzymes found in the fruit and stem of the pineapple, inhibits the ability of \"colorectal cancer cells (colon cancer)\" to proliferate.\n\nHowever, a write-up on the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre says that there isn't enough evidence to claim that Bromelain can significantly affect cancer in humans.\n\nAnother report, quoting Professor Dr Aru Wisaksono Sudoyo, chairman of the Indonesian Cancer Foundation, reads: \"Like other fruits \u2014 including apples and avocados, among others \u2014 pineapples are healthy. They are fruits that can support general health and immunity. No more than that. While consuming pineapple and other healthy fruits and vegetables may help reduce the risk of cancer, it is important to note that they are not equivalent to medical treatments or therapies for the disease.\"\n\nNewschecker further reached out to Dr Jojo V Joseph, Sr Oncological Surgeon, Caritas Cancer Institute in Kerala, who confirmed that the claim was absolutely baseless.\n\n\"Pineapple as a fruit is a good addition to your diet, like apple or banana, but has no added advantage. It is not some magic cure for cancer as it is being pitched. It cannot be used as a cure for cancer. Eating it over a long time does not guarantee prevention of cancer either,\" Dr Jojo said.\n\nConclusion:\nNewschecker research revealed that the claim of hot pineapple water being used as a cure for cancer is misleading. While the enzyme in pineapple may inhibit cell growth and induce cell apoptosis (death) in different cancers in test-tube settings, it may not necessarily be used as a cure for cancer.\n\nResult: False",
