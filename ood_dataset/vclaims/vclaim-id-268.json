Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order on a petition filed by H. Nagabhushana Rao, a resident of Malleswaram, who is a recipient of honorary freedom fighters' pension from both the Central and State governments since 1974.\n\nKey details of the case:\n\n1. Mr. Rao's pension from the Central government, paid through Canara Bank, was stopped in November 2017 as he failed to submit his annual life certificate due to mental and physical limitations.\n\n2. He submitted the certificate in December 2018, but the bank did not restore his pension, forcing him to move court in 2020.\n\n3. Though his pension was restored, the arrears of \u20b93.71 lakh for 2017-2018 were not paid, leading to another court petition in 2021.\n\n4. In 2022, the court directed the bank and Ministry to consider payment of arrears, but the Ministry granted arrears of only one month instead of 13 months.\n\nThe court directed the Ministry to pay within two weeks the arrears of \u20b93.71 lakh with 6% interest per annum from December 2018. If not paid within two weeks, the interest will become 18% per annum.\n\nThe court emphasized that while bank officers are not obliged to visit pensioners in every case, they should perform their duty in genuine cases where pensioners face difficulties in submitting life certificates, especially for elderly individuals.",

    "title": "Fact: Observing that bank officers need to visit elderly pensioners, at least in certain genuine cases when they do not submit life certificate within the deadline, the High Court of Karnataka has imposed a cost of \u20b91 lakh on a public sector bank and the Central government for compelling a 102-year-old person to approach the court thrice for release of freedom fighters\u2019 pension and arrears.",
    "vclaim": "A 102-year-old freedom fighter pensioner had to approach the High Court of Karnataka three times due to issues with his pension payments from Canara Bank and the Central government. The High Court imposed a \u20b91 lakh cost on Canara Bank and the Central government for their handling of the pension case. The pensioner's payments were stopped in November 2017 due to failure to submit a life certificate, but even after submission in December 2018, the bank did not restore his pension. The court ordered the Ministry to pay \u20b93.71 lakh in arrears with 6% interest within two weeks, with interest increasing to 18% if payment is delayed. The court ruled that bank officers should visit elderly pensioners in genuine cases when they face difficulties submitting life certificates.",
