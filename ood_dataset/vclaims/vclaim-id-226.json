Safaricom has increased FULIZA limit to 25,000 for Every Kenyan! [][]\"\n\nFuliza is an overdraft service offered by Kenyan mobile network operator Safaricom. The service allows M-Pesa customers to complete transactions when they have insufficient funds in their mobile money accounts. One needs to transact normally on M-Pesa, and Fuliza covers the shortfall.\n\nThe Safaricom website indicates that the Fuliza limit is increased by continued use of the telco's and M-Pesa services, and repaying Fuliza credit on time.\n\nThere is no information on the alleged increase on the telco's official Twitter and Facebook pages.\n\nTo authenticate the claim, PesaCheck reached out to Safaricom's Communications Business Partner Dennis Kioko, who denounced it.\n\n\"This is false. Each customer has a personalised limit based on their usage of M-PESA,\" Kioko said in an email response.\n\nPesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming that Safaricom has increased the Fuliza limit to Ksh25,000 for every Kenyan, and finds it to be FALSE.",
