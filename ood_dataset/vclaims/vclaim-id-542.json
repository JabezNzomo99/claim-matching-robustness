    "full_text": "Does This Graphic Show SII Donating Rs 52 Crore to BJP via Electoral Bonds? No!\n\nA graphic is going viral on social media platforms with users claiming that Serum Institute of India (SII) donated around Rs 52 crore to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) via electoral bonds.\n\nWhat have users said?:\nAn X (formerly Twitter) premium user shared the graphic with a caption that said, \"BIG EXPOSE: SERUM INSTITUTE OF INDIA donated 52 Crore Rupees in a single day to the BJP as electoral bonds. Now you can understand why no other vaccine was allowed in India.\"\n\nAre these claims true?:\nNo, this viral graphic shows donations made via the Prudent Electoral Trust and not electoral bonds. Additionally, there were several other vaccines that were allowed in India during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow did we find that out?:\nWe noticed that the graphic carried text that said, \"Money which companies gave to Prudent Electoral Trust was disbursed to the BJP almost immediately.\" It was attributed to news agency Reuters.\n\nTaking this as a hint, we performed a keyword search and came across a report published on Reuters that was headlined, \"Obscure trust links India's top businesses with Modi's election war chest.\"\n\nKey points from the Reuters report:\n\u2022 The Prudent Electoral Trust raised about $272 million since 2013\n\u2022 About 75 percent of that amount was donated to the BJP\n\u2022 The trust does not disclose how donations are distributed\n\u2022 Several companies like ArcelorMittal, Bharti Airtel donated large sums\n\u2022 Donations from SII, DLF Ltd, and Essar Group moved to BJP soon after Prudent received them\n\nWhat are electoral trusts?:\n\u2022 Introduced in 2013 by the Congress-led government\n\u2022 Companies set them up to distribute contributions to political parties\n\u2022 Trusts must distribute 95 percent of total income to eligible political parties\n\u2022 They maintain lists of contributors and recipients\n\u2022 Data is available on the Election Commission of India website\n\nData on Election Commission of India website showed:\n\u2022 SII donated Rs 50 crore and 25 lakhs to Prudent Electoral Trust in August 2022\n\u2022 A cheque of the same amount was issued to BJP on 18 August 2022\n\nAbout vaccine claims:\nAccording to a Lok Sabha answer in 2021, several COVID-19 vaccines were approved for restricted emergency use in India, not just SII's vaccine.\n\nConclusion:\nA graphic is being shared with a misleading claim that it shows the amount donated by SII to the BJP via electoral bonds.",

    "title": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to us. Adar Poonawalla is the Chief Executive Officer of the Serum Institute of India (SII).\n\nWhile SII did not donate money to BJP via electoral bonds, the company had donated Rs 50 crore and 25 lakhs to the Prudent Electoral Trust in three instalments in August 2022.\n\nA cheque of the same amount was later issued to the BJP on 18 August 2022.\n\nYou can read our fact-check here:",
    "vclaim": "Social media users falsely claimed that a graphic shows Serum Institute of India (SII) donated Rs 52 crore to BJP through electoral bonds. The graphic actually shows donations made through Prudent Electoral Trust, not electoral bonds. SII donated Rs 50.25 crore to Prudent Electoral Trust in August 2022, which was then transferred to BJP. The claim that no other vaccine except SII's was allowed in India during COVID-19 is false, as multiple vaccines were approved for emergency use.",
