    "full_text": "How to Spot a Job Scam: A Case Study of the Mara Resort and Aero Cargo Job Hoaxes\n\nDesperate to make ends meet, many unsuspecting job seekers are becoming victims of scam traps. For the past one and a half years, job seekers in the hotel and cargo sectors in Kenya have fallen prey to scammers who purposely target these sectors by purporting to offer opportunities.\n\nThese con artists play on the fact that in Africa, the growth rate of available job opportunities pales compared to population growth. The scammers use various tricks such as creating job advertisements on websites, signing purported appointment letters, or inviting \"appointees\" to report for work.\n\nHere are 10 ways to identify job scams:\n\n1. Social Media Presence\nCheck the organization's Facebook page transparency. Look for pages that have changed names multiple times, which can be a red flag.\n\n2. Website Verification\nBe wary if the company website is:\n- Inaccessible\n- Always under maintenance\n- Has a URL that doesn't match the company name\n- Uses stolen images from other websites\n- Contains inconsistent information\n\n3. Payment Requests\nLegitimate employers do not ask you to pay fees. Be suspicious if you're asked to pay for:\n- Food handling certificates\n- Cargo handling certificates\n- Any other job-related fees\n\n4. Company Existence\nVerify the company's existence by:\n- Checking Google Maps and street view\n- Searching the Business Registration Service\n- Contacting local county government\n\n5. Phone Number Verification\nScammers often use the same phone numbers across multiple fake job listings. Check Truecaller and ensure the name matches the job advertisement.\n\n6. Interview Process\nBe cautious of job offers that:\n- Require no interviews\n- Guarantee employment\n- Promise immediate salary increases\n\n7. Appointment Letter\nCompare the appointment letter format with known scam templates. Look for:\n- Identical wording\n- Similar signatures\n- Consistent logo and design elements\n\n8. Social Media Reviews\nSearch social media for complaints or warnings about the job or company.\n\n9. Fact-Checking\nUse fact-checking websites like PesaCheck to verify job authenticity.\n\n10. Submit for Verification\nIf unsure, submit the job advertisement to fact-checking organizations for verification.\n\nKey Takeaway: If a job looks too good to be true, it probably is. Always research thoroughly and never pay for a job opportunity.",

    "vclaim": "Job seekers in Kenya's hotel and cargo sectors have been targeted by scammers who create fake job opportunities over the past 18 months. Scammers exploit Africa's high unemployment rate by creating fake job advertisements, issuing false appointment letters, and inviting people to report for non-existent jobs. Legitimate employers never require job seekers to pay fees for certificates or other job-related expenses. Job scams can be identified through various methods including checking social media presence, website verification, company existence verification, and phone number validation. Job offers that require no interviews, guarantee employment, or promise immediate salary increases should be treated with suspicion.",
