The HTML seems to be a generic page structure with placeholder elements for a YouTube video page, rather than a fact-check document. \n\nTo extract a fact-check article's content, I would need the actual HTML content of the fact-check report. Could you please provide the correct HTML document for processing?",

    "title": "We found that the viral video does not show Christian and Muslim priests participating in Hindu rituals as per a supposed order of the Kerala government. \n\nThe video shows the inclusion of Islamic practices in Theyyam performances as an example of religious harmony, as per media reports. The religious dance form also includes Muslim characters in an effort for communal harmony. Hence, the viral claim is false.",
