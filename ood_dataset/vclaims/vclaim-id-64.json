There may be heart patients or patients suffering from nervous disorder may be compelled to bear this serious impact of sound pollution which has had an adverse effect on them. Toddlers, kids are equally affected, said Kkumaar.\n\n\"It's akin to trespassing one's spatial control, one's house. If after right to privacy ruling (of the Supreme Court), even the state cannot enter one's house if he hasn't committed any crime, how the non-state religious actors can ruin one's peace tranquillity. After privacy being made a fundamental right, loudspeakers are no-go zone and needs to be banned,\" said the plea.\n\nA nine-judge Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court in August unanimously held that right to privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.\n\nCiting from the top court's landmark ruling, the petition said use of loudspeakers on religious structures was \"encroachment and violation of one's fundamental rights of privacy which is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty\".",

The petitioner argues that loudspeakers were never part of any major religions and only came into existence in 1924. The petition states that loudspeakers violate citizens' rights by disrupting sleep, reading, thinking, and affecting patients with heart conditions or nervous disorders. The petitioner connects the Supreme Court's ruling that privacy is a fundamental right to argue that religious loudspeakers violate this constitutional protection.",
