    "full_text": "Here's What Experts Have To Say About The Viral 'Google Pay Scam'\n\nEver since its launch in 2016, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), has played a major role in the growth of digital payments in the country. India has nearly 26 Crore unique UPI users currently and this increase in the volume of digital payments is paralleled with a rise in the cases of cybercrime in the country. 37.5% of UPI transactions in 2021 were through Google Pay and that the money came up to Rs 2.74 Lakh Crore.\n\nIn this backdrop, several social media users are warning their connections of a 'new scam' involving digital payment platforms, specifically Google Pay.\n\n\"Be alert, Now a new funda fraud has started, someone deliberately sends money to your account or Google Pay and calls you and tells you that this money has gone to your account by mistake, you should send it back to my number. If you send money back to them, your account gets hacked and your account is hacked. So don't return any money received online. They should be told to come and take them in person. Take note. This fraud has started now be careful thanks. (sic)\" the viral post reads.\n\nThe special mention of Google Pay in the post has drawn a lot of attention and left several users worried. Notably, Google Pay was the second most popular UPI in India during the financial year 2022.\n\nFact check/Verification\n\nTo check if there has been any comments from Google Pay platform in the recent days over the viral claim, Newschecker checked the social media handle and the official website.\n\nIn the support section by Google Pay, we found a write-up titled \"Avoid payment transfer scams\", under which we found reference to the said scam under a drop down option called \"Money received scam\".\n\n\"If money is sent to you by someone who isn't a close friend or family member, do not send the money back directly. Instead, contact us. If someone you know and trust accidentally sends you money, you can choose to send the money back directly,\" the page informed.\n\n\"Scammers may use stolen forms of payment to send money to unsuspecting people, and then request that an equal sum of money be sent back. If you receive money from a form of payment that was stolen by a scammer, that money could be removed from your account. Do not send the money back. If you send your own money back, the stolen funds you received can also be removed from your account. If that happens, you'll end up with less money in your account than you had before you received the scam payment,\" it further said.\n\nCyber security experts explained that the scam typically involves social engineering tactics. Experts recommend:\n\n1. Avoid sending money back and raise it with Google Pay using their contact section\n2. Never reveal OTPs to any sender who claims to have sent money by mistake\n3. Never download any apps through which a sender may request payment\n4. Never scan any QR codes shared by a sender\n5. Never transfer money to anyone through your bank account or reveal bank account details\n\nConclusion:\nThe claim that hackers can hack your account if you send back money that 'accidentally' came to your account via Google Pay lacks context. The viral post does not clearly specify that the victim's account is hacked only when an element of social engineering is involved.\n\nResult: Missing context",

    "vclaim": "Social media posts warn of a scam where someone sends money to your Google Pay account, claims it was sent by mistake, and requests a refund, potentially leading to account hacking. Google Pay officially acknowledges the \"money received scam\" and advises users not to send money back directly to unknown senders, as the initial payment might have been made using stolen payment methods. The viral claim about account hacking through Google Pay refunds lacks complete context as it doesn't specify that successful scams typically involve additional social engineering tactics.",
