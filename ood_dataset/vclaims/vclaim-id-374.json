    "title": "Israel-Hamas war Highlights: Biden says Hamas, Putin both want to annihilate neighbouring democracy, Egypt will be opening its Rafah Border crossing, allowing humanitarian aid to reach Gaza after Israel agreed to permit a limited supply, marking the first relaxation in the 10-day 'total siege.' This development comes after US President Joe Biden's visit to Tel Aviv on Wednesday to show solidarity with Israel. Biden is expected to address the nation today to brief the country on the Israel-Hamas war",
    "vclaim": "President Biden drew parallels between Hamas and Putin, stating both aim to destroy neighboring democracies. The Israel-Hamas war began on October 7th with Hamas' attack on Israel, resulting in over 4,000 casualties on both sides. Egypt agreed to open the Rafah Border crossing for humanitarian aid to Gaza, with Israel permitting limited supplies following Biden's visit. Gaza faces severe humanitarian crisis with one million displaced people, complete power blackout, and critical shortages of essential supplies. The European Commission claims that 93% of Hamas' equipment originates from Iran. Twenty-one journalists have been killed since the conflict began.",
