    "full_text": "PM Modi 'Biggest Contender' For Nobel Peace Prize? Here's The Truth Behind Viral Claim Attributed To Asle Toje\n\nClaim: Deputy leader of the Nobel Committee Asle Toje said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the biggest contender for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nFact: No publicly available audio/video shows Toje making such a statement. News reports clarified that the quote was falsely attributed to him.\n\nDetailed Fact Check:\n\nMainstream and social media in India were abuzz with the \"news\" that Deputy Leader of the Nobel Committee Asle Toje declared PM Modi as the \"biggest contender\" for the Nobel Peace Prize. Major news outlets, including Times of India, Economic Times, CNBC-TV18, and OpIndia, reported Toje's alleged statement. Social media platforms were filled with users congratulating PM Modi for this supposed \"achievement\".\n\nWho Is Asle Toje?\nAsle Toje is the deputy leader of the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee that will select the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. He holds this position until 2024 and was in India to address an event organized by the India Center Foundation (ICF) earlier this week.\n\nVerification Process:\n1. The researchers analyzed Toje's recent address at the India Center Foundation event and found no mention of PM Modi's prospects of winning the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n2. They reviewed various interviews given by Toje to Indian media. While Toje speaks positively about the Indian Prime Minister, nowhere does he declare Modi as the \"biggest contender\" for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nNews Outlets Call Out Fake News:\nSeveral news outlets, including News Laundry, Zee News, The Print, and BoomLive, reported that the claim was false. The ICF chairman, Vibhav K. Upadhyay, explicitly stated that Toje never made such a statement and suspected media sensationalism.\n\nNobel Prize Website Clarification:\nThe official Nobel Prize website states that \"Neither the names of nominators nor of nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize may be divulged until 50 years have elapsed.\" For 2023, there are 305 candidates - 212 individuals and 93 organizations.\n\nConclusion:\nThe viral claim that Asle Toje named PM Modi as the \"biggest contender\" for the Nobel Peace Prize is false. While Toje has spoken positively about PM Modi, there is no publicly available evidence of him making such a specific statement about the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nResult: False",
