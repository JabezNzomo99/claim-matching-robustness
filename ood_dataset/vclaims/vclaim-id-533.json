In wake of the celestial phenomenon, a 'warning' message is making rounds on social media that urges users to turn off mobile phones, laptops and other electronic devices in the night between 12:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. and keep them away. \"Because Cosmic Rays will pass near the earth at that time which can harm us by the effects of radiation,\" the message claims. The posts also mentioned TV Singapore, NASA and BBC as the source of the news.\n\nWhat are Cosmic Rays? Does it do any harm to the human body?\n\nAccording to US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), cosmic rays are particles originating from outer space that traverse the universe, released by sources such as the sun, supernovae, and even black holes. Despite their huge speeds, when these particles encounter Earth, they are typically weakened by our atmosphere, making them generally harmless to humans.\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency's report says cosmic rays are exceptionally high-energy subatomic particles, primarily consisting of protons and atomic nuclei, often accompanied by electromagnetic emissions. Occasionally, cosmic radiation penetrates the Earth's atmosphere, but it is harmless. On average, individuals are exposed to approximately 3.5 millisieverts of radiation annually.\n\nCan Cosmic rays affect us during an eclipse?\n\nDr. Debiprosad Duari, former director of M.P Birla Planetarium, Kolkata dismissed the viral message as fake. He added, \"A solar eclipse is a frequent cosmic occurrence, happening periodically and cosmic rays consistently reach Earth's surface, originating from various celestial sources beyond our solar system, irrespective of solar eclipses.\"\n\nDr Sujoy Pal, Assistant Professor of AstroPhysics Department, Sree Krishna College said, \"Cosmic rays are actually high energy electrons or protons that originated outside our solar system. It comes towards the earth by following its magnetic field and it is an ongoing process. These cosmic rays end up in our atmosphere. They are not likely to reach the ground or the human body.\"\n\nThe posts also mentioned NASA and BBC. Upon checking their websites, no such post was found. Furthermore, media outlets like Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Snopes have also published reports debunking this message.\n\nConclusion: The viral message recommending people to turn off their phones for protection against cosmic rays is false.\n\nResult: False\n\nSources:\n- US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\n- International Atomic Energy Agency\n- Telephonic interview of Dr. Debiprosad Duari, former director of M.P Birla Planetarium, Kolkata\n- Telephonic interview of Dr Sujoy Pal, Assistant Professor of AstroPhysics Department, Sree Krishna College",

    "vclaim": "A viral message claims people should turn off electronic devices between 12:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. to protect against harmful cosmic rays during the solar eclipse. The message falsely attributes its warning to TV Singapore, NASA, and BBC. According to NASA and experts, cosmic rays are naturally occurring particles from space that are generally harmless to humans due to Earth's atmosphere. Scientists confirm that cosmic rays are not affected by solar eclipses and pose no additional threat during these events.",
