    "full_text": "The only number that can be divided by all the numbers from 1 to 10\n\nAt times, mathematics can be tricky. It is known that in mathematics, no number can be divided by all the numbers from 1 to 10. However, this one number is very strange and has left all the mathematicians in the world perplexed.\n\nDiscovered by the great sage Srinivasa Ramanujan, let's observe the number 2520. Ramanujan outnumbered mathematics, contributed immensely to the number theory, infinity series, continued fractions, and much more. The number 2520 seems to be one of many numbers, but in reality, it is not.\n\nIt is a number that has surprised many mathematicians across the globe.\n\nThis number can be divided by any number from 1 to 10, both even and odd. The rest is zero.\n\nLet's have a look at the table:\n\n2520 \u00f7 1 = 2520\n2520 \u00f7 2 = 1260\n2520 \u00f7 3 = 840\n2520 \u00f7 4 = 630\n2520 \u00f7 5 = 504\n2520 \u00f7 6 = 420\n2520 \u00f7 7 = 360\n2520 \u00f7 8 = 315\n2520 \u00f7 9 = 280\n2520 \u00f7 10 = 252\n\nThe magic behind this one particular number can be explained by multiplication. Keeping in mind the Indian Hindu year, the riddle of this number is solved and explained below.\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, 30 days in a month and 12 months in a year, ie, 7 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 12 = 2520. This perfectly reflects the dominance of time.",

    "vclaim": "The number 2520 can be divided by all numbers from 1 to 10 with no remainder. The number 2520 was allegedly discovered by mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. The number 2520 can be obtained by multiplying 7 (days in a week) by 30 (days in a month) by 12 (months in a year).",
