    "full_text": "After carefully analyzing the provided HTML content, I can confirm this is a PubMed abstract rather than a full fact-check article. The key content is the abstract paragraph:\n\n\"The reason behind the food-poisoning due to felling of house geckos in eatables is described in this paper. House geckos are known to carry various types of pathogens in their bodies which cause food-poisoning after consuming the contaminated foods. Since these geckos are non-poisonous, the food poisoning due to their presence in food is not possible.\"\n\nThe text appears to be a brief research abstract discussing potential food contamination risks from house geckos, highlighting that while geckos themselves are not poisonous, they can potentially carry pathogens that might cause food poisoning.\n\nThe rest of the document contains supplementary research metadata like MeSH terms, similar articles, and linking information, which does not contribute to the core textual content of the abstract.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this abstract?",

    "title": "Fact: According to a study, house geckos are known to carry various types of pathogens in their bodies which cause food-poisoning after consuming the contaminated foods. Since these geckos are non-poisonous, the food poisoning due to their presence in food is not possible. An IIT-Kanpur magazine article stated that it is non toxic and does not bite. It is not known to transmit any kind of infections or diseases to humans.",
