    "full_text": "The viral WhatsApp forward on 'challenge vote' and 'tender vote' is a hoax\n\nCLAIM\nA message that is being shared widely on WhatsApp is making several fictitious claims about the voting process in our country. It is spreading misinformation about the concept of 'challenge vote' and 'tender vote'.\n\nHere's the message:\n\ud83d\udc49 When you reach poling booth and find that your name is not in voter list, just show your Aadhar card or voter ID and ask for \" challenge vote\" under section 49A and cast your vote.\n\ud83d\udc49 If you find that someone has already cast your vote, then ask for \"tender vote\" and cast your vote.\n\ud83d\udc49 If any polling booth records more than 14% tender votes, repolling will be conducted in such poling booth.\n\ud83d\udc49 Please share this very important message with maximum groups and friends as everyone should aware of their right to vote\n\nSeparating facts from fiction\n\nClaim 1: \"When you reach the polling booth and find that your name is not on the voter list, just show your Aadhar card or voter ID and ask for \"challenge vote\" under section 49A and cast your vote.\"\n\nThis is false. Any person whose name is not on electoral rolls simply can't vote.\n\nThe concept of 'challenge vote' is wrongly explained. Firstly, the correct phrase is 'challenged vote' and under this, the polling agents challenge the identity of a voter and the presiding officer holds an inquiry into the challenge. Therefore, it has got nothing to do with challenging using Aadhar card or voter ID.\n\nFurther, the message wrongly ascribes 'challenge vote' to be a concept that comes under section 49A.\n\nIn reality, Section 49A of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, talks about the design of electronic voting machines (EVMs), and has no mention of 'challenge vote'.\n\nWe also got in touch with the spokesperson of Election Commission of India (ECI) Ms Sheyphali Sharan who confirmed that this information is false and that a person having his name missing from the voter list can't vote.\n\nClaim 2: \"If you find that someone has already cast your vote, then ask for \"tender vote\" and cast your vote.\"\n\nThis claim is true. As per Sharan, under section 42 of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, a 'tendered vote' is:\n(1) If a person representing himself to be a particular elector applies for a ballot paper after another person has already voted as such elector, he shall, on satisfactorily answering such questions relating to his identity as the presiding officer may ask, be entitled, subject to the following provisions of this rule, to mark a ballot paper (hereinafter in these rules referred to as a \"tendered ballot paper\") in the same manner as any other elector.\n\n(2) Every such person shall, before being supplied with a tendered ballot paper, sign his name against the entry relating to him in a list in Form 15.\n\n(3) A tendered ballot paper shall be the same as the other ballot papers used at the polling except that\u2014 (a) such tendered ballot paper shall be serially the last in the bundle of ballot papers issued for use at the polling station; and (b) such tendered ballot paper and its counterfoil shall be endorsed on the back with the words \"tendered ballot paper\" by the presiding officer in his own hand and signed by him.\n\nClaim 3: \"If any polling booth records more than 14% tender votes, repolling will be conducted in such polling booth.\"\n\nThis is false.\n\nTechnically, as per judiciary, tendered votes are to be considered only when they are likely to affect the outcome of the election, that is, when the margin of victory is less than the number of tendered vote.\n\nFurther, there is no mention of a repoll in this regard in the Election Commission handbook. There's also no specific percentage that has been prescribed by the EC for it to happen, so the figure of 14% is a figment of imagination.\n\nVERDICT\nTimes Fact Check has found two of three claims made in a viral WhatsApp message about the voting process in India to be false.",

Therefore, it has got nothing to do with challenging using Aadhar card or voter ID. The claim under tender vote is true. As per judiciary, tendered votes are to be considered only when they are likely to affect the outcome of the election, that is, when the margin of victory is less than the number of tendered vote. So the third claim is false.",
    "vclaim": "A viral WhatsApp message falsely claims that voters whose names are not on the electoral rolls can cast a \"challenge vote\" under section 49A by showing Aadhar card or voter ID. The message correctly states that if someone finds their vote has already been cast by another person, they can request a \"tender vote\" under section 42 of the Conduct of Elections Rules. The message falsely claims that polling booths recording more than 14% tender votes will undergo repolling.",
