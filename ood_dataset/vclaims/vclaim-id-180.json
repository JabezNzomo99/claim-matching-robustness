We fact-checked and found this claim to be Mostly False.\n\nThe Claim\nA section of a Facebook video displays an ASMR video in which the narrator claims that a person can lose weight using leech therapy.\n\nFact Check\n\nWhat is leech therapy?\nLeech therapy, also known as hirudotherapy, is a type of medical treatment that involves the use of leeches to help alleviate certain medical conditions. The practice has been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine and is still used in some modern medical practices today.\n\nDuring leech therapy, live leeches are placed on the patient's skin, typically near the affected area. The leeches attach to the skin with their suction cup-like mouths and then begin to feed on the patient's blood. As they feed, the leeches secrete saliva that contains various therapeutic compounds, including anticoagulants, anti-inflammatory agents, and anesthetics.\n\nCan you lose weight through leech therapy?\nNo. Leech therapy is not a proven method for weight loss and is not recommended for this purpose. Even though there are several ailments, such as arthritis, abscesses, thrombosis, etc., for which this therapy is used as a medicinal aid, it is not for losing weight. There is a lack of scientific evidence to prove that leech therapy will make you lose weight. The leech feeds on a person's blood and not on fat.\n\nWhile it is true that leech therapy can cause some blood loss, this is not a safe or effective way to lose weight. In fact, any weight loss that may occur as a result of leech therapy would likely be temporary and would pose significant health risks.\n\nAlso, losing fat is a multidimensional approach. If a person wants to lose fat, one needs to find out the cause of weight gain: inflammation, leaky gut, hormone imbalance, toxins, low metabolism, intake of medicines like steroids, etc. Once the cause is identified, that should be targeted along with other changes.\n\nNutritionist Pratiksha Rao explains this by stating, \"Permanent and healthy weight loss can only be achieved with a combination of reduced calorie diet, regular physical activity along with disciplined lifestyle and behavioural changes. Other factors that could aid in weight loss are pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. In addition, any weight reduction regimen in combination with physical activity results in the absence of weight regain.\"\n\nWhile leech therapy is generally considered safe when performed by a trained medical professional, there are certain risks and potential side effects associated with the treatment, including infection, allergic reactions, and excessive bleeding.\n\nSocial media often shares confusing and incorrect ideas about how to lose weight. These claims on social media present conflicting information, making it difficult to discern what is true. This poses a problem because it can lead people to adopt unhealthy practices. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution and consult experts or doctors before accepting or trying weight loss advice from social media.",
