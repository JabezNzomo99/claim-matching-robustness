    "full_text": "Fact Check: False Claim Linking CJI, Wife With Mamata Banerjee's Personal Physician Goes Viral\n\nClaim: Kalpana Das, the wife of CJI DY Chandrachud, is the niece of Dr. S.P. Das, the personal physician of West Bengal's CM Mamata Banerjee.\n\nFact: The claim circulating on social media including the names of CJI Chandrachud and his wife Kalpana Das along with Mamata Banerjee and her personal physician is false.\n\nA bench led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud is currently hearing the case involving the rape and murder of a female doctor at R G Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. Meanwhile, a newscard featuring a photo of CJI DY Chandrachud and his wife is circulating on social media with the allegation that his wife, Kalpana Das, is the niece of Dr. S.P. Das, the personal physician of West Bengal's CM Mamata Banerjee. It further claims that TMC's all-India General Secretary Abhishek Banerjee, spent a vacation in Malaysia and Bangkok with CJI.\n\nA Facebook user wrote, \"Is this not correct Mr CJI Dr Dhananjay Y Chandrachud? CJI's 2nd wife Kalpana Das, married in 2008, is the niece of Dr. S.P. Das, favourite Shyamada of Mamata Banerjee\u2026.what a revelation\u2026..!! Is this the reason why all CBI/ED cases of Waste Bengal are dangling in SC?\" If this is true, even you would agree that every \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f will be justified in doubting your integrity.\"\n\nWest Bengal Police and the Supreme Court Registry have both strongly refuted these claims. West Bengal Police stated, \"It has come to our notice that extremely derogatory and baseless aspersions are being cast by some people in social media about the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India including the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India. Exploiting freedom of speech to indulge in wild falsehood, that too against the Hon'ble Apex Court, is illegal and punishable.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court Registry clarified that the tweet is \"ill-intended, factually incorrect and an attempt to malign the judiciary\" and has registered a complaint with Delhi Police.\n\nKalpana Das Is From Odisha, not West Bengal\n\nAfter the passing away of his first wife Rashmi in 2007 due to cancer, CJI Chandrachud married Kalpana Das for the second time in 2008. She is also in the legal profession and has worked for many firms including the British Council. In May 2023, while addressing a national conference in Cuttack, CJI said that he feels very proud as the son-in-law of Odisha as his wife Kalpana Das is from that state.\n\nConclusion: The claim circulating on social media, claiming that Kalpana Das, the wife of CJI DY Chandrachud is the niece of Mamata Banerjee's personal physician Dr SP Das, is false.\n\nResult: False",
