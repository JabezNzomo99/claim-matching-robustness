In 2023, Minneapolis changed its noise ordinance laws to allow the Muslim call to prayer to be broadcast by mosques in the city, but the city itself does not issue the broadcasts.\n\nMinnesota has been the epicenter of Muslim migration to the United States since the 1990s, particularly in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. As of 2020, an estimated 140,000 Muslims resided in Minnesota, and there were at least 76 mosques across the state.\n\nMosques typically broadcast a call to prayer\u2014known as the \"adhan\"\u2014five times per day: at dawn, noon, afternoon, evening, and nightfall. The earliest prayer begins when light first appears each morning, which can be as early as 3:30 a.m. during summers in Minneapolis. The latest prayer, which takes place once the night sky is visible, often occurs as late as 11 p.m. in Minneapolis during the summer solstice.\n\nMosques in Minneapolis have been allowed to broadcast the call to prayer without a specific permit since 2022, but city noise ordinances often prevented public broadcasts of the earliest and latest calls to prayer and limited the broadcasts to 70 decibels or less. In 2023, the Minneapolis City Council voted to amend its noise ordinance, allowing all five broadcasts to sound regardless of the time of day.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.

    "vclaim": "Minneapolis changed its noise ordinance to allow mosques to broadcast all five daily Islamic calls to prayer, but the city itself does not issue the broadcasts. The viral claim that Minneapolis became the first major U.S. city to broadcast Islamic calls to prayer citywide is misleading as it omits crucial context about who actually conducts the broadcasts. Minneapolis mosques have been allowed to broadcast calls to prayer without specific permits since 2022, but were previously restricted by noise ordinances regarding timing and volume.",
