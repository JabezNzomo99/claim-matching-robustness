    "full_text": "FAKE: This internal memo claiming that Kenya Airways is recruiting is a sham\n\nKenya Airways has dismissed the internal memo as fake.\n\nThis purported Kenya Airways (KQ) internal memo dated 29 July 2024 claiming that the airline is recruiting new staff is FAKE.\n\nAccording to the alleged internal memo, KQ is looking to fill five roles: airline food service, flight attendant, receptionist, booking clerk, and security officer.\n\nQualifications include a D+ in O levels, excellent computer skills, and the ability to work independently in a fast-paced environment. Candidates must be team players with strong people skills, problem-solving abilities, self-motivation, discipline, attention to detail, and the capacity to handle stress.\n\nThe salary ranges from KSh45,000 to KSh60,000, negotiable after three months of probation.\n\n\"Send your CVs to kenyaairways68@gmail.com before 7th August 2024. Applicants send your CVs quoting job title on the the email subject line. NOTE: Only shortlisted candidates will be contacted,\" the document adds.\n\nHowever, is the internal memo authentic? PesaCheck investigated.\n\nA keyword search on the airline's official Facebook page, X (formerly Twitter) account, and website yielded no results related to the alleged memo.\n\nPesaCheck came across two similar job adverts flagged as fake on KQ's verified Facebook page. One flagged job ad was dated 20 May 2024 while the other was dated 17 June 2024.\n\nAdditionally, PesaCheck contacted KQ through their official customer service X account.\n\n\"Unfortunately not, we encourage you to keep an eye on our Careers section on our website or our LinkedIn page for any open positions and to apply if you meet the qualifications and requirements,\" the airline responded.\n\nAfter visiting KQ's career portal, PesaCheck found that the airline had advertised seven positions in the past month, with application deadlines between 6 and 9 August 2024. None of the positions listed in the purported internal memo PesaCheck is investigating appear among these seven vacancies in the past month.\n\nPesaCheck has looked into a memo supposedly from Kenya Airways (KQ) dated 29 July 2024 claiming that the airline is recruiting new staff and found it to be FAKE.",
