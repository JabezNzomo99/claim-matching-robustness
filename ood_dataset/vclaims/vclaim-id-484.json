YAG laser capsulotomy is a procedure to help you see clearly after cataract surgery. You may need this because months or years after cataract surgery, your vision may get fuzzy again. This happens when a membrane in your eye, called the posterior capsule, becomes opacified.\n\nBandage contact lenses (BCL) or therapeutic contact lenses (TCL): BCL is a management technique for promoting corneal epithelialization. This is different from cosmetic lenses. These lenses are sometimes worn after injury, disease or surgery to protect the cornea, relieve pain and improve the ability of the corneal epithelium to heal.\n\nOCT scans: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging method that uses reflected light to create pictures of the back of your eye. It can be used to diagnose and manage diseases like diabetes-related retinopathy and glaucoma.\n\nPerimetry: Perimetry is the systematic measurement of visual field function (the total area where objects can be seen in the peripheral vision while the eye is focused on a central point). This is a very important test in diagnosis and management of glaucoma and neurological disorders.\n\nB-scan: B-scan ultrasonography (USG) is a simple, non-invasive tool for diagnosing lesions of the posterior segment of the eyeball. Common conditions such as cataract, vitreous degeneration, retinal detachment, ocular trauma, choroidal melanoma, and retinoblastoma can be accurately evaluated with this modality.\n\nRetinal laser therapy: Retinal laser therapy, also known as laser photocoagulation, is an outpatient procedure that treats macular edema and small breaks in the retina. These conditions affect the retina and threaten vision. The retina is a thin membrane in the back of the eye that senses light.\n\nFollowing are the Eye related Services provided at Clinic:\n\nThere are different factors behind the causes of eye diseases.
