    "full_text": "Why does diabetes occur?\n\nAs stated by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disorders, type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system of your body attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. According to the scientists, type 1 diabetes is caused due to genes and environmental factors, such as viruses that might trigger the disease.\n\nType 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. It can be caused due to several reasons including lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, insulin resistance and genes, and family history. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, which is caused due to hormonal changes during the period as well as genetic and lifestyle factors.\n\nPredisposing factors for type 1 diabetes include:\n- Family history\n- Environmental factors\n- Presence of damaging immune system cells (autoantibodies)\n- Geography (certain countries like Finland and Sweden have higher rates)\n\nThe development of diabetes leads to symptoms like weight loss, which can serve as an early warning sign.\n\nFor prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, predisposing factors include:\n- Being overweight\n- Minimal to no physical activity\n- Family history\n- PCOS\n- High blood pressure\n- Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels\n\nIt has been observed that people from Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Asian American communities are at higher risk, though the exact reason is not yet clear.\n\nLastly, if you developed gestational diabetes during pregnancy, you are at a higher risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.",

    "vclaim": "Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing pancreatic cells, triggered by genetic and environmental factors. Type 2 diabetes, the most common form, is caused by a combination of lifestyle factors like physical inactivity and obesity, along with genetic predisposition. Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy due to hormonal changes, genetic factors, and lifestyle factors. Certain populations, including Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Asian American communities, have a higher risk of developing diabetes. Having gestational diabetes during pregnancy increases the risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes later in life.",
