Except, it isn't.\n\nMessage:\nPay only Rs 1 per day (Rupee one only).\nLike never before, the Modi government has started a new scheme exclusively for the Indian Army Battle Casualties and Weapon Purchase. \nThe government has opened a bank account where people can donate funds directly to the Army Welfare Account which will be used for purchasing weapons for the Indian Army and providing facilities for war casualties.\n\nPeople had suggested to the government to open a bank account to collect funds exclusively for battle casualties and purchasing weapons for the army, the Modi government has accepted the suggestion and opened an account in Syndicate Bank, New Delhi for the same.\n\nThe above is only a part of the message, one that further goes on to give bank details where a person can deposit money for this scheme.\n\nThe most immediate psychological response to something like this would be thinking that it's a racket of some sort. However, the Indian Army on Tuesday took to Twitter to put out a clarification.\n\nAs is clear from the army's clarification, the text message is not a hoax, but it's also not entirely true.\n\nWhile the text says the money received will fund weapons for the Indian army and facilities for the war casualties, the army's clarifications explains that it will be used for financial assistance to widows of battle casualties, their next of kins and dependents.\n\nAnup Sinha, retired colonel and director of the fund's accounts section also put out a notice explaining the rationale and motive behind the scheme.\n\nSyndicate bank, too, issued an official statement on its involvement with the fund on its website.\n\nThe Army's National Defence Fund:\nThe Indian Army also has something called the National Defence Fund. Set up in 1962, the fund is used for the welfare of the members of the Armed Forces (including Para Military Forces) and their dependents, according to the website www.pmindia.gov.in/national-defence-fund.\n\nAccording to the website, the fund is \"entirely dependent on voluntary contributions from the public and does not get any budgetary support.\"",

    "title": "This scheme by PM Modi that surfaced in 2017 is true however, the funds collected through this would be used for financial assistance to widows of battle casualties, their next of kins, and dependents, not army weapons.",
    "vclaim": "A message circulating about an Army Welfare Fund scheme where people can donate Rs 1 per day to help army battle casualties and weapon purchase is partially true but misrepresents the fund's purpose. The Indian Army clarified that the fund is legitimate but is actually used for financial assistance to widows of battle casualties, their next of kin, and dependents, not for purchasing weapons. The Indian Army also maintains a separate National Defence Fund, established in 1962, which relies solely on public donations and supports the welfare of Armed Forces members and their dependents.",
