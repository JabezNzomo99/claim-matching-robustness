    "full_text": "CBI books ABG Shipyard, its directors in biggest bank fraud case of Rs 22,842 crore\n\nABG Shipyard Limited, one of India's largest private sector shipyard firms, has been booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for defrauding 28 banks to the tune of Rs 22,842 crore.\n\nAlong with the firm, which is into ship building and repair, its Directors Rishi Agarwal, Santhanam Muthuswamy and Ashwini Kumar have also been named as accused in the case.\n\nThis is one of the biggest bank fraud cases (bigger than Punjab National Bank scam involving Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi) which the CBI will be investigating.\n\nAccording to the FIR filed on complaint of State Bank of India (SBI), the forensic audit report revealed that from April 2012 to July 2017, the accused colluded with each other and committed illegal activities including diversion of funds, misappropriation, and criminal breach of trust and for purposes other than for the purpose for which the funds are released by the bank.\n\nThe group is promoted by Rishi Agarwal, who has been a major player in the Indian shipbuilding industry. ABG Shipyard Limited (ABGSL) has shipyards with capacity to build vessels up to 18,000 dead weight tonnage (DWT) at Surat Shipyard and 1,20,000 dead weight tonnage (DWT) at Dahej Shipyard.\n\nABGSL has constructed over 165 vessels (including 46 for export market) in the last 16 years including specialized vessels like newsprint carriers, self-discharging and loading bulk cement carriers, floating cranes, interceptor boats, dynamic positioning diving support vessels, pusher tugs and flotilla for leading companies in India and abroad.\n\nABGSL also had reportedly bagged contracts from Indian Navy to build ships in 2011, however, the contract was later terminated as the firm was financially struggling.\n\nThe FIR mentions that the global crisis impacted the shipping industry due to fall in commodity demand & prices and subsequent fall in cargo demand. The cancellation of contracts for few ships/vessels resulted in piling up of inventory. This caused paucity of working capital and significant increase in the operating cycle, aggravating liquidity problems. There was no demand for commercial vessels as the industry was going through a downturn even in 2015. Further, there were no fresh defense orders released in 2015. The company was finding it very difficult to achieve milestones as envisaged in CDR and was unable to service interest and instalments on due date.\n\nThe company has been referred to NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) of Ahmedabad bench which had allowed the official liquidator for ABG Shipyard to carry out a private sale of the assets.\n\nABG shipyard owes:\n- Rs 2,925 crore to SBI\n- Rs 7,089 crore to ICICI Bank\n- Rs 3,634 crore to IDBI Bank\n- Rs 1,614 crore to Bank of Baroda\n- Rs 1,244 crore to PNB\n- Rs 1,228 crore to Indian Overseas Bank\n\nThe CBI is also conducting searches at premises linked to the accused.",
