ECI Data Refutes Claim\n\nClaim:\nThe BJP won by a margin of less than 500 votes in 30 seats, and less than 1,000 votes in 100 constituencies in the 2024 Lok Sabha Polls.\n\nFact:\nOn carefully analysing the data available on the official website of the Election Commission of India, we found that the lowest margin by which a BJP candidate won the Lok Sabha Poll was 1,587 votes. BJP's Rabindra Narayan Behera from Odisha's Jajpur constituency, who received 5,34,239 votes, defeated BJD's Sarmistha Sethi (5,32,652) by a margin of 1,587.\n\nNo other BJP candidate won by a margin less than 1,587 in the recently concluded General Elections according to the data from the Election Commission.\n\nThe second lowest victory margin for the party was in Jaipur, where party leader Rao Rajendra Singh won against Congress' Anil Chopra by 1,615 votes. On the whole, only 7 BJP candidates secured a victory with a margin of less than 5,000 votes in the 2024 Lok Sabha Polls.\n\nFor additional context, Shiv Sena's Ravindra Dattaram Waikar won the Mumbai North West constituency with the lowest margin of just 48 votes. Waikar received 4,52,644 votes, while Shiv Sena UBT candidate Amol Gajanan Kirtikar secured 4,52,596.\n\nHence, the viral claim that BJP won 30 seats with a margin of less than 500 votes, and 100 constituencies with a margin of less than 1,000 votes is fabricated.\n\nResult: False\n\nSources: Official Website of Election Commission of India",
