    "full_text": "A post claiming that there is no record of a bomb blast in India from 2014 till now due to firm security and the rule of law by the Modi government is being shared on social media. Let's verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: There is no record of bomb blasts in India under Modi government\n\nFact: Even after Narendra Modi assumed the role of Prime Minister in 2014, the country has witnessed several bomb blasts, such as the Pulwama attack in 2019, the Ukhrul blast, and the Chhattisgarh Maoist attack in 2023 as well as bombings in various North East regions. The government has even acknowledged these incidents in their responses in the Lok Sabha. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThrough a relevant keyword search regarding the claim, news reports were discovered detailing recent explosions in Jammu and Kashmir. Further research led us to reports of the 18 September 2016, terrorist attack on an army base in the Uri, resulting in the deaths of 17 army personnel. Terrorists targeted a CRPF van in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, on 14 February 2019, resulting in the death of over 42 people.\n\nAs far as the northeast region is concerned, in 2019, a grenade attack by ULFA (United Liberation Front of Asom) in Guwahati, Assam, resulted in six people being injured. Recently, six people were injured in a powerful improvised explosive device (IED) blast in the Ukhrul district of Manipur.\n\nApart from this, the latest attack in April 2023 by Maoists in Chhattisgarh was the biggest strike by the Naxals on the security forces in the State in the last two years. The timeline of major Naxal attacks in Chhattisgarh can be seen here. Also, In January 2021, a bomb blast took place near the Israeli Embassy in Delhi.\n\nSubsequent research on data related to the claim led to the 'South Asia Terrorism Portal' which reveals that there were 629 major incidents in India from 2014 to 2023 and there has been evidence of incidences of explosions in India during the prime Ministership of Narendra Modi.\n\nThe National Bomb Data Centre (NBDC) under the National Security Guard (NSG) reported that there were 406 explosive incidents in the country in 2016. In these incidents, a total of 479 individuals lost their lives, as per the response provided by the Union Home Ministry in Parliament. Multiple other responses in the parliament also talk about terrorist attacks after 2014.\n\nThis data contradicts the claim that there has been no occurrence of a single bomb blast since Narendra Modi assumed the role of Prime Minister. Factly had previously debunked similar claims.\n\nTo sum up, the country witnessed several bomb blasts even after Narendra Modi took office as Prime Minister in 2014.",
