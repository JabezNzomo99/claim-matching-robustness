    "title": "The story narrated in the viral message is inaccurate on many counts. Air Marshal (retd) Pranab Kumar Barbora was never the Air chief. In 2008, when the airstrip was reactivated, Barbora was the commander of western air command, and not the \"Air Chief \". The airbase was not 'built' by Barbora, but reactivated. After the Air Force had already reactivated the airstrip, the government eventually 'developed' the airstrip to allow the landing of larger aircraft. Barbora has also confirmed that he informed the Indian government through proper channels. There is no evidence of P Chidambaram having written any apology to China.",
