The Jamun, the Drumstick, a few Ashok, Neem and Peepal have survived, but all beauty is both transient and fragile, and the law of entropy is powerful. The lovely flowers of myriad colors are all gone. I wonder what happened to the peacock family that came every day and ate from my moms hand. The Bulbul, the sparrows, the parrots, spotted flycatchers, Cuckoos, a huge troop of monkeys that once in a month would upset the order of the place\n\n*Once people leave, a home becomes a house*. Initially, I didn't feel like selling, and now I don't feel like going. Time has taken away ten of its fourteen occupants.\n\nI walk around our neighborhood and see similar fate of so many homes once full of life now replaced or lying still.\n\nWhy do we stretch and stress to build houses? In most cases, our kids won't need it or worse, fight over it. \n*What is this human folly of attempting permanent ownership in a leased life with an uncertain tenure given by a landlord whose terms are non-negotiable and there is no court of appeal*\n\nOne day, all we have built with love and EMIs will either be demolished, fought over, sold, or lie in ruins. \n\nEvery time I fill a form that asks for 'permanent address' I smile at human folly. \n\nThere is a Zen story that an old monk walked into a Kings palace demanding he wanted to spend the night in this Inn and the guards told him, \"What Inn, can't you see its a palace?\". The monk said \"I came here a few decades back. Someone was staying there. A few years later, someone else took the throne from him, then someone else. Any place where the occupant keeps changing is an Inn.\"\n\nGeorge Carlin says *\"house is just a place where you keep your stuff as you go out and get more stuff\".* \n\nAs houses get bigger, families get smaller. *When the house has occupants, we desire privacy, and when the nest empties, we crave for company.* \n\nBirds and Animals must be laughing at us humans who give up living in order to build their dream home and, in the end, depart the Inn they mistook as a permanent residence.\n\n*The real folly of human desire!*\n\nAdditional Context from Comments:\n- A comment by Pravin Nadgouda notes that this text was not actually written by Javed Akhtar, but by Aseem Dhru in a LinkedIn post from a couple of months prior.",

    "vclaim": "A social media post falsely attributed to Javed Akhtar was actually written by Aseem Dhru on LinkedIn. The text discusses how homes eventually become abandoned or sold when families disperse, using the author's personal experience of a 14-member household that lost 10 members over time. The post questions the human desire to build permanent homes, comparing houses to temporary inns through a Zen story and arguing that permanent ownership is futile given life's temporary nature. The text reflects on the irony of modern housing, where larger houses coincide with smaller families, and people desire privacy when houses are full but crave company when empty.",
