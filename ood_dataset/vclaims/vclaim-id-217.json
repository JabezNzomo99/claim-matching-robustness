    "full_text": "SCAM: This website claiming that there are jobs at Mara Resort is a hoax\n\nPesaCheck's research shows there is no such hotel at the Maasai Mara National Reserve.\n\nA website article advertising job vacancies at Mara Resort, located within the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Narok County, is a SCAM.\n\nThe job advert, shared on a Facebook page, claims they seek to recruit front desk staff, waiters/waitresses, room attendants, chef/ kitchen staff and cleaners. The net salaries for the available positions ranges from Ksh20,015 to Ksh38,455.\n\nTo qualify for the jobs, one must be a Kenyan citizen with at least a high school education (KCSE). The candidate's attitude must be good, with excellent written and verbal communication skills, friendly personality, integrity, customer service, time management skills, and attention to detail.\n\nAfter performing a reverse image search, PesaCheck discovered that:\n- The image used on the Mara Resort's job section page is from Welgevonden Private Game Reserve in South Africa\n- The accommodation section image is from Tongabezi & Sindabezi in Zambia\n- The contacts section photo is of wildebeest and zebras migrating at the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania\n\nMara Resort is not listed among the camps and lodges at the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Another red flag is that the job advert's Facebook page link originally read \"Jobs \u2014 Mara Villanzia\" but the URL was \"mararesorts.co.ke\".\n\nPaul Tobiko, the director of communications at Narok County government, confirmed that these resorts do not exist. He warned about rising job scams asking applicants to pay fees for health and food handling certificates.\n\nPesaCheck concludes that this is definitively a SCAM and warns job seekers to be vigilant.",
