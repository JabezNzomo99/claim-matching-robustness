    "full_text": "Odisha Train Mishap: Old & Unrelated Video Shared As Brutal Interrogation Of 'Station Master Sharif' By CBI\n\nClaim:\nMain accused in the Odisha train mishap, Station Master Sharif, who was hiding in a West Bengal Madrasa has been arrested. A video showing his \"interrogation\" by the investigating authorities.\n\nFact:\nThe video has been available online since at least October 2021, and has been falsely shared to promote the made-up narrative of an absconding station master.\n\nA disturbing video of a person brutally assaulting a naked man lying on the floor with his hands cuffed behind him, is being widely shared online, with multiple social media users linking it to the June 2 Odisha triple-train accident. Those sharing the video alleged that the \"main accused\" of the Balasore train mishap, Station Master Sharif, who was allegedly hiding in a West Bengal Madrasa, has been arrested by the CBI. Newschecker found that the footage predates the Odisha train accident, and has been used to further build on the false narrative of the absconding station master of Bahanaga Bazar Railway Station, Sharif.\n\nNote: The video contains disturbing visuals and has not been embedded in this article.\n\nFact Check/Verification:\nOn carefully analysing the viral footage, we noticed that the audio was in a foreign language. Additionally the man was being assaulted with what appears to be a wooden bat. Taking a clue, we looked up keywords and found posts on websites like KrudPlug.net, dated November 3, 2022. \n\nIt carried a slightly longer and clearer version of the viral video with the caption, \"Man stripped naked and handcuffed gets beaten with a wooden plank by Cartel.\" The location was identified as Mexico.\n\nFollowing this, we looked up the keyframes of the clearer version of the viral video on Google lens led us to a Reddit post, dated June 9, 2022. It carried the viral clip, with the caption, \"...Cartel spanks a thief.\"\n\nWe found another Reddit post, dated October 30, 2021, carrying the same video with the caption, \"Thief beaten with paddle for stealing from cartel...\"\n\nA few other websites also shared the video asserting it to be from Mexico. However, we were not independently able to verify the same.\n\nFurthermore, the false narrative around \"absconding Station Master Sharif\" has already been debunked by Newschecker. \n\nEarlier this week, the South Eastern Railway CPRO had again clarified that no staff of the Bahanaga Bazar Railway Station staff was absconding or missing, and that everyone was cooperating in the investigation into the Odisha triple-train accident.\n\nConclusion:\nWe could thus conclude that over an year old video has been shared to further carry forward the false narrative of \"absconding\" Station Master Sharif.\n\nResult: False\n\nSources:\n- Post By KrudPlug.net, Dated November 3, 2022\n- Reddit Post, Dated June 9, 2022\n- Reddit Post, Dated October 30, 2021",

The viral video is actually an old footage from at least October 2021, reportedly showing a cartel beating a thief in Mexico, and has no connection to the Odisha train accident. The narrative of an \"absconding Station Master Sharif\" from Bahanaga Bazar Railway Station is false, as confirmed by South Eastern Railway CPRO that all station staff are cooperating with the investigation.",
