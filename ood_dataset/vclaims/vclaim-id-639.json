    "full_text": "Paris Olympics 2024: Educational qualifications of Indian badminton player Lakshya Sen\n\nAt the young age of 22, Lakshya Sen has made a record by becoming the only male badminton player and third overall to ever qualify for the semifinals in the history of Olympics. He has defeated Taiwan's Chou-Tein Chen by 19-21 21-15 21-12. Before Lakshya, only Kidambi Srikanth (2016) and Parupalli Kashyap (2012) had managed to enter the quarter-finals at the Olympics but could not win a medal.\n\nEarly life and Education:\nLakshya was born on August 16, 2001 to a Bengali family in Uttarakhand's Almora. Badminton came naturally to Lakshya, given his grandfather Chandra Lal Sen was the one who introduced badminton in the little town and his father D K Sen was Lakshya's first coach.\n\nIn 2010, Lakshya convinced his father to let him tag along to a badminton tournament. There, his enthusiasm and talent caught the attention of a coach who recommended him to Prakash Padukone, the father of badminton in India. Impressed by Lakshya, Padukone took him under his wing.\n\nLakshya trained hard at the Prakash Padukone Academy and even surpassed his mentor's record by becoming the youngest Indian to reach the national men's singles final at age 15. Along with pursuing his badminton career, Lakshya completed his schooling from Beersheba Senior Secondary School, Haldwani, Uttarakhand.\n\nCareer and Path to Victory:\nIn 2016, Lakshya won a bronze medal at the Asian Junior Championship in Thailand. His breakthrough came in 2018 at the Youth Olympics, where he won a silver medal at age 17. He continued his success by winning a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games and a silver at the Asian Games the same year. His win at the 2021 World Championships earned him respect in the badminton world.\n\nParis Olympics Journey:\nFor Lakshya, this is probably his most memorable tournament. He defeated his own roommate and fellow countryman H S Prannoy in the Round 16, winning 12-21, 6-21. In another notable incident, his win against Guatemala's Kevin Cordon was removed from records due to Cordon's elbow injury.\n\nWith P V Sindhu's defeat, Lakshya is now India's sole hope for a badminton medal at the Paris Olympics.",

    "vclaim": "A viral claim states that Lakshya Sen has qualified for the semifinals at the 2024 Paris Olympics and is the only male Indian badminton player to do so. The article contains false information as the Paris Olympics 2024 haven't started yet, making it impossible for Lakshya Sen to have achieved these claimed results. The article mixes true biographical information about Lakshya Sen's career achievements with fabricated claims about Olympic performance.",
