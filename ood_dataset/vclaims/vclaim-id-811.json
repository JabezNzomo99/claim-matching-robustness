    "full_text": "How to Spot a Job Scam: A Case Study of the Mara Resort and Aero Cargo Job Hoaxes\n\nDesperate to make ends meet, many unsuspecting job seekers are becoming victims of scam traps. For the past one and a half years, job seekers in the hotel and cargo sectors in Kenya have fallen prey to scammers who purposely target these sectors by purporting to offer opportunities.\n\nThese con artists exploit the fact that in Africa, the growth rate of available job opportunities is far lower than population growth. Scammers use various tricks such as creating job advertisements on websites, signing purported appointment letters, or inviting \"appointees\" to report for work.\n\nPesaCheck has debunked 10 fake jobs, many using \"Mara\" as their location at the Maasai Mara National Reserve or \"Cargo\" to legitimize their companies.\n\nHere are 10 ways to spot a job scam:\n\n1. Social Media Presence\n- Check the Facebook page transparency\n- Look for multiple name changes, which can be a red flag\n\n2. Website Verification\n- Check if the organization's website is accessible\n- Verify if the URL matches the website name\n- Look for inconsistencies or stolen images\n\n3. Beware of Fees\n- Legitimate jobs do not ask you to pay for certificates\n- Verify official certificate costs through county government portals\n\n4. Company Existence\n- Use Google Maps to verify the company's location\n- Check the Business Registration Service (BRS) for company registration\n- Contact county government to confirm licensing\n\n5. Phone Number Verification\n- Check if phone numbers are consistent across platforms\n- Verify the name on Truecaller matches the job advert\n\n6. Lack of Interviews\n- Be suspicious of jobs that require no interviews\n- Be wary of promises of guaranteed employment and quick salary increases\n\n7. Appointment Letter\n- Check for similar templates across known scam job adverts\n- Look for repeated formats and design elements\n\n8. Social Media Reviews\n- Search for public comments and experiences\n- Look for complaints about scams or payment requests\n\n9. Fact-Checking\n- Google the job to see if it has been previously debunked\n- Consult fact-checking organizations\n\n10. Submit for Verification\n- Use fact-checking organizations' tiplines to verify job authenticity\n\nKey Takeaway: Scammers often leave small mistakes. Always thoroughly research job offers, confirm their existence, and never pay for a job. If an opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is.",

    "title": "Hi, thank you for contacting PesaCheck.\n\nThe job advert you shared has several characteristics of a job scam:\n1. Job applicants have been asked to pay Ksh2485 for a food handling certificate. The same can be obtained from the county government website at a fee of Ksh1000.\n2. The phone numbers provided in the appointment letter and the number used to text applicants are registered under \"Mara Resorts, \" another resort we debunked and found to be a hoax.\n3. The template, colours, and wording of the appointment letter resemble appointment letters of two other job scams we have debunked - Mara Ressoto Villa & Spa, and Mara Avillaz Resort and Spa.\n\nYou can read this long-form article about how to spot a job scam for more pointers but so far, this job advert looks like a scam.",
