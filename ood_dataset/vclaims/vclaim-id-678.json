    "full_text": "HOAX: UNICEF is not running this cash promotion in Uganda\n\nThe United Nations humanitarian and development agency dismissed the promotion as fake.\n\nThis Facebook post claiming that the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is running a cash promotion in Uganda is a HOAX.\n\nThe post, also shared online, includes a screenshot of a text message allegedly from the mobile money service MTN Mobile Money, indicating that the user had received UGX 14,350,000 from UNICEF Foundation.\n\nAll users shared the same message, expressing gratitude to the purported foundation for their support and confirming they had received the money. The post encourages anybody interested in the promotion to inbox for a link.\n\nHowever, the posts exhibit several red flags, casting doubt on the authenticity of the promotion. For instance, messages from various users seem to have been sent simultaneously on 18 January 2024, at 12:48.\n\nCoincidentally, all users received identical amounts of money, and their account balances also matched.\n\nThere is no mention of a 'UNICEF Foundation' cash promotion on UNICEF's social media channels, Facebook page, and X (formerly Twitter) account, where the organisation shares updates.\n\nPesaCheck has previously debunked a similar claim of cash promotion allegedly run by UNICEF in Kenya.\n\nWe contacted UNICEF Kenya's communication specialist Dan Oloo, who dismissed the promotion as a scam, noting that the UN humanitarian and development agency was not running anything of that kind in Uganda or in any other East African country.\n\n\"We are aware of these activities, we are not familiar with UNICEF Foundation and the terminologies used to describe this promotion. There is an official UNICEF website, social media channels (Facebook, X, Instagram) where information and communication is officially shared,\" Oloo explained, adding: \"If there are jobs, there is a specific website that you visit and you can have whatever career related information you may need.\"\n\nPesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming that the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is running a cash promotion in Uganda and finds it to be a HOAX.",
