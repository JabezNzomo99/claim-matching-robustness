This information allows them to burn stubble when conditions are most likely to obscure the smoke, making detection more difficult.\n\nThe scientist explained that the centre itself uses satellite data to monitor stubble burning, but the same data is accessible to anyone, including farmers. He further stated that the timing of crop burning often coincides with periods of cloud cover or stable atmospheric conditions that trap pollutants near the ground. This deliberate timing makes the task of accurately identifying and mapping the burning instances from satellite imagery more challenging.\n",
