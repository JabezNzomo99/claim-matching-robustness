    "full_text": "Viral Message Shows Incorrect Data on Madrasas in Kerala\n\nA viral message on social media claims to reveal the number of madrasas in Kerala and the teachers working in those madrasas, as well as the amount the state spends on them. When The Quint's WebQoof team verified the claims, they found that many of them have no basis and are false. The message attributes the information to KT Jaleel, Minister for Higher Education, Minority Welfare, Wakf and Hajj, but this has been denied by the minister's office.\n\nCLAIM:\nThe message claims the government is spending large sums of money on madrasas and that KT Jaleel disseminated this information in the Assembly. The claim spread on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND OUT:\n\nClaim 1: Total Population of Kerala\nThe viral message claims Kerala's population is 3,56,99,443. According to the 2011 Census, the total population was actually 3,34,06,061.\n\nClaim 2: Muslim Population in Kerala\nThe message claims the Muslim population is 88,73,472. This matches the 2011 Census figure.\n\nClaim 3: Number of Madrasas and Teachers\nThe viral message states there are 21,683 madrasas with 2,04,683 teachers. However, Kerala Madrassa Welfare Board CEO Hameed PM told us there are actually 27,814 madrasas, with 1,70,816 teachers.\n\nClaim 4: Number of Panchayats\nThe message says there are 941 panchayats, which matches the official Kerala government website.\n\nClaim 5: Average Number of Madrasas per Panchayat\nThe message calculated 23 madrasas per panchayat (21,683/941), but using the Madrassa Welfare Board's higher number, this calculation is incorrect.\n\nClaim 6: Salary of Madrasa Teachers\nThe message claims teachers earn Rs 25,000 monthly. However, the Directorate of Minority Welfare and KT Jaleel's office confirmed the government does not pay salaries to madrasa teachers.\n\nClaim 7: Monthly Salary Expenditure\nThe message calculated a total monthly salary expenditure of Rs 5,11,70,75,000, which is based on incorrect figures.\n\nClaim 8: Pension for Madrasa Teachers\nThe message claims a monthly pension of Rs 6,000. In reality, the maximum pension is Rs 1,000 per month, with only 411 retired teachers receiving pension, none above Rs 1,200.\n\nClaim 9: Total Expenditure\nThe viral message suggests the total annual expenditure on madrasa salaries and pensions is nearly seven thousand crore rupees, which is completely unfounded.\n\nThe viral message has made several false claims about the Kerala government, which were widely shared on social media.",
