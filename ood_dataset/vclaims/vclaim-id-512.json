    "full_text": "Jio Offering Free Recharge To Celebrate Mukesh Ambani's Birthday? No, Viral Link Is Fake\n\nClaim:\nMukesh Ambani-owned Jio is offering free recharge for one month to celebrate Ambani's birthday.\n\nFact:\nNewschecker started by inspecting the link provided in the Facebook post, which brought us to a website, stating \"Mukesh Ambani Birthday Offer: Free Unlimited Recharge for 28 Days\", and another link, \"Get Free Recharge\", that requires entering a phone number.\n\nThe URL, https://www.goodphoneoffer.com, raised doubts as Jio's official website address reads, https://www.jio.com.\n\nA keyword search for \"Jio free recharge Ambani birthday offer\" did not lead to any credible news reports about such a scheme. Checking Jio's official website also did not reveal any relevant results.\n\nNewschecker learned that the \"goodphoneoffer.com\" website was found to be \"very suspicious\" and marked \"Young. Unsafe. Warning\" by Scam Detector, a major fraud prevention resource.\n\n\"The biggest problem is the fact that the domain name is too new. It was registered just a few days ago. This makes it almost impossible for a super new website to open the business, promote its services, convince clients to acquire them, use them, and then take the time to submit the reviews online. All of this is just a few days,\" read the report that gave a high phishing score of 90/100 and a malware score of 63/100, which raises red flags.\n\nCybersecurity consultant Hitesh Dharamdasani stated regarding a similar viral Whatsapp message on this \"special Jio recharge offer\", \"This message is completely fake and a part of pushing forward a fake website that will help collect numbers of citizens. In this way, numbers are obtained by fraudsters and used for scams.\"\n\nResult: False",
