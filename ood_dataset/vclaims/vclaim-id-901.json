    "full_text": "Edited Video Used to Claim Three-Eyed Baby Born in Germany\n\nWe found that the video has been created by copying the movement of the left eye onto the movement of the third eye.\n\nA manipulated video of a three-eyed baby is being circulated with the claim that he was born in Germany. However, we found that the video is not authentic and has been created by copying the movement of the left eye onto the movement of the third eye on the forehead.\n\nCLAIM\nIn the video one can see that the baby has three eyes with the third eye placed on the centre of the forehead. The video is being massively shared on Facebook and Twitter with a similar narrative.\n\nThe Quint received a query on its WhatsApp helpline with the claim that as per Potuluri Veera Brahmendra Swamy, a baby was born with three eyes in a foreign country.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND IT\nWe analysed multiple frames of the viral video and found that the eye movement of the third eye is the same as that of the baby's left eye.\n\nWe searched for the video on YouTube using keywords: \"three eyes baby\" and found a video uploaded on 9 July. The description of the video mentioned about a condition known as diprosopus which is a rare congenital disorder whereby parts or all of the face are duplicated on the head.\n\nWe found that the description of the video was taken from a case study published in 2018 titled as: \"A \"three-eyed\" infant: A case of partial facial duplication (diprosopus monocephalus triophthalmos)\"\n\nDr SS Bhati, a gynaecologist, told The Quint that he has not heard or read of any such case as seen in the viral video. We also looked for news reports on the viral video and did not find any.\n\nEvidently, an edited video is being circulated to falsely claim that a baby was born with three eyes in Germany.",

    "vclaim": "A manipulated video showing a baby with three eyes is being falsely claimed to show a real birth in Germany. The third eye in the video was created by copying and pasting the movement of the baby's left eye onto the forehead. Some social media users are linking the video to a prophecy by Potuluri Veera Brahmendra Swamy about a three-eyed baby being born in a foreign country.",
