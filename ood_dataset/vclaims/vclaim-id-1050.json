    "full_text": "A post is being shared on social media claiming that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has announced a '3-month free mobile recharge' offer to all Indian citizens as part of promoting Congress for the 2024 General Elections. The post shared a URL link and asked users to click on the website to avail of the free recharge offer announced by Rahul Gandhi. A few social media posts allege that the Indian National Congress has announced 'Free Recharge Yojana' to attract voters for Congress in the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. Let's verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Rahul Gandhi announced a 3-month free mobile recharge offer to all Indian citizens ahead of the 2024 General Elections.\n\nFact: Rahul Gandhi did not announce any such free recharge offer to citizens ahead of the 2024 General Elections. The web link shared in the post is fake and not associated with the Indian National Congress. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.\n\nWhen we searched to check whether Rahul Gandhi had made any such announcement of free mobile recharge for citizens, we could not find any such announcement on the official social media handles and the official website of Rahul Gandhi. The Indian National Congress (INC) too did not make any announcements offering free mobile recharges to citizens. If Rahul Gandhi or the Congress Party had made any such announcement of free recharge to citizens, several news organisations would have published articles reporting that information but there were none.\n\nThe web link provided in the post is not affiliated with the Indian National Congress. The domain \"limitedoffer.xyz\" was registered in November 2023.\n\nEarlier, when similar malicious Links were circulated in the guise of offering free mobile recharge for Indian citizens, Factly published a fact-check article debunking those fake social media posts.\n\nTo sum it up, Rahul Gandhi did not announce any free mobile recharge offer to citizens ahead of the 2024 General Elections.",
