Yet there is not a single report on even one case\u2026. because it never happened.\n\nFact #4: Image-Based Malware Is Possible, But\u2026\nDigital steganography is a method by which secret messages and other data can be hidden in digital files, like a photo or a video, or even a music file.\n\nIt is also possible to embed malicious code within a Good Morning photo, but it won't be a full-fledged malware that can execute by itself.\n\nAt most, it can be used to hide the malware payload from antivirus scanners, which is pretty clever to be honest\u2026\n\nFact #5: Image-Based Malware Requires User Action\nIn January 2019, cybercriminals created an online advertisement with a script that appears innocuous and would pass any malware check.\n\nHowever, the image itself has an \"almost white\" rectangle that is recognised by the script, triggering it to redirect the user to the cybercriminals' website.\n\nOnce there, the victim is tricked into installing a Trojan disguised as an Adobe Flash Player update.\n\nSuch a clever way to bypass malware checks, but even so, this image-based malware requires user action.\n\nYou cannot get infected by the Trojan if you practice good \"Internet hygiene\" by not downloading or installing anything from unknown websites.\n\nFact #6: Malicious Code Executes Immediately\nIf you accidentally download and trigger malware, it will execute immediately. It won't wait, as the hoax message claims.\n\nDeleting Good Morning or Good Night photos or videos will free up storage space in your phone, but it won't prevent any malware from executing.\n\nThere is really no reason for malware to wait before it infects your devices. Waiting will only increase the risk of detection.\n\nWhether the malware serves to take over your device, steal your information or encrypt it for ransom, it pays to do it at the first opportunity.\n\nPlease help us FIGHT FAKE NEWS by sharing this fact check article out, and please SUPPORT our work!",

    "title": "Fact:  There are no official warnings regarding this apparent threat. The viral message was found to be a hoax.",
    "vclaim": "There is a viral claim that Chinese hackers are using Good Morning videos, pictures and messages to hack people's devices and steal their data. The alleged source of the warning, Shanghai China International News, is non-existent. While it's technically possible to embed malicious code in images (digital steganography), such image-based malware requires user action to be effective and cannot execute automatically. There have been no documented cases of fraud or hacking involving Good Morning or Good Night messages. Malware executes immediately upon activation and doesn't wait before infecting devices, contrary to what the hoax claims.",
