    "full_text": "A photo is being shared on social media claiming it is the latest constituency-wise survey report released by NDTV and India Today about the upcoming 2023 Telangana assembly elections. The post highlights the BRS Party's victory in the Andole and Kodangal constituencies mentioned in the screenshotted text. Let's verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Latest constituency-wise survey report released by the NDTV and India Today on the upcoming 2023 Telangana assembly Elections.\n\nFact: Neither NDTV nor India Today had released such a constituency-wise survey report for the upcoming Telangana assembly elections. The latest India Today- CVoter opinion poll projected Congress securing 54 seats and BRS securing 49 seats in the upcoming Telangana elections. NDTV did not publish any opinion poll on Telangana Elections as on date. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.\n\nWhen we searched to check whether NDTV or India Today published any such constituency-wise survey poll on the upcoming Telangana assembly elections, we could not find any such constituency-wise survey on the official website and YouTube channels of NDTV and India Today.\n\nIndia Today in their C-Voter opinion poll projected Congress securing 39 % and BRS securing 38% vote share in the upcoming Telangana assembly elections. India Today-CVoter opinion poll predicted that Congress might win 54 seats and BRS might win 49 seats in the Telangana elections. However, India Today did not publish any constituency-wise opinion poll on the upcoming Telangana elections.\n\nNDTV as of date has not published or telecast any opinion poll results related to the upcoming Telangana assembly elections. We could not find any latest opinion polls related to the Telangana elections on the official website of NDTV.\n\nA few social media users shared a clear and full version of the same photo shared in the post. At the bottom right corner of the photo, one can see a watermark with the logo \"Arun Concepts\". Arun Concepts is a social media campaign group working for different political leaders and parties in Narayanpet, Kodangal, Parigi, and other constituencies. Though we could not ascertain whether the image was created by them, from all the above, it can be concluded that the image shared in the post does not show an opinion poll survey released by NDTV or India Today.\n\nTo sum it up, neither NDTV nor India Today has released a constituency-wise survey report on upcoming Telangana assembly elections.",

The latest India Today-CVoter opinion poll actually projected Congress winning 54 seats and BRS winning 49 seats overall, without constituency-specific predictions. The viral image appears to be created by \"Arun Concepts,\" a social media campaign group, and not by any news organization.",
