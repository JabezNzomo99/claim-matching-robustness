Officials estimate nearly 7 lakh kanals more remains to be cleared. The leaders who have faced action include those belonging to the BJP.\n\nLast fortnight, revenue officials seized land that they said was shown in revenue records as belonging to senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta in village Ghaink in Jammu (23.9 kanals or nearly 3 acres); as well as land occupied by a relative of former CMs Farooq and Omar Abdullah in Srinagar (40 kanals or 5 acres).\n\nThe drive has provoked protests both in Jammu and Kashmir provinces. The administration's repeated public announcements that people who have built residential houses on \"small portions of state land\" would not be touched have not calmed fears. Worried about the impact, BJP leaders have called on Lt Governor Manoj Sinha to ensure \"the poor\" are not affected in the action.\n\nWhile the allotment of the land to Gupta had been cancelled in 2016 following a PIL, it was retrieved only now. A senior revenue officer said they found several cases of people re-encroaching land retrieved from them during earlier drives.\n\nOther senior BJP leaders who have faced action are Colonel (retired) Mahan Singh and Prem Sagar Aziz. Officials claim to have retrieved 9 kanals and 15 marlas of land in Kathua from Singh, who as District Development Council Chairman enjoys Minister of State status. In Basohli area, 4.10 kanals of land was reportedly seized from Aziz, a former minister.\n\nIn Jammu province, two other senior leaders have received notices \u2013 the BJP's Abdul Ghani Kohli and J&K Apni Party's Zulfikar Chowdhary. Both were Cabinet ministers in the 2014-18 PDP-BJP coalition government.\n\nIn Srinagar, 40 kanals of land was retrieved from Srinagar's famous Nedou's Hotel. The Nedou's hotel chain was started by Michael Adam Nedou, an Englishman who settled in Kashmir and married a tribal girl, Mirjan. National Conference founder and the late CM Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah \u2013 the patriarch of the Abdullah family \u2014 was married to Michael Nedou's granddaughter.\n\nRevenue officials in Kashmir have also seized land from various other political leaders, including:\n- 1 kanal of 'kahcharai (grazing)' land from former Congress president Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed\n- 2 kanal and 7 marla of 'shamlat (village common land)' from PDP leader Syed Farooq Andrabi\n- 15 kanal of shamlat land from the family of former CM Syed Mir Qasim\n- 2 kanals from the widow of a former Union Minister\n- 15 kanals of orchard land from ex-finance minister Haseeb Drabu\n- 12 kanals from a prominent Kashmiri Pandit\n- 1 kanal and 18 marla 'kahchari' land from the kin of a senior NC leader\n\nA senior revenue official said they are also looking into a house built by Farooq Abdullah allegedly on state/forest land.\n\nThe Chief Secretary Arun Kumar Mehta stated that state land is being retrieved from big vested interests to revert it back for public use, such as building hospitals, schools, and playgrounds.\n\nCriticizing the drive, the PDP said the \"BJP's lotus seems to have been replaced by a bulldozer\", suggesting the action might be aimed at altering the region's demographic composition.",

    "vclaim": "The Jammu and Kashmir administration has retrieved 15 lakh kanals (1.87 lakh acres) of state and grazing land through an anti-encroachment drive launched in January. The anti-encroachment drive has targeted land occupied by several senior political leaders across parties, including BJP leaders and relatives of former Chief Ministers. Notable retrievals include land from BJP leader Kavinder Gupta, relatives of the Abdullah family, and various properties connected to other political figures like Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed and Haseeb Drabu. The drive has sparked protests in both Jammu and Kashmir provinces, despite administration assurances that small residential properties would not be affected. The administration claims the retrieved land will be used for public purposes such as building hospitals, schools, and playgrounds. The PDP has criticized the drive, suggesting it might be aimed at altering the region's demographic composition.",
