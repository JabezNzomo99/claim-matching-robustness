    "full_text": "Nehru, mom loved each other, did not have time for physical affair: Edwina Mountbatten's daughter\n\nIn a book recently published in India, Pamela Hicks n\u00e9e Mountbatten says that her mother Edwina and Jawaharlal Nehru deeply loved and respected each other but they did not have a physical relationship.\n\nThe book, \"Daughter of Empire: Life as a Mountbatten\", was first published in 2012 in the United Kingdom and was recently brought to India as a paperback.\n\nAccording to a PTI report on the book, Pamela writes that her mother and Nehru shared a \"profound relationship\" that bloomed after Edwina arrived in India along with her husband and India's last viceroy, Lord Louis Mountbatten in 1947.\n\nPamela was 17-years-old then and says that she saw the first stages of what would go on to become a relationship based on \"equality of spirit and intellect\". \"She found in Panditji the companionship and equality of spirit and intellect that she craved,\" Pamela is quoted as saying by PTI.\n\nReading Nehru's inner thoughts and feelings for her mother in his letters made Pamela \"realise how deeply he and my mother loved and respected each other\".\n\nPamela says that she was intensely curious to know more about the extent of the relationship between Nehru and Edwina. She wanted to find out whether or not their affair had been sexual in nature, but after having read the letters, she was utterly convinced it hadn't been.\n\nThey neither had the time, nor the space to wallow in a physical relationship. \"Quite apart from the fact that neither my mother nor Panditji had time to indulge in a physical affair, they were rarely alone. They were always surrounded by staff, police and other people,\" Pamela writes.\n\nPamela goes on to say that she spoke to Freddie Burnaby Atkins, Lord Mountbatten's aide-de-camp, who told her that Nehru and Edwina would have found it impossible to carry on a physical affair due to the very public lives they led.\n\nAs the Mountbattens prepared to leave India, Edwina wanted to gift Nehru an emerald ring. However, Edwina knew that Nehru would not accept it and so instead she handed the jewel over to Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, telling her to pawn it off in case of financial difficulties.\n\nDuring the farewell party organized for the Mountbattens, Nehru addressed Edwina directly, saying: \"Wherever you have gone, you have brought solace, you have brought hope and encouragement. Is it surprising, therefore, that the people of India should love you and look up to you as one of themselves and should grieve that you are going?\"",
