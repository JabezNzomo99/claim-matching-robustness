    "full_text": "The mystery of India's 'missing 54' soldiers\n\nThey are called \"the missing 54\" - Indian soldiers forgotten in the fog of past wars with Pakistan, and who appear to have slipped through the cracks of the rival neighbours' troubled history.\n\nIndia and Pakistan have twice gone to war over territory in the disputed region of Kashmir - in 1947-48 and in 1965. Then, in 1971, Pakistan lost a 13-day war to India, resulting in its eastern half - separated from the rest of the country by more than 1,600km (990 miles) of India - emerging as the sovereign nation of Bangladesh.\n\nIndia believes the 54 soldiers went missing in action and are held in Pakistani prisons. But more than four decades after they disappeared, there's no clarity over their numbers and fate.\n\nLast July, the Narendra Modi-led BJP government told parliament there were 83 Indian soldiers, including the \"missing 54\", in Pakistan's custody. The rest are possibly soldiers who \"strayed across the border\" or were captured for alleged espionage. Pakistan has consistently denied holding any Indian prisoners of war.\n\nChander Suta Dogra, a senior Indian journalist, has researched the story of the missing 54 for several years. She has spoken to retired army officers, bureaucrats and relatives of the soldiers and also accessed letters, newspaper clippings, memoirs, diary entries, photographs and declassified records of India's foreign ministry. Missing in Action: The prisoners who never came back, her meticulously-researched new book, tries to answer the key question: what happened to these men?\n\nWere these men actually killed in action? Does India have evidence to prove they were being held in Pakistan? Were they singled out for indefinite detention in Pakistan to be used as future bargaining chips? Were some of them - as many officers in Pakistan believe - Indian intelligence agents caught for spying? Were they tortured brutally after being caught in Pakistan in contravention of the Geneva Convention - international law governing warfare - making it too difficult or embarrassing for the country to repatriate them? Were some of the missing soldiers killed soon after they were captured?\n\nAnd why did the Indian government bizarrely \"admit\" that 15 of the 54 had been \"confirmed killed\" in two affidavits, submitted to a local court in the early 1990s in response to a petition on missing soldiers? And if that is the case, why does the government today insist that all 54 are still missing?\n\n\"It is clear that the government knew some of the missing men were actually dead. Then why did they retain their names on the list? Quite clearly, there is deliberate obfuscation and the government owes it to not just to the relatives of the soldiers, but the people of India to come clean,\" says Ms Dogra.\n\nThe brother of one of the missing soldiers told me the government had failed in its job.\n\n\"In the euphoria over the war victories, we just forgot these soldiers,\" he said. \"I blame successive governments and the defence establishment for their complete apathy. We even wanted a third party to mediate and get to the truth about these soldiers, but India did not agree to it.\"\n\nThe investigation continues to detail multiple unsuccessful attempts to locate or repatriate these soldiers, including family visits to Pakistan, government negotiations, and conflicting reports about their potential survival. The core narrative emphasizes the unresolved mystery surrounding these 54 missing Indian soldiers and the ongoing pain of their families who seek closure.\n\nThe article concludes by highlighting the personal tragedy, using the story of HS Gill, an air force pilot who disappeared during the 1971 war, whose family has been devastated by his prolonged absence, symbolizing the human cost of this unresolved historical mystery.",

    "title": "Fact:  It's not that there have been no efforts to trace the prisoners and bring them home. The two governments have held talks to seek their release. Successive Indian prime ministers have sought to figure out a solution. War veterans on both sides have campaigned for repatriation. It's not even the case that there was no exchange of prisoners between the two sides: India repatriated some 93,000 captured Pakistani soldiers after the 1971 war, and Pakistan sent back more than 600 soldiers, read a BBC report.\nhttps://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/2017/Jan/21/the-mystery-of-missing-indian-warriors-of-1971-1561365.html",
    "vclaim": "India claims 54 of its soldiers who went missing during past wars with Pakistan are being held in Pakistani prisons, while Pakistan denies holding any Indian prisoners of war. The Indian government has provided contradictory information about the fate of these soldiers, first admitting in court affidavits that 15 of the 54 were killed, but later maintaining all 54 are still missing. Multiple theories exist about the fate of these soldiers, including possibilities that they were killed in action, detained as spies, kept as bargaining chips, or died in custody. Despite numerous attempts through family visits, government negotiations, and diplomatic efforts, the mystery of these 54 missing Indian soldiers remains unresolved after more than four decades.",
