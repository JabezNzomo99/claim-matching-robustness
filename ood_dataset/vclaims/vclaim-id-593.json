The basic idea is that old Negro spirituals were based on the black keys of the piano because slaves weren't permitted to touch the white keys. Amazing Grace was written by a former slaver, and the assertion is that he heard the tune from his slaves.\n\nThis sounds like total BS. First off, there's no piano out on the cotton plantation, and the slaves' quarters were very unlikely to have had one either. Second, a house slave might be trained to play piano for the enjoyment of the household, but in that case, it seems equally unlikely that the tutor would only teach the student the black keys. Lastly, the black keys, when played in sequence, form a pentatonic scale (not the only one but the easiest one), and this scale is common not only in certain African tribal forms, but in numerous European and Asian cultures.\n\nAnyone have any proof or disproof of this thesis?\n\nFirst Answer:\nAccording to various sources, a concept of playing only black keys did exist, but not as a forced restriction on slaves. For example, Irving Berlin was known to compose exclusively on black keys, calling them \"n****r keys\" - a term common in early 20th century music industry. This was more about musical style and intuition than racial restriction.\n\nSecond Answer:\n\"Amazing Grace\" isn't an old Negro spiritual. The words were written by a British sailor involved in the slave trade who later became a clergyman. He only wrote the words, which were set to various tunes, with the current melody not used until about half a century after composition. The tune was likely derived from old British melodies.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. The claim about slaves only playing black keys is unsubstantiated\n2. There's no historical evidence supporting this restriction\n3. Pianos were unlikely to be common in slave quarters\n4. The pentatonic scale using black keys is common in many musical traditions\n5. \"Amazing Grace\" has no direct connection to slave music",

    "vclaim": "There is a claim circulating that slaves were only allowed to play the black keys of pianos, which is unsubstantiated by historical evidence. The story that \"Amazing Grace\" originated from slave music and was influenced by black-key-only piano playing is false, as it was written by a British sailor and set to various British melodies. While the concept of playing only black keys existed historically, it was related to musical style rather than racial restrictions, as exemplified by Irving Berlin's composition method.",
