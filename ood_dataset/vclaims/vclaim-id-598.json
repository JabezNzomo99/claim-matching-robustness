The cabinet is not sitting now,\" Kakade said.\n\nThe bench, however, was not impressed with this and said every time some reason is given to not take a decision.\n\n\"You (government) are dealing with such a case\u2026someone has sacrificed his life for the country and you are doing this. We are not happy,\" the court said.\n\nThe bench noted that it had directed the highest authority of the state (chief minister) to consider the matter as a special case and take an appropriate decision.\n\n\"We had requested the chief minister to take a decision. He should have taken a decision. If he could not have taken a decision or if it was so grossly improper for him to take a decision, let us know, we will deal with it,\" Justice Kulkarni said.\n\n\"You cannot shirk (the responsibility) now. Now you are saying the cabinet has to see. The cabinet is not sitting. This is not done. We expected much better from the government,\" he said.\n\nThe court in its order noted that the government has orally said the benefit cannot be granted to Sood under the privilege policy.\n\n\"We are quite surprised with this stand. We had asked the highest authority of the state to take a decision. If the chief minister is unable to take a decision then let the state government file an affidavit saying so,\" the bench said.\n\nIt directed the government to file an affidavit by April 17 and said it would then deal with the issue accordingly.\n\nAakriti Sood, in her plea, had challenged the government's communication on August 26, 2020, denying benefits claiming that Sood was not born in Maharashtra or had resided in the state for 15 years.\n\nThe petitioner contended that the family had been residing in Maharashtra for the last 15 years as desired by her late husband, who always intended to live in Pune.",

    "vclaim": "The Maharashtra government denied benefits to the widow of Army Major Anuj Sood, who was martyred in Jammu and Kashmir, under its ex-servicemen policy because he was not a domicile of the state. The Bombay High Court expressed displeasure with the state government for not deciding on the matter despite the court's direction to the Chief Minister to consider it as a special case. The state government maintains that only those born in Maharashtra or who lived in the state continuously for 15 years are eligible for monetary benefits under their policy. Major Sood's widow, Aakriti Sood, challenged the government's denial of benefits, stating that the family had been residing in Maharashtra for 15 years as per her late husband's wishes.",
