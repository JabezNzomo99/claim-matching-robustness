    "full_text": "Parkinson's Disease: Overview, Symptoms, Causes, Risk Factors, Complications, and Prevention\n\nOverview:\nParkinson's disease is a progressive movement disorder of the nervous system. It affects nerve cells in the brain that control movement, causing symptoms that worsen over time. Initial symptoms are often mild and may include a barely noticeable tremor in one hand, foot, or jaw.\n\nSymptoms:\nParkinson's disease symptoms can vary but typically include:\n- Tremor: Rhythmic shaking, often starting in hands or fingers\n- Slowed movement (bradykinesia): Making simple tasks difficult\n- Rigid muscles: Stiff, tense muscles causing short, jerky movements\n- Poor posture and balance problems\n- Loss of automatic movements like blinking or arm swinging\n- Speech changes: Soft, slurred, or monotone speech\n- Writing changes: Cramped, small handwriting\n- Non-motor symptoms: Depression, anxiety, constipation, sleep problems\n\nCauses:\nThe exact cause is unknown, but key factors include:\n- Neurons in the brain slowly break down or die\n- Decreased dopamine production leads to irregular brain activity\n- Potential genetic changes\n- Environmental factors like toxin exposure\n\nRisk Factors:\n- Age (typically starts around 50-70)\n- Genetics (family history)\n- Male sex\n- Exposure to herbicides and pesticides\n\nComplications:\n- Cognitive difficulties\n- Emotional changes\n- Swallowing and eating problems\n- Sleep disorders\n- Bladder issues\n- Constipation\n- Blood pressure changes\n- Loss of smell\n- Fatigue\n- Pain\n- Sexual dysfunction\n\nPrevention:\nWhile no proven prevention exists, potential protective factors include:\n- Regular aerobic exercise\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages\n- Certain medications like ibuprofen and statins\n\nThe disease cannot be cured, but medicines and treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",

    "title": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves. Symptoms start slowly. \n\nThe first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also may cause stiffness or slowing of movement.",
    "vclaim": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder affecting movement through the deterioration of brain cells that produce dopamine. The main symptoms include tremors, slow movement, muscle rigidity, poor posture, and changes in speech and writing, along with non-motor symptoms like depression and sleep problems. While the exact cause is unknown, risk factors include age, genetics, being male, and exposure to certain environmental toxins like herbicides and pesticides. The disease leads to various complications including cognitive difficulties, emotional changes, physical problems like swallowing difficulties, and autonomic dysfunction. Though Parkinson's disease cannot be cured, regular exercise, caffeine consumption, and certain medications may help prevent or manage symptoms.",
