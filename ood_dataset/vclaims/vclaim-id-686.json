    "full_text": "Were NFL Referees Given Authority to Disqualify Players Kneeling During the National Anthem? No, that's not true:\n\nThe claim is from a satirical website whose articles Lead Stories has previously debunked. Lead Stories found no actual news articles mentioning such a change to the authority of NFL referees.\n\nThe claim appeared in a Facebook post on August 19, 2024, with a caption stating:\n\"NFL Referees were given the authority to disqualify players for anthem kneeling.\nSo far they've tossed five of them.\n'The league isn't tolerating it anymore.'\"\n\nLead Stories traced the source to dunning-kruger-times.com, a satirical site part of the \"America's Last Line Of Defense\" (ALLOD) network. The article claimed the supposed new rule \"went into effect the first week of the season\" - which was more than two weeks away at the time of writing.\n\nA Google News search using keywords from the claim found no evidence to support the story. Lead Stories noted they had reached out to the NFL for comment.\n\nThe ALLOD network is run by Christopher Blair, who creates satirical websites designed to provoke reactions from conservatives by publishing fictional stories with provocative headlines. Every site in the network includes a disclaimer stating that everything on the website is fiction.\n\nBoth Reuters and Snopes have also fact-checked and debunked this claim.",
