    "full_text": "This Video Doesn't Show Celine Dion in a Wheelchair at Her Son's Wedding\n\nThis video shows Kathy Poirier suffering from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and not the singer, Celine Dion.\n\nA video showing a woman in a wheelchair dancing at a wedding is going viral on social media with a claim that it shows Canadian singer Celine Dion being helped by her children to dance at her son's wedding.\n\nLast year, Dion revealed getting diagnosed with stiff person syndrome, a progressive neurological and autoimmune disease that can set off muscle spasms and causes extreme muscle tightness.\n\nIs that really Dion?: No, the video shows Kathy Poirier from Florida, USA at her son's wedding in 2022.\n- Poirier suffers from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).\n\nHow did we find out the truth?: We divided the video into multiple keyframes and performed a reverse image search on some of them which led us to several reports from 2022.\n- A report published by The Indian Express on 24 May 2022 carried screenshots from the viral video.\n- The article stated that the woman seen in the video is Kathy Poirier, who lost the ability to walk after she got diagnosed with ALS.\n- It added that she danced at her son's wedding at Ever After Farms Blueberry Wedding Barns in Florida, US.\n- We also found a similar video, from a different angle, uploaded on Instagram by the wedding planners 'Roots and Stems' on 11 April 2022.\n- The text on the video mentioned that Zak danced with his mom at his wedding, which surprised the guests.\n\nKathy Poirier's interview: We found another report by Fox News which included quotes from Poirier about her experience with ALS and her son's wedding.\n- It mentioned that her three sons supported her and helped her to dance at the wedding.\n- We found a video interview of Poirier uploaded on YouTube by Good Morning America, an American television program, on 27 July 2022.\n- In the interview, she says that she felt the symptoms in 2018 and was later diagnosed with ALS.\n- \"Once I got on the dance floor, I knew my boys had me,\" she adds.\n\nKathy Poirier's statement: The Quint reached out to Poirier who confirmed that the viral video shows her with her sons. \n\nReports about Dion's health: Dion shared a video on her official Instagram page on 8 December 2022.\n- In the video, she talks about being diagnosed with 'stiff person syndrome'.\n- There have been no recent reports about Dion being unable to walk and being shifted to a wheelchair, as the viral video claims.\n- The singer has three sons \u2013 Ren\u00e9-Charles (21) and 11-year-old twins Nelson and Eddy \u2013 but none of them are married yet.\n\nConclusion: A video showing a woman on wheelchair at her son's wedding is not singer Celine Dion.",
