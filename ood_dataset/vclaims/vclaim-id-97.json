    "full_text": "The Supreme Court appointed a four-member committee in January 2021 to look into the farm laws, talk to all stakeholders and submit a report. Since no further progress is made after the report was submitted in a sealed cover, one of the members of the committee made the report public last week. This story looks at the major issues in the committee's report.\n\nIndian economy is traditionally agriculture-based. More than 55% of the population still depend on agriculture for their livelihood, making it the largest employer in India. The Agriculture and allied sector grew at 3.6% during 2020-21, making it one of the sectors that registered a positive growth even during the pandemic. However, all is not well in the agriculture sector. The sector is reeling under severe stress, with issues all over the spectrum right from pre-production to post-production. The monthly average income per agriculture household at an 'All-India' level during 2018-19 is Rs.10,218.\n\nSuccessive governments have been making efforts to address these issues through targeted interventions in the form of input investment support, Price support mechanisms, crop insurances to protect against uncontrollable events, and so on. The gains from these are hard to ascertain & quantify but the reality is that the sector still faces complex challenges. Amidst all these, the Government of India in the year 2020, brought in three farm laws aimed at enhancing the farmers' income: The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The enactment of these three farm laws resulted in widespread agitations across the nation, the epicentre being the Delhi Border. These were challenged in Supreme Court, and it had appointed a 4-member committee to understand the grievances of the farmers about the farm laws, the stance of the government and make suitable recommendations.\n\nSince the report was submitted to the apex court in a sealed cover, and no further progress is made, one of the members of the committee made the report public last week. We look at major issues dealt the committee & their response, as per the report available in the public domain.\n\nAbout the committee:\nThe apex court appointed committee initially had 4 members. But later, one of the members (Bhupinder Singh Mann, National President, Bhartiya Kisan Union, and All India Kisan Coordination Committee) recused himself from the committee. The other members include:\n\n1. Dr. Pramod Kumar Joshi, Former Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)\n2. Dr. Ashok Gulati, Agricultural Economist and Former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices\n3. Anil Ghanwat, President, Shetkari Sanghatana\n\nThe archive of the views of the committee members on various agricultural-related issues is to provide an insight into their approach & ideas towards reforming Indian agriculture. Some serious questions were raised regarding the composition of the committee. There is no mention of any criteria that are followed in the selection of the members of the committee. It is also not known if the court considered the previous writings & views of the committee members on the farm laws. It was widely reported that three of the four members of the committee have strongly supported the farm laws.\n\nIt is also not clear why a member of the committee chose to release the report in the public domain when the court is still hearing the matter.\n\nReport findings:\nThe committee adopted a four-stage approach to arrive at the feedback on farm laws- holding direct interactions, feedback, or suggestions to a dedicated email id, a dedicated portal to receive comments on the questionnaire and using evidence-based analysis.\n\nThe report claims that the 'silent majority' supports the farm acts, and the act of repeal is a travesty of justice to them. However, looking at their survey sample and the feedback compositions, it is difficult to understand how the committee arrived at this conclusion.\n\nMinimum or 'Maximum' Support Price:\nMinimum Support Price (MSP) is one of the measures for achieving remunerative prices for the farmers. The main issue raised by the farmer unions is regarding the MSP. They feared its removal gradually, thereby weakening their bargaining power.\n\nFreedom to sell anywhere:\nOne of the primary arguments in support of the farm laws is that it provides the farmers with the freedom to sell their produce anywhere outside the APMCs. However, there is no assurance for the farmers that the price outside the APMCs would exceed MSP.\n\nIt is evident from the committee report that on a majority of the issues, the committee agreed with the reasoning provided by the government. The committee did not delve into the operationalization aspects of the farm bills, which is the primary apprehension of the farmer unions and organizations. It also did not provide enough information on the respondent pool and has not provided details of any contrarian views received by the committee. In the absence of these details, the report may not help bridge the trust deficit that was a major point of contention between the government and the farmers.",

    "title": "While the numbers are true, the committee sent out invitations to around 266 farmer organizations, including the protesting organizations.Out of these 266 organizations, only 73 organizations (27.4%) interacted with the committee. Out of these 73 organizations, 68 organizations supported the acts in entirety or with some modifications. The report mentions that around 3.83 crore farmers are represented through these 73 organizations but did not mention the total number of farmers represented by the 266 farmer organizations including the ones that did not interact with the committee.",
    "vclaim": "A Supreme Court-appointed committee submitted a report on farm laws in a sealed cover, which was recently made public by one of its members. The committee claims that a 'silent majority' supports the farm acts, though the survey methodology and feedback composition raise questions about this conclusion. Farmer unions feared the gradual removal of Minimum Support Price (MSP) would weaken their bargaining power. While the farm laws promised farmers freedom to sell outside APMCs, there was no guarantee that prices would exceed MSP. The committee largely agreed with the government's reasoning but failed to address operational concerns of farmer unions or provide details about contrarian views received. Questions were raised about the committee's composition as three of its four members had previously expressed strong support for the farm laws.",
