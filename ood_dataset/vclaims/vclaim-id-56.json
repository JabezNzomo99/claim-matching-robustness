Over the past few months, PesaCheck has identified a number of scams offering jobs, loans, grants and giveaways, all using the names of prominent individuals, businesses and organizations on social media.\n\nA Buzzfeed article on scammers using Facebook to find new and unsuspecting victims in Kenya found that millions of Kenyans may have been exposed to fraud on the platform, and that the most likely target was the collection of information such as identity card and phone numbers that users are asked to share online. These scams trick users into thinking that they are interacting with legitimate entities online, and by the time they discover the fraud, it is often too late.\n\nScammers craft these fake offers and use them to prey on unsuspecting individuals, and they do this to steal a person's identity, defraud them of money, to increase clicks for monetary gain, or to steal personal information.\n\nThese scams mix some truth in with false information, and use this to manipulate legitimate content to increase their visibility and reach, making some hoaxes difficult to spot.\n\nSo, how can you avoid being conned? Here are some things to look out for in order to avoid falling for fraudulent posts on social media and on messaging platforms:\n\n1. Poorly written posts\nMany scams are produced in a hurry, and they often contain spelling and grammatical mistakes asking you to take certain actions. While errors may result from scammers having a poor command of the language, most mistakes are intentional and strategic.\n\nThe organizations that these scammers impersonate often have social media teams whose job it is to carefully craft messages before they go online, so it is unlikely that these errors would pass internal scrutiny before being published.\n\nIt is possible that these errors are inserted to dissuade those likely to spot them and report the scam, therefore this could be a strategy to isolate those who are less keen and more gullible, and who are more likely to fall prey to the scam.\n\nOne such indicator is posts that are written in all capital letters and that have a lot of exclamation points.\n\n2. Posts that ask users to share content with friends to win\nSome posts claiming to offer gift cards or shopping vouchers from popular stores or retail chains circulating on social media contain a link to a page that asks users to share the post with their friends and contacts as one step towards winning whatever prize is on offer.\n\nClicking on the link often redirects to a site that requires users to give personal information in order to claim winnings. The information requested varies from the name and phone number, to asking for payments via mobile money in order for their information to be processed.\n\nDespite fulfilling the conditions required to get the giveaway, another step is sometimes required: the user is asked to share the message with their WhatsApp contacts, or on Facebook groups, widening the net of potential victims to be scammed.\n\nNeedless to say, no voucher is forthcoming even after the post has been shared with contacts. Instead, the last step may lead to a new link, which tries to obtain additional data from the user.\n\n3. Posts that ask for money to facilitate a process\nScams that directly ask for money are the easiest to spot. This is common in job scams, and loan scams, where applicants are asked to pay a fee, termed as a processing, application or registration fee, to be considered for the job or the loan.\n\nPayment is usually required through a mobile money transfer app such as M-Pesa, which is most commonly used in Kenya. However, the fee is sent to a personal number \u2014 often described as an official at the entity in question, such as the human resource manager \u2014 and not to the company's legitimate bank account or mobile money paybill.\n\nSome scams offering giveaways, such as free gas cylinders, ask for a booking or delivery fee. The fee is relatively small, usually about Ksh 250 to Ksh 400, but this can translate to a hefty sum for the scammers should they succeed in fooling a large number of people.\n\nGenuine job ads, grants, loans and giveaways from legitimate companies do not require a fee to be paid, and being asked to pay upfront is a clear sign that something is fishy.\n\n4. Posts that direct to an unrelated website\nSome scams use the name of a real company, going as far as setting up a social media page or website with the name of the company in question.\n\nOne common tactic is the use of Google forms, which are quick and easy to set up, and can be made to look official and legitimate. These are popular with job and loan scams, and rackets used to steal people's personal information.\n\nIn other instances, scammers make false offers to lure users to websites that earn advertising revenue for their owners. This could be a Facebook post advertising a flash sale at an appliance store. However, the link on the post does not direct to the official website of the store in question, but instead leads to a basic-looking website, usually running on a basic content management system.\n\n5. Promotions or competitions shared on recently created pages or websites\nSome hoaxes are shared through posts that advertise a promotion or competition, with details on how to enter and win prizes.\n\nBefore clicking on any links from the page, check to see when the page was set up and whether there are other posts on the page.\n\nA genuine page from a major brand will have multiple posts, a small fraction of which might be promotions, and these often do not contain major, expensive giveaways. Often one-off giveaway pages will have been set up within the past month.\n\nTake a look at the date of the oldest post. Fraudulent posts are often shared on accounts that have recently been set up, sometimes just days before or even on the same day the scam was published.\n\nScammers may use a brand name and logo to advertise a campaign that asks users to like and share the competition to enter. Always check on the company's legitimate website or social media accounts to verify whether the same competition or campaign has been posted there.\n\nThe golden rule is, if something about the content does not sound right, it probably is not. If you suspect something, reach out to the brand in question. They often have multiple recognized channels for engagement, and they also tend to be very responsive to customer queries. If in doubt, ask.",
