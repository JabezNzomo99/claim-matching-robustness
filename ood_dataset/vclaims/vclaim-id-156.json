The gold was being transported allegedly without valid documents and proper security.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu police then detained the truck and informed the Income Tax authorities as well. When the person accompanying the gold told the authorities that they were transporting the gold to TTD treasury, they consulted the TTD, which initially denied that the gold seized in Tiruvallur belonged to it, but later confirmed the same and produced a letter to that effect. It was only two days later that the Election Commission authorities ordered release of the seized gold.\n\nFollowing the episode, Andhra Pradesh chief secretary L V Subrahmanyam directed special chief secretary (revenue) Manmohan Singh to visit Tirumala to inquire into specific lapses, if any on the part of Punjab National Bank and the TTD. Singh flew down to Tirumala on Monday to conduct the inquiry. He will submit the report by Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, TTD executive officer Anil Kumar Singhal told reporters in Tirumala that the TTD had gold reserves of 9,259 kilograms and the entire quantity of the yellow metal was safe.\n\n\"As per the Gold Deposit Scheme introduced on April 1, 2000, the TTD deposited the gold in various nationalized banks, including 5,387 kgs in State Bank of India and 1,381 kg in PNB. We pay 1.5 per cent of the value to the banks towards handling charges, besides one per cent towards commission,\" he explained.\n\nHe said the gold deposits made in the PNB on April 18, 2016, were to mature on April 18, 2019. \"We have to take the approval of the board to deposit the same in another bank or continue in the same bank. So, we had written to the PNB authorities on March 27 about returning the gold deposits back to the TTD treasury before the expiry of the term,\" he said.\n\nSinghal pointed out that it was responsibility of the PNB authorities to transport the gold by making adequate security arrangements till the gold reached the TTD treasury. \"We are no way concerned with the transport or security arrangements, as we are paying handling charges to the bank. It was for the bank authorities to produce relevant documents when the EC authorities seized the truck,\" the official clarified, adding that the TTD had got back its gold from the bank.",
