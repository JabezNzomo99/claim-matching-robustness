    "full_text": "HOAX: This Translag Aero Cargo K job offer is a scam\n\nA Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) official told PesaCheck that no such company operates at the airport.\n\nA job offer purportedly by an airport cargo company, Translag Aero Cargo K, is a HOAX. The letter, dated 11 February 2022, informs a job seeker of an appointment with a reporting date of 7 March 2022. \n\nThe applicant must carry the appointment letter, copies of academic certificates, and their National Identity card. The Human Resource Manager identified as Nicholas Kibiwott's signature appears on the letter. The company has allocated the applicant a Cargo Unit Certificate number as per the requirement for all cargo employees.\n\nThe letter further instructs the applicant to text their name and ID number to Kibiwott via provided phone numbers should they require hostel accommodation. A list of rules and regulations governing employees whilst at the company's premises is contained in the letter.\n\nHowever, the letter has red flags that it could be a scam:\n\n1. The letter does not indicate the applicant's position.\n2. The appointment letter states the company no longer conducts interviews and instead will put the new employee on probation for three months.\n3. While the reporting date is 7 March 2022, the letter warns that should the company not hear from the applicant by 2 March 2022, it will withdraw the offer.\n\nPesaCheck showed the appointment letter to Kenya Airports Authority (KAA). Kibibi Kajembe, a KAA customer service official based at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), dismissed the letter as fake, saying that the company does not operate at the airport.\n\n\"We kindly confirm to you that this is a fake company and does not operate at JKIA. Please, we advise you not to engage yourself in any business with the said company,\" she said.\n\nPesaCheck has examined the job offer from an airport cargo company named Translag Aero Cargo K and finds it to be a HOAX.",
