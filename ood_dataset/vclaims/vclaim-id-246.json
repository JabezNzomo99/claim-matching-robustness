    "full_text": "'Prohibition order not tenable': SC stays West Bengal government's ban on 'The Kerala Story'\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday stayed the West Bengal government's May 8 order banning the screening of the movie, \"The Kerala Story\". The theatres in the TMC-ruled state will now be free to carry out the public exhibition of the controversial film.\n\nA bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said it is the duty of the state government to maintain law and order as the film has been granted certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).\n\n\"Bad films bomb at the box office,\" the bench said.\n\n\"The legal provision cannot be used to put a premium on public intolerance. Otherwise, all films will find themselves in this spot,\" the bench, also comprising justices P S Narasimha and J B Pardiwala, said during the hearing which is still ongoing.\n\nThe bench further observed that the prohibition order by the West Bengal government is not tenable.\n\nIt said that in Tamil Nadu, additional security can be provided for every cinema hall screening the movie and requisite arrangements can be made for moviegoers who want to see the film.\n\n\"No steps shall be taken by Tamil Nadu or its officers or instrumentalities including police to prevent screening of film,\" the court said.\n\nThe bench said it would watch the film in July when it takes up hearing of appeals against the decisions of high courts of Kerala and Madras refusing to entertain pleas for banning the film.\n\nIt said that it will define the parameters and contours of free speech even as advocate Huzefa Ahmadi said that the continuance of screening of the film would create a deep divide in the society even if it may not result in physical violence.\n\nSenior advocate Harish Salve, who was appearing for the producer of the movie, argued that states cannot sit in appeal over the grant of certification to the movie.\n\nSolicitor general Tushar Mehta said the film is being screened all over India and the apprehensions against it are fictional. Mehta said those who do not want to watch the film can choose to do so.\n\nThe Supreme Court said it will define the doctrine as to what could be permissible and impermissible in a film.\n\nMeanwhile, the film producer, at the insistence of the SC, said it would add to the present disclaimer that \"the filmmaker has no authentic data to back the figure of 32,000 conversions of Hindu and Christians to Islam\" and that the content is a fictionalized account.\n\nOn Friday, the top court had sought replies from the West Bengal and Tamil Nadu governments on a separate plea of the producers of \"The Kerala Story\" that the movie is not being shown in theatres in these two states.\n\nWhile West Bengal has banned the movie after three days of its screening in theatres, Tamil Nadu has not banned the film but the exhibitors have withdrawn from cinema halls owing to security concerns.",

    "vclaim": "The Supreme Court stayed West Bengal government's ban on the movie \"The Kerala Story\", allowing theatres to screen the film. The Supreme Court stated that states must maintain law and order instead of banning CBFC-certified films. The film producer agreed to add a disclaimer stating they have no authentic data to support the claim of 32,000 religious conversions. While West Bengal banned the movie after three days, Tamil Nadu theatres withdrew the film due to security concerns despite no official ban.",
