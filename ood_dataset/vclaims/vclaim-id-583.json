This exceptional performance secured their spot in the final round of the World Athletics Championships in Budapest, marking a historic achievement.\n\nComprising the talented quartet of Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Amoj Jacob, Muhammed Ajmal Variyathodi, and Rajesh Ramesh, the Indian team secured a second-place finish in heat number one, trailing only behind the USA with a time of 2:58.47.\n\nThis triumphant effort guaranteed their participation in the final scheduled for Sunday. The qualification criteria dictated that the top three finishers from each of the two heats, along with the subsequent two fastest times, would advance to the final.\n\nThis extraordinary feat not only earned the team a coveted place in the final but also saw them break the previous Asian record of 2:59.51, which was held by the Japanese team. Moreover, this outstanding achievement eclipsed the earlier national record of 3:00.25 that had been set in 2021.\n\nThe Indians gave the world record holders Americans a run for their money, finishing closely behind them. India eventually finished second overall after the two heats, behind USA, but ahead of strong teams like Great Britain (3rd; 2:59.42) and Jamaica (5th; 2:59.82).",
