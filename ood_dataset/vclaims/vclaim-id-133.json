    "full_text": "ALTERED: These videos claiming to show Kenya's deputy president making a strongly-worded speech against communities are doctored\n\nThe videos have been edited to remove keywords and add inaccurate subtitles in his campaign speech in Uasin Gishu County.\n\nVideos shared on Twitter and Facebook claiming to show Kenya's Deputy President, William Ruto, inciting communities are ALTERED.\n\nThe first is a 16-second video, and shows the DP at a campaign rally selling himself to electorates ahead of the 9 August 2022 general elections. Another version of the doctored video is 39-second long and has been shared.\n\nThe chyron on the lower third is branded in the colours and logo of Ruto's party, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA). It also indicates the footage is being filmed in Uasin Gishu County.\n\nIn both videos, the DP speaks against members of some Kenyan communities.\n\nThe video begins with Ruto making remarks in Kalenjin, with Swahili subtitles running on the bottom of the screen.\n\n\"Hiyo ni kitu kidogo na waache ujinga na upuzi hapa ni kwetu na sisi ndio kusema (That is a non-issue and they should stop their nonsense and stupidity. This is our land and we are the ones who call the shots),\" read the terse subtitles in part.\n\nHowever, PesaCheck determined that even the Swahili subtitles are inaccurate on both videos. The correct English translation of the 39-second-long video reads, \"Agreed? We want peace, I plead with you. The other camp knows we are winning. Because they know this for a fact, they are people to mislead: they are creating a ruse, by distributing pamphlets etc. But I want to ask you, don't fall for it (propaganda). We want peace with everyone. People from across Kenya will be voting for us.\"\n\nAs the speech continues, Ruto switches to English and then Swahili. \"The people from Western Kenya who are here, the people from Nyanza who are here, the people from Central who are here, shame on you! Na tutawashitaki kwa Mungu mukituletea kisirani yenu. Na mukwende Kabisa. (We will report you to God if you bring us your anger. Depart from us),\" Ruto is heard saying.\n\nThe 16-second video was shared by the Governor of Mombasa, Hassan Joho, along with a post which reads, \"Completely unacceptable! It is just not right. This is now dangerous. Someone remind Ruto that Kenya is a country for all of us. Live where you want and vote your choice freely.\"\n\nThe post by Joho, was met with incredulous responses online, with some tweeps sharing a differently worded speech by Ruto at the event preaching peace. Twitter has since pulled down the tweet for violating the platform's community guidelines.\n\nA review of the full footage of Ruto's speech in Uasin Gishu on 1 August 2022 reveals that the DP did not speak against any of the communities mentioned as claimed. Instead, the video shared by Joho excludes parts of the DP's speech.\n\nIn the unedited speech, Ruto speaks against people sowing seeds of discord and are opposed to community integration.\n\n\"The Kalenjins who are here, the people from Western Kenya who are here, the people from Nyanza who are here, the people from Central who are here, the people from all parts of Kenya who are here, they belong to Uasin Gishu, and their home is Uasin Gishu. And this Uasin Gishu is the home of every Kenyan. And we want to tell those who want to divide us, shame on you! Na tutawashitaki kwa mungu mukituleta kisirani yenu, na mukwende kabisa,\" the DP is heard saying.\n\nDirector of Communications in Ruto's Presidential Campaign, Hussein Mohamed, also dismissed the doctored videos and shared the correct version of the DP's speech.\n\nPesaCheck has examined the video claiming to show Kenya's Deputy President, William Ruto, making a strongly-worded speech against communities and found it to be ALTERED.",

    "vclaim": "Videos shared on social media purportedly showing Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto making inflammatory remarks against certain communities were doctored with inaccurate subtitles and edited content. The original unedited speech shows Ruto actually promoting peace and community integration in Uasin Gishu County, stating it is home to all Kenyans. The altered videos removed key context and added false Swahili subtitles to make it appear Ruto was speaking against certain Kenyan communities during his campaign speech.",
