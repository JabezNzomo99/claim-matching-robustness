    "full_text": "Experts Say Proposed Vehicle Emissions and Fuel Rules Not an EPA 'Ban' on Gas-Powered Cars\n\nUpdate, May 14: On March 20, the EPA announced its finalized pollution standards for light- and medium-duty vehicles, such as passenger cars, light trucks, larger pickups and vans. Then on March 29, the agency announced its finalized pollution standards for heavy-duty vehicles, which include delivery trucks and school buses. The new standards are for model years 2027 through 2032 and will remain in place thereafter until new rules are adopted.\n\nPending regulations under review by the Biden administration could greatly increase the number of electric vehicles sold in the U.S. But if implemented, the proposals to reduce tailpipe emissions and raise the fuel efficiency standards of cars and trucks would not \"ban\" the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles, as a trade group for fuel makers falsely suggests in an ad campaign.\n\nPolicy experts told FactCheck.org that carmakers \u2013 particularly under the suggested federal regulations \u2013 would have flexibility in how they meet the proposed requirements, including by making vehicles with internal combustion engines more efficient.\n\n\"Requiring vehicles to be more efficient and emit less is something that regulators in the US have done for decades, and automakers are free to comply with those standards in whatever strategy works best for them,\" John Helveston, a George Washington University assistant professor of engineering management and systems engineering, said in an email.\n\nTwo ads airing in seven states and the Washington, D.C., area give viewers the impression that cars that run on gas soon will not be allowed to be made and sold in the U.S. The ads are part of a reported $7 million issue-ad campaign the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers began on Feb. 12.\n\n\"We don't all live in cities, but President Biden's EPA is rushing to ban new gas-powered cars even though some of us drive long distances, live too far from a charger, or can't afford an expensive electric vehicle,\" say the narrators in the AFPM ad titled \"All of Us.\"\n\nIn the other ad, called \"Open Roads,\" a narrator makes an identical claim, adding that the Environmental Protection Agency \"wants to end\" the \"freedom to travel where you want\" and \"how to get there.\"\n\nThe article then goes on to detail three key proposals:\n\n1. EPA's Proposed Emissions Rule\n2. DOT's Proposed Fuel Standards\n3. California's Plan for Zero-Emissions Vehicles\n\nExperts consistently emphasized that these proposals do not constitute a ban on gas-powered vehicles. As Kenneth Gillingham from Yale University stated, \"In short, all three [proposals] would allow gas-powered cars to remain on the road \u2013 they would just have to be much more efficient than the cars today.\"\n\nThe EPA's proposed standards would potentially require electric vehicles to account for 67% of new light-duty vehicle sales and 46% of new medium-duty vehicle sales by 2032, but manufacturers would have multiple compliance pathways, including improving internal combustion engine efficiency.\n\nExperts like Arthur van Benthem from the Wharton School and Jeremy Michalek from Carnegie Mellon University agree that while the standards are strict, they do not represent an outright ban on gasoline vehicles.\n\nThe fact-check concludes that the proposed regulations aim to accelerate electric vehicle adoption and reduce emissions, but do not prohibit the sale of new gasoline-powered cars.",
