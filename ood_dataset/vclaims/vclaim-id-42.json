    "full_text": "Fact Check: Did Russian defence minister advise Indians in Ukraine to display Indian flag for special protection?\n\nWe found that the claim of Russian Defence Minister, General Sergey Shoygu, advising stranded Indians in Ukraine to display India's flag in front of their cars to receive special protection from its army is not true.\n\nAlthough it is true that the Union Government has advised Indians to carry the national flag while moving outside, no such communication has yet been conveyed by the Russian government.\n\nKey Details:\n- A Hindi postcard featuring General Sergey Shoygu went viral on social media\n- The postcard claimed Russian soldiers would not harm Indians displaying the Indian flag\n- The postcard also included praise for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\n\nVerification Process:\n- Checked Economic Times report about Union Minister G Kishan Reddy advising Indian students to carry national flag\n- Reviewed ANI tweet with advisory from Embassy of India in Budapest\n- Searched Google for relevant keywords about Russia and Ukraine\n- Checked official Twitter handles of Indian Embassies in Ukraine and Russia\n\nConclusion:\nWhile the Indian Government did put out an advisory to carry the national flag, nothing similar has been stated by the Russian defence minister. The claim circulating on social media is FALSE.\n\nThe Indian government and embassies have been working to establish evacuation routes and provide guidance to Indian nationals in the conflict zone, but no specific communication from the Russian defence minister about flag protection exists.",
