    "full_text": "Times Now Report On Congress' Telangana Manifesto Is Misleading\n\nOn Tuesday, 27 November, the Congress released its election manifesto for Telangana, which goes to polls on 7 December. No big deal, right? Wrong. Because the manifesto was the news \u2013 nay, the prime time news \u2013 for an entire weekend.\n\nCLAIM\nOn 26 November, Times Now claimed that it had accessed the Congress' draft manifesto for Telangana, adding that the party 'has promised seven 'Muslim-only' schemes'. Times Now went really big on the coverage of the story, with the channel's Editor-in-Chief Rahul Shivshankar and Managing Editor Navika Kumar engaging in panel discussions on the issue, which they believed 'sabotaged secularism' and 'pitted Hindus against Muslims'.\n\nTRUE OR FALSE?\nThe pages from the Congress manifesto on the basis of which the channel has made its claims are, in fact, genuine. However, The Quint accessed the final manifesto and found that the pages are only one part of the manifesto \u2013 a separate section on minorities \u2013 and therefore the claims by Times Now are misleading. Moreover, several of the schemes highlighted by the channel as 'Muslim-only' are actually in the manifesto for all communities, or at least for communities from other backward groups as well.\n\nSocial media lapped up the story and it went viral, with the discourse devolving into vitriol.\n\nHere is a point-by-point counter of Times Now's claims:\n\nCLAIM 1: 'Government contracts and special opportunities for Muslim youth'\nWHAT DOES THE MANIFESTO SAY?\nThere are four categories to which the Congress has promised preference in handing out government contracts:\na) Youth who participated in the Telangana movement will be given 50% works in all government contracts.\nb) The youth, belonging to SC and ST communities, who participated in the Telangana movement will be given 50% works in all government contracts.\nc) Five percent (5%) of all government contracts will be given SC, ST and other groups.\nd) Muslim youth will be given opportunities to get government contracts so as to provide them employment.\n\nCLAIM 2: 'Rs 20 lakh financial assistance to poor Muslims students'\nThe manifesto promises financial aid to 'poor minority students' and not 'Muslims':\na) Rs 25 Lakh assistance will be given to students belonging to SC, ST, Minorities, OBC and other economically weaker sections for pursuing overseas education\nb) Poor minority students will be given Rs 20 lakh assistance for overseas education\n\nCLAIM 3: 'Special residential schools to be set up for Muslim students'\nThe Telangana government already runs residential schools for minorities:\na) Residential schools will be started in Tribal areas\nb) Special Residential Schools will be established for girls belonging to minority communities\nc) Residential Schools will be established for Christian minorities\n\nCLAIM 4: 'Hospitals only for Muslims to be established'\nThe manifesto says government hospitals will be established in minority-concentrated areas.\n\nCLAIM 5: 'Free electricity supply to all Mosques and Churches in Telangana'\nFree power supply will be given to all temples, mosques, churches and other places of worship.\n\nCLAIM 6: 'Action against private firms for denying jobs on the basis of religion'\nAll kinds of discrimination on religious grounds in giving jobs in both public and private sectors will be stopped.\n\nCLAIM 7: 'Urdu district selection panels for recruitment of Muslim teachers only'\nThe manifesto mentions:\na) A special DSC (Departmental Selection Commission) will be conducted for recruitment of Urdu teachers\nb) A Mega DSC will be held to recruit 20,000 teachers within 100 days of coming to power\n\nThe article includes a detailed rejoinder from Times Now, which maintains its original reporting while arguing that The Quint's analysis is selective.",

    "vclaim": "Times Now claimed that Congress' Telangana manifesto promised seven 'Muslim-only' schemes, which was misleading as these schemes were actually meant for multiple communities. The channel misrepresented government contract opportunities as Muslim-exclusive when they were actually promised to various groups including youth from SC, ST communities, and Telangana movement participants. Times Now incorrectly reported financial assistance of Rs 20 lakh as Muslim-specific when it was intended for all minority students. The channel misreported residential schools as Muslim-only when they were planned for various communities including tribals and Christian minorities. Times Now falsely claimed hospitals would be exclusively for Muslims when the manifesto only stated they would be established in minority-concentrated areas. The free electricity supply was misreported as being only for mosques and churches when it was actually meant for all places of worship including temples. The channel incorrectly portrayed the Urdu teacher recruitment initiative as Muslim-only when it was part of a larger teacher recruitment drive.",
