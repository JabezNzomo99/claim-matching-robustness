Rafi is going viral on social media along with the claim that the singer is from Kenya. Newschecker found this claim to be untrue.\n\nThe video has been posted on Facebook by user Pramod S Sharma along with the caption 'This African Singer is from Kenya. He is a Black Kenyan. Just close your eyes and listen to his voice. Just Amazing'.\n\nNewschecker found similar claims on Facebook with similar captions.\n\nFact Check/Verification:\n\nWe started our investigation by conducting a keyword search with the words used in the caption- \"This African Singer is from Kenya. He is a Black Kenyan. Just close your eyes and listen to his voice\" on Google. Newschecker found the same video posted on Youtube channel anurranga jaisalmer in March 2018 with the same caption.\n\nOn analysing the comment section of the video, Newschecker found a comment by user Bali Brahmbhatt, who pointed out the name of the singer Sanjay Sawant. We noticed that several other users had also pointed out the same.\n\nUpon conducting a keyword search with the words \"Sanjay Sawant\" and \"Na kisi ki aankh ka noor hoon\" on Google, Newschecker found the original version of the video uploaded by channel named Jagruti Films on 9th January, 2021 along with the title 'Na Kisi Ki Aankh Ka Noor Hoon \u2013 Rafi \u2013 Laal Quila 1960 \u2013 Old Hindi Songs \u2013 Old Songs Hits Hindi'.\n\nUpon checking the comments section of the video, Newschecker found a comment by user Arun Mishra seeking to know the identity of the singer, to which the channel responded by clarifying that the singer is Sanjay Sawant.\n\nNewschecker further reached the channel Jagruti films based on the contact information that was available on the page, who confirmed to us that the singer was indeed Sanjay Sawant. Speaking to Newschecker, Sittu Kumar from Bhuj based Jagruti Films said that the video is from an event that was organised in Ahmedabad in 2014, called 'Sangeet Sandhya', where singers congregate to sing old film songs for the audience.\n\nUpon further investigation, Newschecker found the official Facebook page of Sanjay Sawant, and found posts featuring the same man seen in the viral video. \"Sanjay has been in the singing profession for more than 20 Years.
