This is common with phishing scams.\n\nWe performed a WHOIS domain search of the website in question to authenticate the offer's validity. The site was registered on 31 July 2000 in California, United States of America.\n\nThe purported offer neither appears on Safaricom's website, nor on its official Facebook page, or Twitter and Instagram accounts.\n\nSafaricom's Communications Business Partner Dennis Kioko dismissed the purported offer as fraudulent.\n\n\"This is fraudulent. Our websites are safaricom.co.ke and safaricom.com,\" Kioko responded to our queries in an email.\n\nPesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a link to a website claiming that Kenya's telecommunication company Safaricom is offering free data for old sim card users and finds it to be a HOAX.",

    "vclaim": "A Facebook post falsely claims that Safaricom is offering free data (5GB for six-month-old SIM cards and 10GB for one-year-old SIM cards) to users with old SIM cards. The fraudulent offer requires users to share the link with WhatsApp groups or friends to claim the data, which is a common phishing scam tactic. Safaricom's Communications Business Partner has officially confirmed that this offer is fraudulent and not associated with their official websites.",
