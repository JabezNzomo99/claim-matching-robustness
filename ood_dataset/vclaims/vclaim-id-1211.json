    "full_text": "NEET-UG paper leak: CBI arrests principal, vice principal of Jharkhand school\n\nThe CBI on Friday arrested the principal and vice principal of a school in Jharkhand's Hazaribagh in connection with the NEET-UG paper leak case, officials said.\n\nEhsanul Haque, the principal of Oasis School, was made the city coordinator of Hazaribagh for the medical entrance exam conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on May 5.\n\nVice Principal Imtiaz Alam was designated as the NTA's observer and the centre coordinator at the Oasis School. The CBI is also questioning five more people from the district in connection with the paper leak case.\n\nThe probe agency arrested Haque and Alam after detailed questioning. Both came under scanner during a probe by the Bihar Police's Economic Offences Unit (EOU), which was investigating the case earlier. The team had found burnt question papers of NEET-UG during a raid at a hideout of the solver gang.\n\nThe EOU claimed the \"leaked\" NEET-UG question paper was allegedly obtained from the Oasis School in Hazaribagh by the notorious Sanjeev Kumar alias Lutan Mukhiya gang. Investigators matched a partially burnt question paper found in the Patna safe house with the reference question paper provided by the NTA, confirming the leak's origin.\n\nAccording to officials, the probe showed that laid down guidelines for opening the question paper boxes were not properly followed by the authorities in Hazaribagh.\n\nHaque has maintained that the box carrying the question papers could not be opened because its digital lock malfunctioned. He claims he contacted the NTA, which asked him to use a cutter to open the box.\n\nThe boxes carrying question papers have two locks - a manual one that must be opened with a key and cutter, and a digital lock that opens with a beep sound 45 minutes before the examination.\n\nThe CBI has registered six FIRs in the NEET-UG paper leak case, including its own FIR on a reference from the Union Education Ministry and five from the states where it took over the investigation.\n\nNEET-UG is conducted by NTA for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH and other related courses in government and private institutions across the country. This year's exam was conducted on May 5 at 4,750 centres in 571 cities, including 14 abroad. Over 23 lakh candidates appeared for the test.\n\nThe first CBI FIR was registered on Sunday, a day after the ministry announced it would hand over the probe into the alleged irregularities in the conduct of the exam to the central agency.",
