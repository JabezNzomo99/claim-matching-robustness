    "full_text": "Did Wikileaks Release a List of Black Money Holders in Swiss Bank?\n\nCLAIM:\nA message is being circulated on social media with the claim that WikiLeaks has published the \"first list of black money holders in SWISS bank\". The message mentions top 30 members which includes Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Akhilesh Yadav, Shashi Tharoor, Mayawati among others. It also alleges that Indian black money in Swiss bank amounts to Rs 1.3 trillion dollars. Several social media users shared the message on Facebook and Twitter with the same claim.\n\nWHAT'S THE TRUTH?\nWikiLeaks published their last report on 30 January 2019 on set of documents from the Catholic Church. There is no mention of any report on black money holders in Swiss bank.\n\nFurther, a search on TweetDeck using keywords 'wikileaks indian money' found a tweet shared by WikiLeaks in 2011 where the organization had issued a clarification on a different version of the same message.\n\nOn August 5, 2011, WikiLeaks tweeted: \"WARNING: WikiLeaks and Indian black money: The following is a FAKE image and never appeared on WikiLeaks\"\n\nMESSAGE VIRAL SINCE 2011\nThis is not the first time that the message has gone viral. It has been doing the rounds since 2011, with multiple tweets sharing similar claims about a supposed WikiLeaks list of black money holders.\n\n(The Quint encourages readers to verify information and can be contacted at 9643651818 or webqoof@thequint.com for fact-checking queries.)",

    "vclaim": "A viral message claims WikiLeaks published a list of top 30 black money holders in Swiss banks, including prominent Indian politicians like Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. The message falsely states that Indian black money in Swiss banks amounts to Rs 1.3 trillion dollars. WikiLeaks has officially denied publishing any such list of Indian black money holders in Swiss banks through a tweet in 2011. This false message has been circulating on social media since 2011 despite being debunked.",
