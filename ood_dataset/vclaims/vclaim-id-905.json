A relevant keyword search revealed that it is a capsule manufactured by City Pharmaceutical Laboratories in Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes of the clip showing the second capsule led to a YouTube video dated February 18, 2021, titled \"FirstNigeriaTV: Man finds nails inside capsule drug for consumption\".\n\nAfter translating the text found on the packet with the help of Google Lens, we learnt that was an \"Enterofuril\" capsule, manufactured by Bosnia and Herzegovina-based Bosnalijek, proving that the capsules are not from India.\n\nConclusion:\nViral video showing nails hidden in capsules was found to be a combination of two separate clips of pills manufactured in Pakistan and Bosnia and Herzegovina, not India.\n\nResult: False\n\nSources:\n- City Pharmaceuticals website\n- YouTube video, FirstNigeriaTV, February 18, 2021\n- Vidal.ru website",
