    "full_text": "Fact Check: Are senior citizen concessions back in Indian Railways? Viral post is a hoax\n\nThe viral claim that Indian railways will resume concessions in ticket pricing for senior citizens from July 1 is a hoax. No such decision has been announced by the Ministry of Railway.\n\nClaim:\nIndian Railways will resume discounts on ticket pricing for senior citizens from July 1. The viral post claimed concessions would be 40% for males above 60 and 50% for females above 58.\n\nFact:\nThis viral claim is false. No such decision has been announced by the Indian Railways or the Ministry of Railways.\n\nKey Details:\n1. Rajeev Jain, ADG Public Relations, Ministry of Railways, categorically denied the viral post, calling it \"fake news\".\n\n2. On May 19, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stated that senior citizen concessions could not be resumed because Railways was already operating at a subsidized rate.\n\n3. Vaishnaw emphasized: \"For every Rs. 100 spent towards operational expenses, the Railways collects only Rs. 45 from a passenger. We have to contribute to keeping the railways a sustainable mode of transport.\"\n\n4. In March, the Railway Minister told the Lok Sabha that there were no plans to restore rail concessions for senior citizens.\n\n5. A Facebook page \"Rail Mail\" initially spread the claim but later retracted and apologized for the error.\n\nBackground:\n- Before the pandemic, Indian Railways offered concessions ranging from 25% to 100% across 53 categories.\n- Since March 20, 2020, most concessions were discontinued, with exceptions only for four categories of Divyangjan, 11 categories of patients, and students.\n\nThe Press Information Bureau has also fact-checked and confirmed that such posts have no factual basis.\n\nConclusion: The viral claim about senior citizen railway concessions resuming from July 1 is completely false.",
