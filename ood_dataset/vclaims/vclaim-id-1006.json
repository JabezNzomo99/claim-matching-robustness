    "full_text": "Debunking the Seismic Waves Card: Can It Really Hack Your Phone in Seconds?\n\nClaim: File called Seismic Waves CARD, allegedly circulated as photos of Morocco earthquake, will hack your phone in 10 seconds\n\nFact: The viral claim regarding the 'Seismic Waves Card' files' ability to hack your phone in ten seconds appears to be unfounded and should be regarded as a baseless rumour. There is no such malware or browser hack.\n\nFollowing the tragic earthquake in Morocco, a surge of false information has swept across the internet, with the latest rumor surrounding the so-called 'Seismic Waves Card.'\n\nThis mysterious file is purportedly capable of hacking your phone within seconds of being opened, a claim that has gone viral on social media platforms, especially WhatsApp, where users are cautioning one another against opening this file.\n\nThe warning circulating on social media reads: \"They are going to upload some photos of the Moroccan earthquake on WhatsApp. The file is called Seismic Waves CARD, don't open it and see it, it will hack your phone in 10 seconds and it cannot be stopped in any way. Share the information with your family and friends. DO NOT OPEN IT. They also said it on TV\".\n\nNewschecker has received numerous requests via our WhatsApp tipline to fact-check this viral message.\n\nHere's what we discovered during our fact-check:\n\nNewschecker began by conducting a keyword search on Google using the term 'Seismic waves card' which yielded several search results. However, there was no concrete proof to substantiate the existence of such a malware or browser hack.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that the message refers to a 'forward' that no one has seen or read. It is alarmist in nature and fits into the classic template of fake news.\n\nOne of the top results, an article by tech news firm Tech Arp has labelled the claim a hoax.\n\nAccording to their report, \"The Seismic Waves Card is an Internet hoax that keeps getting recycled for every earthquake that comes along.\" The reports cite instances of similar messages that have gone viral in context of other earthquakes that happened in the recent past.\n\nFurthermore, the viral message claims that photos are shared on WhatsApp, and that opening them will lead to your phone being hacked within ten seconds.\n\nIn reality, photos sent on WhatsApp are transmitted as image files. Even if you were to download an image, it would not trigger any hacks since hacks typically require some user interaction to occur.\n\nThe Tech Arp article explains that while it is possible to embed malicious code within a photo using a technique called digital steganography, this would not result in a full-fledged malware that can execute by itself. \"At most, it can be used to hide the malware payload from antivirus scanners,\u2026 but it cannot hack your smartphone by itself,\" the article on Tech Arp notes.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that malicious codes execution happens instantaneously and does not require a specific time frame as the viral message claims. There have been no credible reports or mentions of such a hack on television either, contrary to what the viral message suggests.\n\nFor further insights, we reached out to Hitesh Dharamdasani, cybersecurity expert, who confirmed that the viral message appears to be fake and dubious. \"Generally such messages have a call to action, and are sent with the purpose of distributing malware,\" he said, also noting that the absence of any attachment in the message raises suspicions about its legitimacy.\n\nConclusion:\nThe viral claim regarding the 'Seismic Waves Card' files' ability to hack your phone in ten seconds appears to be unfounded and should be regarded as a baseless rumour. There is no such malware or browser hack.\n\nRating: False",

    "vclaim": "A viral message claims that a file called \"Seismic Waves CARD\" containing Morocco earthquake photos will hack your phone in 10 seconds if opened. Photos sent through WhatsApp cannot automatically hack phones as they require user interaction for any malicious code to execute. While it's possible to hide malicious code in photos through digital steganography, such code cannot execute automatically to hack a smartphone by itself. The \"Seismic Waves CARD\" warning is a recycled hoax that has been circulated during previous earthquakes.",
