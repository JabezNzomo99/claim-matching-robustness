    "full_text": "Qatar accepts India's appeal against death penalty to 8 ex-Navy personnel: Sources\n\nA Qatari court on Thursday accepted the appeal filed by the Indian government in connection with the death penalty given to eight ex-Indian Navy personnel by a court last month.\n\nThe court said that they are studying the appeal and the next hearing is expected soon, sources told India Today.\n\nOn October 26, Qatar's Court of First Instance awarded the death sentence to the eight men, who used to work with private company Al Dahra Global Technologies and Consultancy Services and were arrested in August 2022.\n\nHowever, neither the Qatari authorities nor New Delhi made the charges against the Indian nationals public. When the news of death penalty emerged, India had described the ruling as \"deeply\" shocking and vowed to explore all legal options in the case.\n\nOn November 16, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that India is engaged with the Qatari authorities on the matter and that the government will continue to extend all legal and consular assistance to the former Navy personnel.\n\n\"The case is currently in a legal process there. As we mentioned, an appeal has been filed in Qatar's Court of appeal,\" Arindam Bagchi said in his weekly media briefing last week.\n\n\"I would again urge everyone not to engage in speculation considering the sensitive nature of the case,\" he said.\n\nIn August 2022, Qatar detained eight former Indian Navy officers on suspicion of working as spies for Israel while they were employed by a company based in the Middle Eastern nation. The former officers \u2014 Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Captain Saurabh Vasisht, Commander Amit Nagpal, Commander Purnendu Tiwari, Commander Sugunakar Pakala, Commander Sanjeev Gupta, and Sailor Ragesh \u2014 were arrested by Qatar intelligence agency from Doha on August 30, 2022.\n\nThe bail pleas of the Navy veterans were rejected several times by Qatari authorities. The death penalty was announced by the Court of First Instance of Qatar in October this year.",
