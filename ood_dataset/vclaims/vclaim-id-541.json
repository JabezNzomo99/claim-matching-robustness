    "full_text": "A post is being shared on Facebook with a claim that the New York Times has written a beautiful article on India while newspapers and media channels in India deplore it. Let's try to check the authenticity of the post.\n\nClaim: V Mitchell has written a beautiful article on India in the New York Times.\n\nFact: No, that is not an article published by the New York Times. It was just a comment by V Mitchell in the comment section under a different New York Times article, in the year 2009. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the article on Google with keywords from the post, a link to the New York Times article can be found in the search results. The article was titled 'As Elections Near, Tightrope Awaits in India'; written by Somini Sengupta and published on April 14, 2009. The author commented on Indian elections but nothing related to the information given in the post. But, the same words from the post can be found in the comment section of the article. The man who commented was V Mitchell. So, a man who commented on an article in the New York Times is being portrayed as the author of the New York Times article in the post.\n\nNot only Facebook users but also the Ministry of External Affairs on its website placed the comment of V Mitchell in the 'Articles in Foreign Media' section.\n\nTo sum it up, a comment on the New York Times article is being portrayed as an article in the newspaper.",

    "vclaim": "A viral post falsely claims that V Mitchell wrote an article praising India in the New York Times, when it was actually just a comment he made on a different NYT article from 2009. The Ministry of External Affairs website incorrectly listed V Mitchell's comment under their 'Articles in Foreign Media' section.",
