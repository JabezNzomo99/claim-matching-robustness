Efforts are underway to achieve a ceasefire in the remaining areas as well, according to an official.\n\nThe tribal fighters have abandoned their trenches, which are now under the control of law enforcement.\n\nThe clashes, which originated from a land dispute between the two tribes four days ago, quickly spread to other areas, including Peewar, Tangi, Balishkhel, Khaar Kalay, Maqbal, Kunj Alizai, Para Chamkani, and Karman. Local residents reported that the rival tribes were using heavy and sophisticated weapons, such as mortar shells and rocket launchers, against each other. They also mentioned that mortar and rocket shells were fired on Parachinar and Sadda, the main cities in the Kurram tribal district.\n\n\"There were at least four waves of attacks in last night's gunbattle resulting in more casualties,\" an official said.\n\nThe ongoing violence has disrupted daily life in the affected areas, with all educational institutions and markets closed and traffic on main roads suspended during the day. To maintain order and security, heavy contingents of police and security forces have been deployed in the affected areas, as stated by officials.",
