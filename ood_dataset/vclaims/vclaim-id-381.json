The video has been viewed more than 2 million times and has garnered thousands of reactions. \n\n\"This is the political party saying only their figures were accurate but other political parties rigged. It is the barefaced lies and audacity with which they carry on their propaganda that is very befuddling! They will soon discover the difference b/w propaganda & judicial analyses,\" he said in a caption for the video.\n\nVerification\n\nThe CDD Election War Room examined the video and discovered that it is a pre-election drill involving sample ballot papers. Watermarks that read \"specimen\" were prominently inked on the ballot papers that were being thumb printed.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) frequently provides sample ballots to political parties and other stakeholders. This enables them to educate the electorate on how to vote properly and accurately on election day, as well as how to avoid casting an invalid vote. \n\nINEC stated in 2019 through its Director of Voter Education that specimen ballot papers differ from the originals because they lack the security features that the originals have. \n\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, the Labour Party held a series of voter education events, which were widely shared on social media. \n\nVerdict\n\nThe claim that the video shows the Labour Party coercing Nigerians to vote and manipulating votes in the party's favour is false.",

    "vclaim": "A video shared by APC spokesperson Festus Keyamo allegedly showing Labour Party coercing Nigerians to vote for Peter Obi was actually a pre-election drill using sample ballot papers marked as \"specimen\". The video shows legitimate voter education activities using INEC-provided specimen ballots, not vote manipulation or coercion.",
