    "full_text": "Narayan Murthy recalls how Kareena Kapoor 'ignored fans' on flight in old viral video\n\nAn old video of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy has once again grabbed the internet's attention. Therein, he talked about none other than Kareena Kapoor. He said how Kareena ignored fans on a flight who wanted to interact with her. He discussed this incident during a talk at IIT-Kanpur. Murthy expressed his surprise at the actress' indifference towards her fans.\n\n\"The other day I was coming from London, and next to me was Kareena Kapoor, sitting in her seat. So many people came to her and said hello. She didn't even bother to react,\" said Narayana Murthy.\n\n\"I was a little bit surprised. Whoever came to me, I stood up, and we discussed for a minute or half a minute-that's all they were expecting,\" Murthy added.\n\nHis wife, Sudha Murthy, interjected during the discussion, defending Kareena by saying, \"She has millions of admirers. She might have been tired.\" Her comment was met with applause and laughter from the audience. She further added that while a software person like Murthy might have around 10,000 fans, a film actor like her could have millions.\n\nDespite his wife's defense, Murthy continued to stress the importance of acknowledging affection from fans, even if it's just a brief response, as a way to keep one's ego in check.\n\nMeanwhile, Kareena Kapoor, who recently celebrated her 23rd year in the film industry, is looking forward to her upcoming projects. She will be seen next in Rhea Kapoor's film \"The Crew,\" alongside Tabu, Kriti Sanon, and Diljit Dosanjh.",
