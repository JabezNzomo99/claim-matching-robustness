    "full_text": "Video Of Indian Men's Relay Team Qualifying For 2023 World Athletics Finals Falsely Linked To Paris Olympics\n\nClaim:\nIndian men's 4X400 men's relay team qualifies for the finals at the ongoing 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nFact:\nNewschecker first ran a keyword search for \"India 4\u00d7400 relay Paris Olympics\", which did not throw up any credible news reports. Also, we learnt that the event is scheduled for August 9 and August 11, proving that the video is of an old race. The track and field events are scheduled to be held from August 1 to August 11.\n\nNewschecker noticed that the commentator stated (at 03:51) that it was India's first time qualifying for the World Championship final in the event. Taking a cue from this, we ran a relevant keyword search, which led us to an NDTV news report, dated August 27, 2023, stating that the quartet of Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Amoj Jacob, Muhammed Ajmal Variyathodi, and Rajesh Ramesh helped India shatter the Asian record, clocking 2 minutes and 59.05 seconds to qualify for its maiden final round of the World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary. Similar reports can be seen in other news sources, adding that the team finished fifth in the final of the 2023 World Athletics Championships.\n\nThe viral video had also been shared by TMC's Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien on August 27, 2023, hailing the team's achievement, thus confirming that the clip is not related to the ongoing Olympics in Paris. We learnt that the Indian men's and women's 4x400m teams secured Paris 2024 Olympic quotas at the World Athletics Relays 24 in Nassau, Bahamas earlier this year.\n\nConclusion:\nOld video of India's 4X400 men's relay qualifying for the World Athletics Championship finals in Hungary is being falsely shared as the ongoing 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nResult: False",

    "vclaim": "A video showing Indian men's 4x400m relay team qualifying for the 2023 World Athletics Championships finals in Budapest is being misrepresented as qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympics finals. The Indian men's 4x400m relay team actually secured their Paris 2024 Olympic quotas at the World Athletics Relays in Nassau, Bahamas, not in the viral video.",
