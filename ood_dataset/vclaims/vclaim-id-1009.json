    "full_text": "A post is going viral on social media platforms, claiming that the Congress National President, Mallikarjun Kharge, asked Prime Minister Modi to allocate at least one cent of the land to the Dalit community in Parliament. In response, Modi allegedly revealed details of Kharge's assets worth hundreds of crores in the country.\n\nClaim: PM Modi revealed Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge's illegal property worth hundreds of crores in Parliament.\n\nFact: There are no credible reports suggesting that PM Modi mentioned Mallikarjun Kharge's property details in Parliament. A search on the official website of the Lok Sabha confirmed that Kharge did not ask PM Modi to allocate at least one cent of land to his Dalit community, and in response, Modi did not discuss the details of Kharge's assets. Moreover, we found that this viral claim has been circulating on social media since at least 2017. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWe conducted a relevant keyword search to verify the viral claim, but this search did not yield any credible reports supporting the claim. If PM Modi had revealed a list of illegal properties worth hundreds of crores owned by Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge in Parliament, it would have undoubtedly garnered significant media attention. During this search, we found that this viral claim has been circulating on social media since at least 2017.\n\nWe then checked the Lok Sabha's official website to determine whether Mallikarjun Kharge had asked Narendra Modi to allocate at least one cent of land to his Dalit community between 2014 and 2019. However, we did not find any reports suggesting that Kharge had asked Modi such a question.\n\nWe then also searched the Lok Sabha website and Rajya Sabha website to determine if Modi has mentioned the property details of Kharge on any other occasion. However, we did not find any records of Modi discussing the details of Kharge's assets.\n\nDuring the Karnataka assembly elections in 2018, Modi addressed the public at a rally in Gulbarga and asked them if they knew the extent of the Kharge family's wealth. Even during this meeting, Modi did not discuss the details of Kharge's property.\n\nAccording to reports, a person named Ratnakar filed a complaint with the Karnataka State Lokayukta in 2014, alleging that Kharge illegally acquired \u20b950,000 crore worth of property. However, the truth behind these allegations remains unclear and unproven. Meanwhile, in his 2020 Rajya Sabha election affidavit, Kharge stated that his family's assets amount to \u20b920.12 crore, with debts totalling \u20b923.75 lakhs.\n\nTo sum up, there is no evidence to suggest that PM Modi mentioned Mallikarjun Kharge's property details in Parliament.",
