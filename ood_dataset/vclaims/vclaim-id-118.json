If not managed using antiretroviral therapy (ART), it leads to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), which further weakens one's immune system, making them vulnerable to many infections and diseases.\n\nA WhatsApp number is then provided for those interested in purchasing the herbal treatment.\n\nTo verify the veracity of the claim, PesaCheck looked at several research papers and found no scientific evidence that Jatropha Curcas Linn and Cassava can cure HIV. Only black seed has shown promising potential, in limited studies, in treating HIV.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Virology and Biochemistry at Haffkine Institute, Mumbai, India, used samples of potentially drug-resistant HIV-1 to assess the anti-HIV activity of Jatropha Curcas Linn leaf extracts. Jatropha Curcas Linn showed antiviral activity, and entry inhibition activity against potentially drug-resistant HIV-1. This means Jatropha Curcas Linn has the capability of suppressing the virus and preventing it from multiplying. However, there is no evidence that the plant can cure HIV.\n\nJatropha Curcas Linn is a drought-resistant perennial plant that is found in the wild and semi-cultivated areas such as Central and South America, Africa, India, and Southeast Asia.\n\nAll parts of Jatropha such as the seeds, leaves, and bark have been used for traditional medicine and veterinary purposes for many years. Some of the medicinal purposes include antitumor activities, molluscicidal, insecticidal, and fungicidal properties.\n\nThere is also no scientific evidence that the leaves, roots, and bark of cassava can cure HIV.\n\nThe final part of the claim, which states that black seed can cure HIV, could be partially true. A study alleges to have cured a HIV-positive person using a black seed (Nigella sativa) concoction. The patient was put on 10 ml of the black seed concoction twice a day for six months. After 187 days, the patient was seronegative.\n\nHowever, that was one isolated case and more studies need to be done on a large group of people to conclude that black seed can cure HIV.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) maintains that there is no cure for HIV, and urges all people living with the viral disease to take ARV drugs regardless of clinical status, or CD4 cell count. ART, WHO says, does not cure HIV, but suppresses viral replication and makes one's immune system strong enough to fight off opportunistic infections.\n\nPesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post claiming that the leaves, roots, and bark of Jatropha curcas, cassava, and black seed can cure HIV and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.",

One study reported a single case where black seed (Nigella sativa) treatment resulted in HIV seronegativity, but more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness. The World Health Organization maintains there is no cure for HIV and recommends antiretroviral therapy as the primary treatment.",
