Let us leave it to scientists to figure out how it has been transmitted...however, ours is a tropical country and once the temperature crosses 35-36 degrees celsius, no virus will survive.\n\n\"Let us pray to God that winter ends and temperature rises,\" he said.\n\nThere are at least 29 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in India.\n\nAmid apprehensions that the infection could spread through eating chicken, mutton and seafood, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) CEO said there is a misconception about it.\n\n\"There is a misconception that coronavirus will spread through chicken, mutton and seafood. There is nothing like that. It is scientifically not proven.\n\n\"I am a scientist, I will not buy this argument,\" Ayyangar told reporters here.\n\nAyyangar, who was earlier with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said it is a matter of time that vaccine for coronavirus will be developed as India has a good track of handling viruses.\n\n\"Whether it is Ebola virus or Avian flu, we have handled them very well. It is a matter of time. We have to take precaution. We have to be on our toes,\" he said.\n\nUrging people to take precautions, he said coronavirus is like many other viruses and developing a vaccine will depend on the complexity of the virus.\n\nThe government is making all efforts to isolate the virus. \"Once we are able to isolate the virus, then it takes sometime to find a vaccine to counter the virus,\" he said at an event organised by industry body Assocham.\n\nOn March 2, poultry breeders demanded a relief package from the government claiming that the sector has incurred heavy losses of around Rs 1,750 crore in a month due to fake news that eating chicken could spread coronavirus.\n\nPoultry bird prices have plunged to Rs 10-30 per kg at farm gate level due to a slump in chicken demand while the average cost of production is Rs 80 per kg, the All India Poultry Breeders Association had said in a representation to the Ministry of Animal Husbandry.",

    "vclaim": "There is no scientific evidence that coronavirus spreads through consumption of chicken, mutton, and seafood according to FSSAI chief G S G Ayyangar. The coronavirus will not survive in temperatures above 35-36 degrees celsius according to FSSAI. The poultry industry has suffered losses of approximately Rs 1,750 crore in one month due to fake news about chicken consumption spreading coronavirus. India has successfully handled viruses like Ebola and Avian flu in the past, suggesting it's just a matter of time before a coronavirus vaccine is developed.",
