Medium-Risk. Alert\" by Scam Detector, a major fraud prevention resource.\n\nThe claims were earlier viral in the context of the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Telangana, and have resurfaced now in the context of the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nIf you would like us to fact-check a claim, give feedback or lodge a complaint, WhatsApp us at 9999499044 or email us at checkthis@newschecker.in.
