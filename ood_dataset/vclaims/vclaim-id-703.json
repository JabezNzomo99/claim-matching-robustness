    "full_text": "Explosive new video has captured the moment Houthi terrorists planted bombs on a hijacked Greek oil tanker before dramatically setting them off last week \u2014 sparking fears of a massive oil spill in the Red Sea.\n\nThe fiery footage, released by Yemen's Houthi rebels on Thursday, showed several armed and masked terrorists storming aboard the abandoned 900-foot Sounion vessel soon after they launched their assault back on Aug. 21.\n\nIn the clip, fighters carrying Kalashnikov-style rifles can be seen stalking the decks of the ransacked ship before rigging multiple explosives over hatches leading to the oil tankers below.\n\nThe video then cuts to the moment at least six simultaneous blasts are set off on the ship as rebels scream \"Allahu Akbar\" in the background.\n\nThe terrorists could also be heard chanting their motto as the bombs detonated: \"God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.\"\n\nThe tanker, which is laden with about one million barrels of oil, was quickly abandoned when the Iran-backed rebels first started attacking it with small arms fire, projectiles and a drone boat last week.\n\nA French destroyer quickly rescued the Sounion's crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, in the wake of the attacks.\n\nTwo days later, the Houthi terrorists detonated the explosives and the vessel has been ablaze in the middle of the sea ever since.\n\nThe Iran-aligned Houthis \u2014 who are officially designated by the US as being terrorists \u2014 said Wednesday they would finally allow salvage crews to tow the ship to safety after multiple countries voiced humanitarian and environmental concerns over potential oil spillages.\n\nNo oil spill had been detected though as of Thursday, according to the European Unions' naval force in the region.\n\nThe force, known as Operation Aspides, \"is preparing to facilitate any courses of action, in coordination with European authorities and neighboring countries, to avert a catastrophic environmental crisis,\" the EU mission said.\n\n\"Together, we can protect the environment and maintain stability in the region.\"",
