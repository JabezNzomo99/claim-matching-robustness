    "full_text": "After post on Raksha Bandhan sparks heated debate online, Sudha Murty clarifies\n\nNEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP Sudha Murthy found herself at the receiving end of public flak after tracing the roots of Raksha Bandhan to Mughal emperor Humayun. In a video posted on X, the Philanthropist wished people on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan and drew parallels to the origins of the festival to \"Rani Karnavati sending a thread to Humayun\" when she was in danger in the 16th century.\n\n\"Raksha Bandhan has a rich history. When Rani Karnavati was in danger, she sent a thread to King Humayun as a symbol of sibling-hood, asking for his help. This is where the tradition of the thread began and it continues to this day,\" the wife of the Infosys founder captioned her post featuring the video.\n\n\"Raksha Bandhan or Rakhi is one of the important festivals according to me where a sister ties a thread, it need not be a huge one, a thread is fine, indicating that in case of my difficulty, you should always be there to help me. Siblings are so important in life. It goes back, Rani Karnavati was in danger. Her kingdom was small. It was attacked by somebody else. She did not know what to do. She sent a small piece of thread to King Humayun, a Mughal emperor, saying that I am in danger. Please consider me as your sister, and please do come and protect me. Humayun did not know what it is because he came from different country,\" the Rajya Sabha MP said in the video.\n\nHowever, the wife of Infosys founder was not spared by those deeming her version of the story insensitive, eventually forcing the billionaire to clarify her stance. After facing heat from public, Sudha Murthy wrote another post to clear the air on the matter. She argued that the story she had narrated was one of many tales associated with the festival, certainly not its origin, and clarified that it was brought out with the intention of recalling the \"symbolism\" behind the age-old festival.\n\n\"The story I shared on Raksha Bandhan is just one of many tales associated with the festival and certainly not its origin. As I have said in the video clip, this was already a custom of the land,\" she said.\n\nPublic reaction:\nA user irked by her narration of the story said, \"You alienated the left with ur spoon remark and now the right also with this uncalled for 'tale' on Raksha Bandhan.\n\nAnother user sarcastically wrote, \"Thank you for bringing the Mughal Connection Ma'am...every Hindu festival we will be eagerly waiting to hear such stories about the origins of our festivals. Mughal-e-Rakshabandhan mam\"\n\nOne user wrote, while there is respect for her storytelling, \"I believe it's crucial to honor the diverse and ancient origins of Raksha Bandhan. Linking it to a Mughal emperor may overlook the broader cultural significance. Let's celebrate this beautiful tradition in a way that embraces all its richness.\"\n\nReacting to the video, a user commented, \"At this moment I know u know nothing about Indian festivals and culture if u believe in this nonsense story. I'm sorry to have recommended ur books for kids. They don't need to learn this manufactured story. Please read about Draupadi's Raksha Sutra for Srikrishna and the significance of Shravan Poornima.\"",
