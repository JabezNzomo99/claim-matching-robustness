Meanwhile, a newscard featuring a photo of CJI DY Chandrachud and his wife is circulating on social media with the allegation that his wife, Kalpana Das, is the niece of Dr. S.P.

Exploiting freedom of speech to indulge in wild falsehood, that too against the Hon'ble Apex Court, is illegal and punishable.\"\n\n2. The Supreme Court Registry also clarified the claim as \"Factually incorrect\", stating: \"A malicious tweet had been circulated on X ahead of the Supreme Court hearing on the Kolkata rape and murder case attempting to link a member of the family of the Chief Justice of India with a medical lobby in Bengal. The tweet is ill-intended, factually incorrect and an attempt to malign the judiciary.\"\n\nKalpana Das Background:\nAfter the passing away of his first wife Rashmi in 2007 due to cancer, CJI Chandrachud married Kalpana Das for the second time in 2008.
