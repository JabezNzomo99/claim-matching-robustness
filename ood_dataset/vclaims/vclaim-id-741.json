    "full_text": "Truth Behind Viral Hoax Warning Against Whatsapp Gold, 'Martinelli' & 'Dance Of The Pope' Videos\n\nClaim:\nWarning by BBC Radio against opening a link titled \"WhatsApp Gold\" or videos titled \"Martinelli\" & \"Dance of the Pope\"\n\nFact:\nHoax messages that are intended to be malware distribution tools\n\nA message, purportedly from BBC Radio, warning users against opening videos titled \"Martinelli\" and \"Dance of the Pope\" or opening links that promise an upgrade to \"Whatsapp Gold\" service, has gone viral on the messenger platform.\n\nThe viral \"warning\" states that these videos and links are intended to be malwares and urge users to forward the warning to others. Newschecker received this claim on our Whatsapp tipline (9999499044), too, requesting it to be fact-checked.\n\nFact Check:\nNewschecker noticed that the warning message had several grammatical errors, along with phrases like \"Fwd this msg to as many as you can\", which seemed unlike the language BBC Radio would use in a notice, raising our doubts.\n\nWe ran a keyword search for \"BBC Radio, Martinelli, Whatsapp Gold\", which did not show any relevant BBC report, but led us to a Forbes report, dated March 26, 2020, calling out the message as a hoax when it went viral back then.\n\nThe report stated that the viral message was meant to be a malware distribution tool \u2014 \"The more people pass the hoax upgrade message warning on to others, the more likely it is that the warning itself will include a link to real malware.\"\n\nA News18 report, dated March 27, 2020, stated that the Martinelli hoax WhatsApp message had first appeared back in 2016. \"Watch out for any WhatsApp invitation that wants you to upgrade to WhatsApp Gold. The way this worked is that if you accept the invite, you would then be asked to click a download link, which takes this as an invitation to install malware on their device.\"\n\nWe also came across a report by Malware bytes dated September 6, 2022, stating that the Martinelli-Whatsapp Gold-Pope dance hoax has been repackaged several times since at least 2017.\n\nUPDATE: We reached out to Whatsapp, where a spokesperson said, \"Both of these are false. WhatsApp Gold is a long-running hoax, as is Martinelli.\"\n\nConclusion:\nA viral Whatsapp message warning people against upgrading to Whatsapp Gold, clicking on videos titled \"Martinelli\" and \"Dance of the Pope\", was found to be an old hoax, intended to spread malware, dating back to 2016.\n\nResult: False",

    "title": "Fact: It is a recurring online scam message that has been reported by multiple media outlets. According to News18, the Martinelli hoax WhatsApp message, which first appeared back in 2016, has made a return. Watch out for any WhatsApp invitation that wants you to upgrade to WhatsApp Gold. The way this worked is that if you accept the invite, you would then be asked to click a download link, which takes this as an invitation to install malware on their device. Of course, you wouldn\u2019t immediately realize that malware is being installed on your phone. And no, there has never been a special WhatsApp Gold edition and it is unlikely there will ever be one.",
