That too, at the recommendation of the apex court of the country.\n\nMany on social media are claiming that once it is formed, \"No matter which Government is ruling, without the approval of this Organisation, no free electricity, free water, free distribution, or loan waivers can be announced by any government implement them[sic]. As the Money belongs to our tax payments, so the taxpayers should have the right to oversee its use.\"\n\nAFWA's investigation found that while it's true that the Supreme Court recently recommended a committee comprising several stakeholders that would look into the matters related to freebies announced by political parties during elections, however, the apex court is yet to mention the powers and limitations of such a committee.\n\nIs there such an organisation?\n\nWhile investigating the claim, we found a PTI report from August 3. It stated, following a PIL that challenged the practice of political parties promising freebies during elections, a Supreme Court bench suggested a committee comprising different stakeholders that would suggest measures to tackle the issue.\n\nWe then searched on the Supreme Court website to find out what the bench has actually ordered.\n\nThe order dated August 3 quotes: \"Keeping in mind the prayers made in these petitions which relate to distribution of freebies by political parties, we are of the considered view that it would be appropriate to constitute an Expert Body with representatives of all the stakeholders: the beneficiaries, those opposing freebies, Central Government, State Governments, opposition parties, Finance Commission, Reserve Bank of India, Niti Ayog etc., to name a few, to take a holistic and comprehensive view of the matter and making their recommendations.\"\n\nThe apex court further ordered that all stakeholders mentioned in the order and veteran advocate Kapil Sibal put their recommendations on the composition of the committee within a week. The National Herald published a piece on this order, talking to various Supreme Court advocates.\n\nSanjay Hegde was quoted saying, \"There is only a committee that is being formed. No report has come yet. The issue of jurisdiction will arise only if the apex court decides to act on the recommendations of the committee. As of now, it seems like it will be a burial by committee.\"\n\nNo reports also mention this committee either being called or referring to an all-India organisation of taxpayers. Hence, we can conclude that this claim is misleading. Although the Supreme Court has recommended a committee that will advise on issues related to election freebies, it has not yet been mentioned that election freebies can't be implemented without the approval of such a committee.",
