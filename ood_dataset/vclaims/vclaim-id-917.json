No, False Claim Viral Post Train Mishap\n\nClaim:\nStation Master Sharif is on a run since the tragic three-way train accident near Bahanaga Bazar railway station in Odisha's Balasore.\n\nFact:\nNo staff or station master named Sharif is posted at the Bahanaga Bazar railway station. South Eastern Railway CPRO confirmed that no staff has been absconding, and everyone is cooperating in the ongoing investigation into the cause of the accident.\n\nBackground:\nA multi-train collision near Bahanaga Bazar railway station in Odisha's Balasore district last week killed at least 278 people and left over 1000 injured. While the CBI has taken over the probe, several social media users claimed \"station master Sharif, who was responsible & posted where the Koramondal (Coromandel) Express collided, is missing.\" Users sharing the post further alleged \"Intelligence agencies suspect Bangladeshi & Rohingya angles plus ISI and Manipur.\"\n\nFact Check/Verification:\nA keyword search revealed that the actual station master at Bahanaga Bazar station is SB Mohanty. Multiple sources, including Odisha Bhaskar and India Today, confirmed that SB Mohanty was the station master on duty during the accident.\n\nSouth Eastern Railway's Chief Public Relations Officer Aditya Kumar Chaudhary explicitly stated that no staff has absconded. He confirmed, \"No staff or station master named Sharif is posted at the Bahanaga Bazar railway station. None of the staff is absconding from duty. They are part of the investigation. They are all cooperating in the investigation.\"\n\nRailway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had previously stated that the accident \"happened due to a change in electronic interlocking.\" The investigation is ongoing, and there is no evidence supporting claims of sabotage.\n\nConclusion:\nViral post claiming that a station master named Sharif has been absconding since the multi-train collision in Odisha's Balasore is false.\n\nResult: False",
