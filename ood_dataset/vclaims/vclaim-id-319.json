    "full_text": "I apologize, but the provided HTML content appears to be a complex web application template with multiple form elements, modals, and structural divs, but lacks any actual fact-check article content. The HTML seems to be primarily a framework for a web service or portal, with placeholder elements and script references.\n\nWithout an actual fact-check article's HTML content, I cannot extract the text as requested. If you have the specific fact-check HTML you'd like processed, please provide that, and I'll be happy to help you extract the full textual content following the guidelines you specified.\n\nTo successfully process a fact-check article, I would need HTML that contains:\n- A headline/title\n- The specific claim being fact-checked\n- The detailed fact-check analysis\n- Evidence and citations\n- Conclusion/rating\n\nWould you like to share the actual fact-check HTML content?",
