    "full_text": "PAN card-Aadhaar linking: Why it is mandatory; what happens if you don't\n\nThe Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has asked all taxpayers to link their permanent account number (PAN) with their Aadhaar by March 31, 2023. Any non-compliance will mean that the PAN will become inoperative from April 1, 2023.\n\nUPDATE: On March 28, the government extended the deadline for linking PAN and Aadhaar by three months to June 30, 2023.\n\nCapital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) too on Wednesday directed investors to link their PAN with their Aadhaar by the end of this month to continue doing transactions in the securities market.\n\nWhat is the rationale behind linking PAN with Aadhaar?\n\nThe Income-tax Department announced the linking of PAN with Aadhaar after it came across instances where multiple permanent account numbers (PANs) were allotted to one person, or where one PAN was allotted to more than one person.\n\nTo have a robust way of de-duplication of the PAN database, it was made mandatory for a taxpayer who is eligible to obtain Aadhaar, to quote his Aadhaar in the application form for PAN and return of income.\n\nWho needs to link PAN with Aadhaar?\n\nAs per a circular issued by CBDT in March 2022, the Income-tax Act makes it mandatory for every person who has been allotted a PAN as on July 1, 2017, to intimate his/her Aadhaar number so that Aadhaar and PAN can be linked. This is required to be done on or before March 31, 2023, failing which the PAN shall become inoperative.\n\nWho is not required to link PAN with Aadhaar?\n\nThere are a few categories of individuals for whom this linkage is not compulsory:\n* Any person of age 80 years and above\n* A non-resident as per the Income-tax Act\n* A person who is not a citizen of India\n\nWhat will happen if PAN is not linked with Aadhaar?\n\nCBDT has said that in case a person fails to link his or her PAN with Aadhaar, the PAN will become inoperative. Some major implications are:\n* The person shall not be able to file the income tax return using the inoperative PAN\n* Pending returns will not be processed\n* Pending refunds cannot be issued to inoperative PANs\n* Pending proceedings as in the case of defective returns cannot be completed\n* Tax will be required to be deducted at a higher rate if PAN becomes inoperative\n\nBesides these consequences, the person may find difficulties in doing other financial transactions such as with banks, as PAN is an important KYC criterion for these transactions.\n\nWhy has SEBI made it mandatory for investors to link PAN with Aadhaar?\n\nSince PAN is the key identification number and part of KYC requirements for all transactions in the securities market, all SEBI-registered entities and Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) are required to ensure valid KYC for all participants.\n\nAll existing investors are required to ensure the linking of their PAN with their Aadhaar before March 31, 2023, for continual and smooth transactions in the securities market.\n\nHow to link PAN with Aadhaar?\n\nOne can link PAN and Aadhaar by clicking on the Link Aadhaar option available on the official website of the Income-tax Department, http://www.incometax.gov.in.",

    "title": "Fact: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has asked all taxpayers to link their permanent account number (PAN) with their Aadhaar by March 31, 2023. Any non-compliance will mean that the PAN will become inoperative from April 1, 2023.\nSection 139AA of the Income Tax Act provides that every individual who has been allotted a permanent account number (PAN) as on the 1st day of July, 2017, and who is eligible to obtain an Aadhaar number, shall intimate his Aadhaar number in the prescribed form and manner. In other words, such persons have to mandatorily link their Aadhaar and PAN before the prescribed date (Presently, 31.03.2022 without fee payment and 31.03.2023 with prescribed fee payment).",
    "vclaim": "The Indian government requires taxpayers to link their PAN with Aadhaar by June 30, 2023, after extending the original March 31 deadline. The linking requirement was implemented because multiple PANs were being allotted to single individuals or single PANs to multiple persons. PAN-Aadhaar linking is mandatory for everyone with a PAN as of July 1, 2017, except for people aged 80 and above, non-residents, and non-Indian citizens. Failure to link PAN with Aadhaar will result in the PAN becoming inoperative, leading to inability to file tax returns, process refunds, and higher tax deductions. SEBI mandates PAN-Aadhaar linking for investors to continue transactions in the securities market as PAN is a key identification number for KYC requirements.",
