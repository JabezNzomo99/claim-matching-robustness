The content is just a thumbnail/preview section with a headline about RBI KYC rules, but lacks the actual substantive article text.\n\nTo extract the full content as you requested, I would need the complete HTML of the fact-check article. Could you please provide the full HTML content? I'm ready to process the entire article following the detailed guidelines you specified, which include:\n\n- Removing HTML tags\n- Preserving full text content\n- Maintaining original structure\n- Extracting core investigative narrative\n\nWithout the complete HTML, I cannot generate the processed text output you're seeking.",
