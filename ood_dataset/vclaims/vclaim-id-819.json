    "full_text": "A Doctors Alliance video is falsely shared as WHO Doctors taking a complete U-turn on COVID-19 pandemic\n\nA video of a panel of doctors is being shared widely with a description that they are WHO doctors who have taken a complete 'U-turn' on their stance on COVID-19 pandemic. The 4-minute video entails several unsubstantiated claims including COVID-19 being a normal flu and the coronavirus patients do not have to isolate or quarantine themselves, among others.\n\nClaim: WHO Doctors taking a U-turn on quarantine and social distancing norms during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFact: The speakers in the video are not WHO doctors. It is a group of doctors alliance who are spreading false news about the COVID-19 pandemic on how social distancing, quarantine, or isolation are not required to combat the spread of COVID-19. Thus, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe doctors in the video are not WHO doctors but are a part of World Doctor Alliance group. The first spokesperson identified as Dr. Elke De Klerk, General practitioner, claimed that 'we do not have a pandemic and COVID-19 is a normal flu virus'. However, the WHO has declared that the world is currently reeling under a pandemic. In fact, the CDC has clearly declared that it is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, not a strain of influenza.\n\nDr. Elke De Klerk continues to claim that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests have been giving false positive results in about 89-94% of the cases which is false. While the probability for false positives and negatives is a matter of concern, The Lancet Respiratory Medicine reassured that the margin of error for false positives is estimated in the range of 0.8 -4%, while the range for false negatives is 2-33% in the UK.\n\nProf. Dolores Cahill claimed that there have only been 98 COVID-19 related deaths in Ireland since April. However, according to WHO COVID-19 dashboard, 1922 people have died of COVID-19 in Ireland. Following her claims, Prof. Cahill has been asked to resign as Vice-Chair of the European Union scientific committee.\n\nThe rest of the video had other doctors claiming that the lockdowns have proven to be both futile and detrimental on economies. The entire panel discussion has been subsequently removed from YouTube for violating its terms of service.\n\nThe video description on WHO taking a complete U-turn is from another false viral video clip, taken out of context from a Press Conference on 08 June 2020. However, the World Health Organization has not said that social distancing, quarantine, or isolation is not needed to combat the spread of COVID-19. Current WHO guidelines maintain that COVID-19 is a contagious disease and all the necessary precautions including isolation or quarantine must be followed and treated accordingly.",

    "vclaim": "A video falsely claims that WHO doctors have taken a U-turn on COVID-19 pandemic measures, when it actually shows doctors from World Doctor Alliance making unsubstantiated claims.

Prof. Dolores Cahill incorrectly stated that only 98 COVID-19 deaths occurred in Ireland since April, while WHO data shows 1,922 deaths. The viral video misrepresents WHO's stance, as the organization continues to recommend social distancing, quarantine, and isolation measures to combat COVID-19.",
