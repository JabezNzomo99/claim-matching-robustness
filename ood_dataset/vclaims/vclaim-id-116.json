The message on the page indicates that the user is entitled to a gift voucher worth Ksh 7,000.\n\nThe giveaway targeting loyal customers, it adds, is to celebrate the firm's anniversary. It does not specify the nature of the anniversary.\n\nUsers are asked their age, their thoughts about Safaricom and if they would recommend it to their friends as part of the requirements to redeem the gifts.\n\nAfter taking the survey, a page shows users that they have won Ksh 7,000. To get the money, respondents are required to share the promotion information with five groups or 20 friends via WhatsApp.\n\nClicking on the green WhatsApp button directs to an app on the user's phone, inviting others to click on the link to redeem the giveaway. At this stage, the message informs the user they must complete the final process to receive the reward.\n\nThis sequence mirrors many phishing scams that are modelled as promotional giveaways aimed at mining personal information.\n\nScammers also use tactics similar to these to carry out click fraud \u2014 a common scheme that lures users to bogus websites with the promise of getting a reward.\n\nThose who fall prey to such clickbait are also urged to share them with more people, which ultimately brings revenues to the operators of the fake offers, advertisements, or campaigns.\n\nThere is no information about the giveaway on the legitimate Safaricom website or its Facebook and Twitter accounts.\n\nFurther, the fake website's domain name is safcomken.gifts, which is not the legitimate domain name of Safaricom's website \u2014 safaricom.co.ke.\n\nThe WHOIS information of the impostor website shows it was registered on 2 October 2021 in Iceland, days before the link surfaced online.\n\nOn the other hand, WHOIS data of the legitimate website of Safaricom shows it was registered on 12 February 2003 in Nairobi, Kenya. The registrant information indicates that the site is owned by Safaricom PLC, located along Waiyaki Way in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.\n\nResponding to a query by a user on Twitter, Safaricom disowned both the website and the promotional giveaway.\n\nPesaCheck has looked into the website impersonating Safaricom and offering giveaways in its name and finds it to be a HOAX.",

    "vclaim": "A fraudulent website using Safaricom's branding is offering fake Ksh 7,000 gift vouchers to users. The scam website requires users to share the promotion with others via WhatsApp to supposedly redeem their prize. The fake website uses the domain \"safcomken.gifts\" instead of Safaricom's legitimate domain \"safaricom.co.ke\" and was registered in Iceland, not Kenya. Safaricom has officially denied any connection to the website and its promotional giveaway on Twitter.",
