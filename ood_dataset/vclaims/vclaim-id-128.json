    "full_text": "Fact Check: Nagma goofs up again, calls anti-govt activist Vajpayee's niece\n\nCongress leader and former actress Nagma tweeted a video of a woman criticising the BJP government, claiming that she is the niece of late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. However, the woman in the video is not Vajpayee's niece Karuna Shukla, but social activist Atiya Alvi, who was talking about the Citizenship Amendment Act at Jantar Mantar in January this year.\n\nClaim:\nCongress leader and former actress Nagma tweeted a video of a woman criticising the BJP government, claiming that she is the niece of late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The 2-minute-20-second video was posted by Nagma from her Twitter handle \"@nagma_morarji\" on October 6. Text laid over the video in Hindi says, \"Honourable Atal Bihari Vajpayee's niece finally broke her silence\".\n\nNagma wrote a caption in Hindi which translates to, \"Atal ji's niece is saying that RSS and BJP have a dangerous agenda of dividing the country and they are pursuing it. They are destroying the unity and integrity of the country together with the godi media. They are not able to provide jobs to youth, solve farmers' issues or provide safety to women.\"\n\nFact:\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the woman in the video is not Vajpayee's niece Karuna Shukla, but social activist Atiya Alvi, who was talking about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Jantar Mantar in January this year.\n\nTracing the video:\nThe viral clip mentions \"HNP News\" as the source. Using keyword search, we found the original video on YouTube posted on January 3. This video is 14 minutes long. We came to know from the video posted by the news channel that the woman is Atiya Alvi, a social activist who was speaking about CAA from Jantar Mantar in January this year.\n\nVajpayee's niece Karuna is much older than the woman in the viral video. She left BJP and joined Congress in 2014. This was reported in mainstream news websites.\n\nConclusion:\nHence, it is clear that the claim made by Congress leader Nagma about another Congress leader is misleading. The woman seen in the clip is not former PM Vajpayee's niece Karuna Shukla, but social activist Atiya Alvi.",

    "vclaim": "Congress leader Nagma falsely claimed in a tweet that a woman criticizing the BJP government in a video was Atal Bihari Vajpayee's niece, when the woman was actually social activist Atiya Alvi. The woman in the video was speaking about the Citizenship Amendment Act at Jantar Mantar in January, not about BJP's agenda as suggested in Nagma's tweet. Vajpayee's actual niece, Karuna Shukla, is much older than the woman in the viral video and had left BJP to join Congress in 2014.",
