    "full_text": "HOAX: This UNICEF Foundation giveaway is a sham\n\nUNICEF Kenya has termed it as a scam.\n\nThis Facebook post claiming that the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is giving away KSh65,000 is a HOAX.\n\nA screenshot of an M-PESA message showing that the sharer of the post received KSh65,000 from the UNICEF Foundation is attached.\n\nInterested people are asked to follow a WhatsApp link to get the money. However, before receiving the money, one is asked to pay an activation fee of Ksh 1,299.\n\nOnce you click the WhatsApp link, it leads you to a WhatsApp number with the username \"UNICEF FUNDS STRATEGY\". The WhatsApp number uses the UNICEF innovation logo.\n\nA similar Facebook post bears a link that directs to a WhatsApp number registered under the username \"UNICEF FOUNDATION PROGRAM\" and uses a UNICEF logo on the profile photo but with some additional text on it. Above the UNICEF logo, the profile photo bears the words, \"Certified by the Government of Kenya\" while the writings below the logo read, \"Sponsored by: World Help\". The phone number is registered under the username \"Unicef Foundation Program\" on Truecaller.\n\nTo confirm the authenticity of the cash giveaway, PesaCheck visited UNICEF Kenya's official Facebook page, where the UN agency had termed the giveaway a scam.\n\n\"UNICEF Kenya is aware of a fake offer from 'UNICEF Foundation' circulating on social media and messaging platforms. The scam falsely promises funding to users,\" UNICEF Kenya notes.\n\nOne person commented on the UNICEF post that they were conned KSh1,000.\n\nThe agency adds that \"UNICEF ONLY WORKS directly with governments, donors and implementing partners. We DO NOT make payments directly to individuals. There is NO UNICEF Foundation in Kenya or elsewhere globally. Be aware that this funding promise is not a real UNICEF activity. Do not engage with the UNICEF Foundation on any social media platforms, share your personal details, or make any payment\".\n\nPesaCheck has previously fact-checked other UNICEF promotions and found them to be scams.\n\nUNICEF is a UN agency that works with over 190 countries to save children's lives, defend their rights, and help them fulfil their potential, from early childhood to adolescence.\n\nPesaCheck has looked into this Facebook post claiming that the UNICEF Foundation is giving away KSh65,000 and finds it to be a HOAX.",
