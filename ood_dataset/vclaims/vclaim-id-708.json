    "full_text": "CLAIM: A map shows that Poland has not been the target of any terror attacks, the lack of which is a result of the country's \"strict no-migrants policy.\"\n\nAP'S ASSESSMENT: False.\n\nTHE FACTS:\n\nThe map, created by the Center for Strategic and International Studies using the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database, only includes terror attacks from 2012 through 2015. While the database does not have records of any terror attacks in Poland during that period, it shows there have been 42 terror attacks in Poland from 1971 through 2020.\n\nContrary to the claims, Poland is not a country with a \"strict no-migrants policy.\" As a member of the European Union, Poland must adhere to freedom of movement rights, which allow EU citizens and their families to reside freely in member countries. In 2020, Poland:\n- Issued 14,386 temporary residence permits\n- Naturalized 7,501 people\n- Registered approximately 1.6 million Ukrainian refugees by late May 2023\n\nExperts emphasize that the map and claims misrepresent the relationship between migration and terrorism. Key points include:\n- Most terror attacks are carried out by \"domestic assailants\"\n- Immigrants are more likely to be victims of terrorism than perpetrators\n- Countries with larger populations naturally experience more attacks\n- There are numerous documented attacks targeting migrants themselves\n\nThe Global Terrorism Database includes over 150 attacks targeting refugees and asylum-seekers in Western Europe over the past decade, which experts note is likely an underestimate.\n\nExperts like Daniel Meierrieks and Richard McAlexander stress that migrants are often victims of terrorism, not perpetrators, and are typically least interested in jeopardizing their new opportunities by engaging in violent acts.\n\nThis fact-check is part of AP's ongoing efforts to address widely shared misinformation by providing factual context to misleading online content.",

    "title": "Fact:  The viral claim came from a screenshot of a map spread online alongside erroneous claims that it shows a link between Poland\u2019s migration policies and low levels of terrorism. It is true that CSIS\u2019 map does not show any terror attacks in Poland. However, it only shows attacks recorded in the Global Terrorism Database over a four-year period, from 2012 through 2015. The database has records of attacks from 1970 through 2020. During that time, Poland has seen 42 terror attacks, including six that occurred after 2015.",
    "vclaim": "A viral map claiming Poland has never experienced terror attacks due to its \"strict no-migrants policy\" is false as it only shows data from 2012-2015, while the country had 42 terror attacks between 1971-2020. The assertion that Poland has a \"strict no-migrants policy\" is false, as the country issues thousands of residence permits, has naturalized citizens, and has accepted millions of Ukrainian refugees. The alleged connection between migration and terrorism is misleading since most terror attacks are conducted by domestic assailants, and migrants are more likely to be victims rather than perpetrators of terrorism.",
