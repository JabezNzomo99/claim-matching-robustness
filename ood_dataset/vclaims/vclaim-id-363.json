    "full_text": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nHow Do I Choose Which COVID-19 Vaccine To Take?\nAll authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective and available free of charge. The Ministry of Health does not recommend one vaccine type over another.\n\nHow Do COVID-19 Vaccines Work?\nThe vaccines prepare your immune system to recognize and fight off the virus that causes COVID-19. The vaccines are designed to teach the body's immune system to safely recognize and block the virus that causes COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccine uses a form of the virus that has been inactivated or weakened so it doesn't cause disease but still generates an immune response.\n\nHow Can I Get A Covid-19 Certificate If I Got The Jab Outside The Country?\nYou can only get your certificate from where you got vaccinated. This is because it contains personal details as well as details of vaccine administered.\n\nWhat Causes Preterm Birth And What Is Kenya Doing To Address The Problem?\nPreterm is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed. Kenya has adopted low-cost interventions that have been shown to be effective in improving preterm survival. They include steroid injections, Kangaroo Mother Care as well as use of Chlorhexidine digluconate 7.1% w/v gel for immediate care of the umbilical cord to prevent sepsis.\n\nWhat Are The Signs And Symptoms Of Pneumonia And What Are Some Of The Available Intervention And Prevention Mechanisms?\nPneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs and is one of the leading causes of child mortality.\n\nIt is caused by a number of infectious agents including viruses, bacteria and fungi. Good personal and food preparation hygiene, exclusive breastfeeding and adequate nutrition for children are among the most cost-effective interventions that contribute to reduced pneumonia incidence. However, completing the immunization schedule is the most effective way of preventing pneumonia.",

COVID-19 vaccination certificates can only be obtained from the location where the vaccination was administered. Kenya has implemented low-cost interventions including steroid injections, Kangaroo Mother Care, and Chlorhexidine gel to improve preterm baby survival.
