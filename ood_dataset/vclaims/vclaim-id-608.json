    "full_text": "Bangladesh protests: 39 killed, protesters set state broadcaster's building ablaze\n\nViolent clashes between student protesters and security officials over a quota system for government jobs led to 39 deaths so far across Bangladesh.\n\nWidespread violence gripped Bangladesh after relentless clashes between student protesters, security officials, and pro-government student activists over a quota system for government jobs. At least 39 people died in the violence, with Thursday becoming the most violent day.\n\nPolice and protesters armed with sticks and rocks clashed across the country, including in the capital, Dhaka, as the students tried to shut down transportation across Bangladesh. Hundreds of people were injured as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to break up groups of protesters, who torched vehicles, police posts and other establishments.\n\nStreets looked deserted in Bangladesh's Dhaka on Friday following the violent protests on Thursday. Bangladesh TV news channels are not transmitting on Friday, news agency Reuters reported.\n\nCommunication services were widely disrupted in Bangladesh on Friday, with authorities cutting some mobile services on Thursday to try to quell the unrest but the disruption spread across the country. According to outage monitor NetBlocks, Bangladesh was plunged into a \"near-total\" internet shutdown as night fell. Telephone calls from overseas were mostly not getting connected and calls through the internet could not be completed.\n\nOn Thursday, the student protestors set fire to the state broadcaster's building a day after the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, appeared on the network seeking to calm the clashes. Several police posts, vehicles and other establishments were also torched. Multiple Awami League officers were also attacked by the students.\n\nThe protesters are demanding that the Sheikh Hasina government stop setting aside 30 per cent of government jobs for the families of people who fought in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. The agitation, fueled by high unemployment, is the biggest since Prime Minister Hasina was reelected earlier this year.\n\nThe protests began late last month. However, it escalated on Monday when student activists at Dhaka University clashed with police and counter-protesters backed by the ruling Awami League.\n\nThe protesters argue that the quota system is framed to benefit the supporters of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, which led the independence movement. They call it a discriminatory system and want to replace it with a merit-based system. Though the Bangladesh government scrapped these quotas in 2018, a High Court reinstated them later.\n\nThe Bangladesh Supreme Court, on August 7, is set to hear the government's appeal against the High Court's order reinstating the quota, which was abolished by the government in 2018.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meanwhile, appealed for peace and assured the students that they will not be disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision. During her address to the nation, she also declared that judicial inquiries would be conducted and the perpetrators would be brought to justice.\n\nThe ruling Awami League alleged that the protest turned violent after Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, and another organisation, Chhatra Dal, infiltrated it. The League said in a statement that security forces were deployed to maintain law and order.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for restraint by all sides and urged the authorities to investigate all acts of violence and hold the perpetrators to account. \"The secretary-general encourages the meaningful and constructive participation of youth to address the ongoing challenges in Bangladesh. Violence can never be the solution,\" said UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.",

    "vclaim": "Violent protests in Bangladesh over a government job quota system have resulted in 39 deaths and widespread destruction, including the burning of the state broadcaster's building. The protests are against a 30% quota system in government jobs reserved for families of independence war veterans, with protesters demanding a merit-based system instead. The violence led to a near-total internet shutdown in Bangladesh, with disrupted communication services and extensive damage to public property. The ruling Awami League claims the protests turned violent due to infiltration by student wings of opposition groups Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and Chhatra Dal. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appealed for peace and promised judicial inquiries, while the Supreme Court is set to hear an appeal regarding the quota system on August 7.",
