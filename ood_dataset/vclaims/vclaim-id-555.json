    "full_text": "Old Video of Delhi Minister Atishi 'Cancelling' Power Subsidy Viral as Recent\n\nThe video is not recent as claimed, and dates back to a press conference held by Atishi on 14 April 2023.\n\nA video of Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi's Power Minister, Atishi Marlena, announcing the 'termination' of the free electricity subsidy scheme in New Delhi is going viral on social media.\n\nIn the video, the minister can be heard saying that tomorrow onwards, the subsidy scheme will not be applied to \"new electricity bills, starting tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat are the users sayings?: The video is being shared to claim that the statement was made recently, amid the ongoing 2024 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThose sharing the video are asking people to vote carefully.\n\nWhat is the truth?: This video has been clipped from a press conference held on 14 April 2023, and is not related to the 2024 general elections.\n\nIn 2023, Atishi spoke about the electricity subsidy being stopped in Delhi, due to a tiff between the state's AAP government and the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi VK Saxena.\n\nHow did we find out the truth?: Team WebQoof had published a fact-check on the same clipped video in 2023, when it was being shared with misleading context.\n\nWe ran a reverse image search using Google, which led us to a X (formerly Twitter) by news agency ANI, carrying updates from an AAP press conference.\n\nThe thread carried the same visuals, and was shared on 14 April 2023.\n\nThe subsidy issue: In the conference, Atishi called out LG Saxena's office for holding up files related to the subsidy scheme.\n\nShe said that funds for the scheme could not be release without clearance from the LG's end, and that she was unable to set an appointment with him.\n\nAfter this press conference, the LG's office dismissed her statements, claiming they were misleading and false.\n\nLater that day, the free electricity subsidy scheme was extended for the year 2023-24, with LG Saxena's approval.\n\nConclusion: The video dates back to April 2023 and is not related to the ongoing general elections.",

    "vclaim": "A video of Delhi Power Minister Atishi announcing the termination of free electricity subsidy is being falsely shared as recent during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The viral video is actually from a press conference held on April 14, 2023, where Atishi discussed subsidy issues due to a conflict with Delhi's Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena. The electricity subsidy scheme was eventually extended for 2023-24 with LG Saxena's approval on the same day as the press conference.",
