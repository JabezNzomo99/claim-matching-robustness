In which, every person should keep their mobile phones away because cosmic rays will pass near Earth at midnight. This viral message is being heavily shared on WhatsApp groups and Facebook groups.\n\nFacebook users are sharing a message stating: \"Dear members, today from 12:30 PM to 3:30 AM, ensure your cellular phones, tablets etc. are switched off and kept away from your body. CNN Television has provided this information. Please inform your family and friends. Tonight from 12:30 to 3:30, because our planet will emit many radiation emissions. Cosmic rays will pass near Earth. So please switch off your mobiles. Do not leave your devices near your body, as it can cause serious damage. Check Google, NASA and BBC news. Send this message to all important people in your life. You will save millions of lives.\"\n\nFact Check / Verification:\n\nSearching Google keywords about the viral message claiming cosmic rays will pass near Earth at midnight revealed that this viral message has been spreading on the internet since 2008. In 2010, a similar message was viral under BBC News name in Ghana, claiming cosmic rays would fall on Earth between 12:30 and 3:30 PM.\n\nRegarding this viral message, BBC clarified that they have not issued any warning or message. It was clearly stated that this is merely a rumor and the claim in the message is completely false.\n\nMoreover, no information related to this viral message was found in any news released by NASA. However, NASA has provided information about cosmic rays on their website. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles like protons and electrons that pass through the galaxy at the speed of light and reach our solar system.\n\nWhat are Cosmic Rays?\n\nAccording to NASA's website, when cosmic rays were first discovered, scientists mistakenly thought they were rays like sunlight. Cosmic rays are actually small particles emitted by supernova explosion events on distant and ancient stars.\n\nAdditionally, NASA has developed a website that updates photos of cosmic rays observed in Minnesota, USA every 15 seconds. Organizations like NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) continuously provide warnings about cosmic rays.\n\nCosmic rays are not a direct threat to life on Earth. The information on this website indicates that keeping mobile phones or electronic devices nearby does not increase risk. The magnetic field and atmosphere around any planet protect life from the complete effects of solar and cosmic radiation.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe claim that cosmic rays will pass near Earth at midnight is completely misleading. No message has been issued by NASA or Google to protect from or be cautious about cosmic radiation.\n\nResult: False\n\nOur Sources:\nOfficial Website of NASA\nOfficial Website of NOAA\nGoogle Research",

    "vclaim": "A viral social media message claims cosmic rays will pass near Earth at midnight, requiring people to switch off and keep away their mobile phones. The message falsely attributes warnings about cosmic radiation to CNN, NASA, BBC, and Google, claiming these rays could cause serious damage to people through their electronic devices. The viral message has been debunked as a hoax that has been circulating since 2008, with no such warnings ever being issued by NASA, BBC, or other cited organizations. According to NASA, cosmic rays are actually high-energy particles from distant stars that pose no direct threat to life on Earth due to the planet's magnetic field and atmosphere.",
