    "full_text": "How to Spot a Job Scam: A Case Study of Mara Resort and Aero Cargo Job Hoaxes\n\nDesperate to make ends meet, many unsuspecting job seekers are becoming victims of scam traps. For the past one and a half years, job seekers in the hotel and cargo sectors in Kenya have fallen prey to scammers who purposely target these sectors by purporting to offer opportunities.\n\nThese con artists exploit the fact that in Africa, the growth rate of available job opportunities is much slower compared to population growth. The scammers use various tricks such as creating job advertisements on websites, signing purported appointment letters, or inviting \"appointees\" to report for work.\n\nPesaCheck has, since 2021, debunked 10 fake jobs, with many using \"Mara\" as their location at the Maasai Mara National Reserve or \"Cargo\" to legitimize their companies.\n\nHere are 10 ways to spot a job scam:\n\n1. Social Media Presence\nCheck the organization's Facebook page transparency. Look for suspicious name changes or recently created pages.\n\n2. Website Verification\nExamine the organization's website. Be wary of sites that are:\n- Always under maintenance\n- Have broken links\n- Show inconsistent information\n- Use images lifted from other websites\n\n3. Beware of Fee Requests\nLegitimate employers do not ask you to pay for:\n- Food handling certificates\n- Cargo handling certificates\n- Any other pre-employment fees\n\n4. Company Existence\nVerify the company's existence by:\n- Checking Google Maps street view\n- Searching business registration websites\n- Contacting local county government offices\n\n5. Phone Number Verification\nScammers often reuse phone numbers across multiple fake job advertisements. Check the number's Truecaller details and compare them with the job advert.\n\n6. No Interviews\nBe suspicious of job offers that:\n- Guarantee employment for everyone\n- Promise automatic salary increases\n- Do not conduct interviews\n\n7. Appointment Letter Scrutiny\nCheck for:\n- Repeated letter templates\n- Similar formatting across different job scams\n- Consistent logo and design elements\n\n8. Social Media Reviews\nSearch for public comments about the job or company on social platforms.\n\n9. Fact-Checking\nSearch online to see if the job has been previously debunked by fact-checking organizations.\n\n10. Submit for Verification\nIf unsure, submit the job advert to fact-checking organizations like PesaCheck for verification.\n\nKey Takeaway: If a job looks too good to be true, it probably is a hoax. Always thoroughly research and verify job opportunities before applying or paying any fees.",

    "title": "Hi, thank you for contacting PesaCheck.\n\nAfter evaluating the Mara Bistro Game Resorts appointment letter, we have noticed several red flags:\n1. One of the contacts is registered under \"Mara Resorts\" which is a resort we debunked and found to be a scam as seen here: https://bit.ly/46TSqwT\n2. The wording of the letter reads exactly the same as the letters used in other job scams we have fact-checked.\n\nIf you are being asked to pay for a food handling certificate, that could be another red flag.\n\nHere is a long-form article we did. Go through it to see whether there are other red flags in this particular job:",
