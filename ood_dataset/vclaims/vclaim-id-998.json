    "full_text": "Hot Pineapple Water Will Not Cure Cancer, Viral Claim Is False\n\nWhile the scientific community continues to research the cure for cancer, a viral social media post claims to have found a cure that has \"defeated cancer\" - hot pineapple water. According to the viral message circulating in WhatsApp groups, adding a few slices of chopped pineapple to hot water and drinking this mixture can help boost the body's ability to fight the disease. Newschecker has found the claim to be false.\n\nThe claim had earlier gone viral in 2021 on social media, with several users sharing the post as genuine.\n\nNewschecker received this claim on their WhatsApp tipline requesting it to be fact checked.\n\nQuoting one Dr Gilbert A Kwok, a professor of ICBS general hospital, the viral message says that \"Warm pineapple releases anticancer substances, the latest advances in medicine for effective cancer treatment.\"\n\n\"The hot pineapple fruit has the effect of killing cysts and tumours. Proven to repair all types of cancer. Hot pineapple water can kill all germs and toxins from the body as a result of allergies. The type of medicine with pineapple extract only destroys violent cells, it does not affect healthy cells. In addition, amino acids and pineapple polyphenols in pineapple juice can regulate high blood pressure, effectively preventing the blockage of inner blood vessels, adjusting blood circulation and reducing blood clots,\" it further adds.\n\nFact check/Verification:\n\nTo begin with, Newschecker looked up Dr Gilbert A Kwok, who is purportedly a professor of ICBS general hospital. Despite extensive search, they did not find any leads with the name. They further looked up the keywords \"Hot Pineapple water\" on Facebook and found several posts that shared the same information. But these posts quoted one Dr Gilbert A Kwakeye instead of Kwok, and identified him as a doctor with the ICBS hospital.\n\nFurther research revealed no substantial evidence to support the claim that hot pineapple water can cure cancer. While a study from Taiwan showed that Bromelain, an enzyme found in pineapples, might inhibit cancer cell growth in laboratory settings, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre notes that there isn't enough evidence to claim Bromelain can significantly affect cancer in humans.\n\nAnother expert, Professor Dr Aru Wisaksono Sudoyo from the Indonesian Cancer Foundation, stated that while pineapples are healthy and can support general health and immunity, they are not equivalent to medical treatments or therapies for cancer.\n\nDr Jojo V Joseph, Sr Oncological Surgeon, further confirmed that the claim was absolutely baseless. He emphasized that pineapple is a good addition to one's diet but has no magical cancer-curing properties.\n\nConclusion:\nNewschecker's research revealed that the claim of hot pineapple water being used as a cure for cancer is misleading. While the enzyme in pineapple may inhibit cell growth in test-tube settings, it cannot be used as a cure for cancer.\n\nResult: False",
