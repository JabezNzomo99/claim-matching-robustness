    "full_text": "SCAM: This Trans-Gem Cargo Freights job is not authentic\n\nThe company advertising for positions does not exist and the recruitment process is consistent with scammers' tactics.\n\nA job advert posted on a website dubbed Trans-Gem Cargo Freights claiming to recruit 94 staff members is a SCAM. The advert purports to advertise positions for 54 cargo handlers and packaging staff, 26 dispatch assistants, and 14 stock takers.\n\nThe job qualifications include being a Kenyan citizen with an O-level education or holding a Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE). The applicant needs to be aged between 18\u201335 years and be able to work under pressure for long and odd hours. Other needed qualities include punctuality, honesty and integrity, excellent interpersonal and teamwork skills.\n\nApplicants are required to submit documents such as an application letter indicating their preferred position and shift and an up-to-date curriculum vitae. Other documents needed include a copy of Identification Card or waiting card and a KCSE certificate or result slip.\n\nThe job is a three-year contract with a KSh32,045 net salary, bound to be revised upwards after three months. Those who want to stay at staff hostels will pay a monthly rent of KShs 9500 (accommodation, breakfast & super) OR KShs 5000 (accommodation only) deducted from their monthly pay.\n\nHowever, the job advert has several red flags:\n\n1. No experience is required to get the job\n2. The appointment letter claims there are no interviews and applicants will only prove themselves during the job\n3. The name \"Hillary K. Kibiwott\" has been used in another job advert that was previously debunked as a scam\n4. The phone numbers are the same as those used in two other job scams\n5. The letterhead and language are similar to a previous scam offer letter\n\nAfter searching, it was discovered that:\n- Trans-Gem Cargo Freights does not exist at JKIA\n- The company is not registered on the Business Registration Service website\n- The company is not listed on Google Maps\n\nApplicants are urged to be cautious and avoid falling victim to this scam.",

The company cannot be found on official business registration services, at JKIA, or on Google Maps, confirming its non-existence.",
