There is no data to suggest that hot coconut water can provide cure to any type of cancer. Public are requested not to be misinformed by false and harmful messages sent on social media,\" read the notice.\n\nBadwe said that messaging apps have become a tool to disseminate incorrect information. \"It is uncontrolled and such messages have a big impact on the way people perceive medical treatment,\" he said.\n\nThis is not the first time that misinformation related to health and medicine has been spread. Earlier this year, unverified reports about complications and deaths related to the Measles-Rubella vaccination circulated on social media.\n\nDr Chandrashekar Chiplunkar, assistant health official, Brihamumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), had at the time told HT, \"There are messages which say syringes are being reused, but that is not possible as we use auto-disabled syringes.\"",
