    "full_text": "Can the Seismic Wave Card Containing Photos of the Recent Morocco Earthquake Hack Your Phone?!\n\nClaim: Morocco Earthquake Seismic Wave Card Can Hack Your Phone!\n\nThis warning about the Seismic Wave Card containing photos of the recent earthquake at Morocco has gone viral on WhatsApp:\n\n\"They are going to upload some photos of the Moroccan earthquake on WhatsApp. The file is called Seismic Waves CARD, don't open it and see it, it will hack your phone in 10 seconds and it cannot be stopped in any way. Share the information with your family and friends. DO NOT OPEN IT. They also said it on TV\"\n\nTruth: There Is No Morocco Earthquake Seismic Wave Card!\n\nFact #1: There Is No Seismic Wave Card!\nFirst, let me just point out that there is no such thing as a Seismic Wave Card. The Seismic Wave Card is an Internet hoax that keeps getting recycled for every earthquake that comes along.\n\nFact #2: Photos Are Shared Directly On WhatsApp\nThere is no need to open any file, or install any app, to view photos on WhatsApp. You simply click to view photos shared by other people on WhatsApp.\n\nFact #3: Seismic Waves Card Is Not A Browser Hijacker\nThere is no evidence that a malware or browser hijacker called Seismic Waves Card exists.\n\nFact #4: Image-Based Malware Is Possible, But\u2026\nDigital steganography is a method by which secret messages and other data can be hidden in digital files. It is possible to embed malicious code within a photo, but it won't be a full-fledged malware that can execute by itself.\n\nFact #5: Image-Based Malware Requires User Action\nEven sophisticated image-based malware requires user action. You cannot get infected by the Trojan if you practice good \"Internet hygiene\" by not downloading or installing anything from unknown websites.\n\nFact #6: Malicious Code Executes Immediately\nIf you accidentally download and trigger malware, it will execute immediately. It won't take 10 seconds, as the hoax message claims. There is really no reason for malware to wait before it infects your devices.\n\nThis is yet another example of FAKE NEWS circulating on WhatsApp. Do not spread or believe such unfounded claims.",

    "vclaim": "A viral WhatsApp message warns about a \"Seismic Wave Card\" containing Morocco earthquake photos that can allegedly hack phones in 10 seconds. The \"Seismic Wave Card\" is a hoax that gets recycled for different earthquakes, and no such malicious file exists. While image-based malware is technically possible through digital steganography, it requires user action to execute and wouldn't work as described in the viral message.",
