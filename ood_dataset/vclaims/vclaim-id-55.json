Over the past few months, PesaCheck has identified a number of scams offering jobs, loans, grants and giveaways, all using the names of prominent individuals, businesses and organizations on social media.\n\nA Buzzfeed article on scammers using Facebook to find new and unsuspecting victims in Kenya found that millions of Kenyans may have been exposed to fraud on the platform, and that the most likely target was the collection of information such as identity card and phone numbers that users are asked to share online. These scams trick users into thinking that they are interacting with legitimate entities online, and by the time they discover the fraud, it is often too late.\n\nScammers craft these fake offers and use them to prey on unsuspecting individuals, and they do this to steal a person's identity, defraud them of money, to increase clicks for monetary gain, or to steal personal information.\n\nThese scams mix some truth in with false information, and use this to manipulate legitimate content to increase their visibility and reach, making some hoaxes difficult to spot.\n\nSo, how can you avoid being conned? Here are some things to look out for:\n\n1. Poorly written posts\nMany scams are produced in a hurry and often contain spelling and grammatical mistakes. While errors may result from poor language skills, most mistakes are intentional and strategic. Organizations typically have social media teams that carefully craft messages, so such errors would not pass internal scrutiny.\n\n2. Posts that ask users to share content with friends to win\nSome posts claim to offer gift cards or shopping vouchers and require users to share the post with friends to enter. Clicking the link often redirects to a site requesting personal information or payment via mobile money to process the winnings.\n\n3. Posts that ask for money to facilitate a process\nScams directly asking for money are common in job and loan advertisements. Applicants are asked to pay a processing, application, or registration fee. Payment is usually requested through mobile money transfer to a personal number, not an official company account.\n\n4. Posts that direct to an unrelated website\nSome scams use a real company's name, creating social media pages or websites that look official. They often use Google forms to collect personal information or create basic websites mimicking brand colors.\n\n5. Promotions on recently created pages or websites\nCheck when a page was set up and review its post history. Legitimate brand pages have multiple posts, while scam pages are often created recently and focus solely on giveaways.\n\nThe golden rule is: if something doesn't sound right, it probably isn't. Always verify information, check official websites, and be cautious of offers that seem too good to be true.",
