    "full_text": "There's No Article 30(A) That Says Gita Can't Be Taught in Schools\n\nCLAIM\nA viral message on social media claims that under Article 30 of the Indian Constitution, Quran, which is the religious text of Islam, can be taught in madrasas, while, allegedly under Article 30(A), Bhagavad Gita, Sanskrit scripture which is a part of Mahabharata, cannot be read in schools.\n\nSeveral social media users have shared the claim on Twitter and Facebook. Twitter user Vinita Rajpoot had shared the message, and was retweeted over 1,500 times and liked by 2,800 people till the time the article was written.\n\nTRUE OR FALSE?\nThe claim that under the constitution, Quran can be taught in madrasas but Bhagavad Gita cannot be read in schools is absolutely false.\n\nFirstly, there is no Article 30(A). The sub clause to Article 30 is Article 30(1A).\n\nSecondly, The Quint got in touch with former Secretary General of Lok Sabha Subhash Kashyap who said that there is no provision in the Indian constitution that suggests that Quran can be taught in madrasas and Bhagavad Gita cannot be read in schools.\n\nWhat Does Article 30 Say?\nArticle 30 of the Indian Constitution gives the right to minority groups, based on religion and language, to establish and administer educational institutions. Article 30(1A) deals with the fixed amount for acquisition of property of any educational institution established by minority groups.\n\nArticle 30(2) of the article states that government should not discriminate in giving aid to these educational institutions only because they are administered by minority groups, be it on the basis on any religion or language.\n\nSpeaking to The Quint, Kashyap said that there is no provision under Article 30 that talks about teaching Quran or not teaching Gita. He said:\n\n\"Under Article 30, minority groups can administer and establish educational institutions. Further, they can choose the medium of instruction to be used in the school. But the claim about Quran and Bhagavad Gita can taught or read in schools or not has got nothing to do with Article 30.\"\n\nSo, the claim about Article 30 is completely false and misleading.",

    "vclaim": "A viral social media message falsely claims that under Article 30 of the Indian Constitution, the Quran can be taught in madrasas while Article 30(A) prohibits teaching Bhagavad Gita in schools. There is no Article 30(A) in the Indian Constitution, only Article 30(1A) which deals with property acquisition of minority educational institutions. Article 30 only gives religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions, with no mention of religious texts that can or cannot be taught.",
