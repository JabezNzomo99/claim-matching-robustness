    "full_text": "IB Officer Ankit Sharma's Death: Inside Delhi Police Charge Sheet\n\nIn the charge sheet filed by Delhi police in the death of Intelligence Bureau official Ankit Sharma late last week, the police has asked for 'maximum exemplary punishment' for the accused 'to create sense of faith in rule of law in the mind of common citizens'.\n\nThe News of Ankit Sharma's Disappearance\n\nThe death of Ankit Sharma came to light while the northeast Delhi riots were still ravaging parts of the capital in February 2020. His father, Ravinder Kumar said that Ankit had stepped out of their home around 5:00 pm on 25 February evening but never returned. His father filed a missing person's report on 26 February, but a few hours later, around 12:00 noon, Ankit's body had been found in the drain at Chand Bagh.\n\nKumar said that Ankit had returned home and left the house on 25 February around 5:00 pm to get some things for the house, but never returned. His father went out looking for him, visited various hospitals in the locality, waited overnight, and reached the police station the next morning to file a missing persons report.\n\nEventually someone told him that some boys were killed in a mosque close to the Chand Bagh puliya and their bodies were dumped thereafter in the drains. With the help of authorities, Ankit's body was pulled out of the drain. He was rushed to GTB Hospital and declared brought dead. He had 51 injuries on his body.\n\nWitnesses on Ankit's Last Moments\n\nPiecing together what had happened, the Delhi police recorded statements of various public witnesses. The witnesses alleged that on 25 February Ankit had tried to mediate between two crowds. He moved ahead of the Hindus standing slightly away from suspended AAP councilor Tahir Hussain's home, in a bid to pacify people from both sides.\n\nHowever, the rioters, around 20-25 in number and holding stones, rods, lathis and knives, came from the side of Chand Bagh Pulia, caught hold of Ankit and pulled him in. This was allegedly at the instigation of Tahir Hussain from the front of his house and dragged him to Chand Bagh Pulia and beat him to death. His body was thrown in the drain near Chand Bagh Pulia at 5.39 pm, according to video footage seized by the police.\n\nAccused Identified in the Charge Sheet\n\nThe police identified five men accused of killing Ankit Sharma: Haseen alias Salman, Sameer Khan, Sabir, Nazim and Kasim. A large portion of the charge sheet focuses on the case against Haseen alias Salman, listing various pieces of evidence including intercepted calls, recovered weapons, and witness testimonies.\n\nOn the Involvement of Suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain\n\nTahir Hussain, arrested on 16 March 2020, has been implicated by the police as having led the mob and been instrumental in Ankit's death. The police alleged that Hussain provoked and instigated Muslims against Hindus, leading to violent riots. However, Hussain's lawyer has denied these allegations, stating there is no concrete evidence to support the police claims.\n\nThe article concludes with Ankit Sharma's brother Ankur's statement, requesting the central government to give his brother the status of a martyr and calling for the harshest punishment for the rioters who killed him.",
