    "full_text": "No FIR Against Aussie Cricketer Mitchell Marsh for 'Disrespecting' CWC Trophy\n\nAfter Australia won the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup on 19 November, a photo of Australian cricketer Mitchell Marsh, who had his feet propped up on the trophy, went viral on social media.\n\nIndian users expressed resentment towards Marshall and the photograph, calling it a 'disrespectful' gesture towards the cup.\n\nDays after this, several media organisations reported that a First Information Report (FIR) had been filed against the Australian cricketer in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh for his act.\n\nSeveral media organisations, including Free Press Journal, Sportskeeda, and Mint published reports about a FIR being filed against Marshall in Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh for \"offending the sentiments of Indian cricket team fans.\"\n\nRight-wing propaganda website OpIndia, which has been known to share misinformation, also published this on their page.\n\nBut: There is no FIR against Marshall at any police station under Aligarh Police, the police said in a statement.\n\nThe Quint contacted the complainant, who confirmed that he had filed a complaint \u2013 not a FIR \u2013 against Marshall and sent letters to the prime minister and the Sports Ministry.\n\nAll reports mentioned that the FIR was filed in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, and identified the complainant as one Pandit Keshav, who alleged that Marsh's action of putting his feet on the Cricket World Cup trophy had \"deeply offended the sentiments of Indian cricket team fans.\"\n\nAligarh Police's Superintendent (SP City) Mrigank Shekhar Pathak confirmed in a video statement that \"no FIR had been registered in any police station by Aligarh Police, nor any cognisance of any such complaint has been taken.\"\n\nThe complainant told The Quint that by putting his feet on something that Indians consider sacred [the trophy], Marsh has disrespected both religious and cultural sentiments of the nation. He stated that he would \"wait for them [the police] to proceed\", but would move the court if they did not. He posted two letters \u2013 one to the prime minister, the other to the Sports Ministry \u2013 demanding that Marsh be \"handed a lifetime ban from cricket,\" or, at least, never to be given an Indian visa.\n\nConclusion: The Aligarh Police has neither filed a FIR, nor registered a complaint against Australian cricketer Mitchell Marsh for keeping his feet on the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup Trophy.",
