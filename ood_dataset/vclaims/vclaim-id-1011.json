    "vclaim": "India suggests ending the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), claiming its role has been superseded by the 1972 Simla Agreement. Pakistan counters that no bilateral agreement has affected UNMOGIP's role or legality in monitoring the ceasefire. India argues that UNMOGIP's original purpose of supervising the 1949 ceasefire line is obsolete since a new Line of Control was established in 1971 and formalized in the 1972 Simla Agreement.",
