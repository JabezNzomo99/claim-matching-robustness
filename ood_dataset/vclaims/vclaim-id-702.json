In the authentic footage, Nehru is heard saying that Mr Jinnah was not involved in the freedom struggle.\n\nSeveral social media users, including verified handles, shared a black and white footage of Jawaharlal Nehru's interview claiming he admitted to not being involved in the Indian freedom struggle. Nehru is also heard talking about the Muslim League and the partition in the old video. However, Newschecker found that the video is not authentic and has been digitally manipulated.\n\nMultiple X, Facebook and Instagram users shared the 49-second-long video claiming, \"I was not involved in the fight for independence at all. In fact, opposed it\" \u2013 Nehru admitting to a foreign journalist.\n\nOn carefully analyzing the viral footage, we heard Nehru saying \"...in fact, he opposed it,\" and not \"I opposed it,\" as widely claimed. Further, the subtitles in this segment of the video incorrectly say \"you opposed it.\"\n\nIn the actual interview clip, Nehru is seen saying, \"Mr Jinnah was not involved in the fight for independence at all, in fact, he opposed it.\" He then goes on to discuss the Muslim League and partition, explaining that the Muslim League was started around 1911 by the British to create factions.\n\nWhen asked about his and Gandhi's stance on partition, Nehru responded that neither he nor Gandhi was in favor of it, but ultimately decided that partition was better than constant trouble.\n\nIt is clear that the word \"Mr Jinnah\" has been digitally replaced with \"I\" to falsely claim that Nehru said, \"I was not involved in the fight for independence at all.\"\n\nConclusion:\nThe viral footage claiming to show Jawaharlal Nehru saying that he was not involved in the fight for Indian Independence has been digitally edited.\n\nResult: Altered Video\n\nSources:\n- YouTube Video By Prasar Bharati Archives, Dated May 27, 2024\n- YouTube Video By Prasar Bharati Archives, Dated May 14, 2019",

    "vclaim": "A manipulated video falsely shows Jawaharlal Nehru admitting he was not involved in India's independence struggle, when in the original footage he was actually talking about Mr. Jinnah's non-involvement. In the authentic interview, Nehru discusses how neither he nor Gandhi favored partition but ultimately accepted it to avoid constant conflict. The viral video was digitally altered by replacing \"Mr Jinnah\" with \"I\" to create a false narrative about Nehru's role in the independence movement.",
