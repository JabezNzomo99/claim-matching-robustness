Here's The Truth Behind Viral WhatsApp Forward\n\nClaim:\nSudha Murthy resigned from Tirupathi board and Jagan (Andhra Pradesh CM) has appointed his uncle, \"Yehova Vincent Subbareddy, a staunch Christian evangelist\" as chairman.\n\nFact:\nNewschecker first ran a keyword search which led to a tweet by Paul Oommen, a journalist with The Newsminute, dated June 12, 2019, clarifying that YV Subba Reddy's full name is Yarram Venkata Subba Reddy. Subba Reddy himself replied to the tweet, thanking Oommen for \"reiterating the facts\".\n\nA further search led to a report from The Federal, dated June 22, 2019, which explained that Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy appointed his uncle and senior YSRCP leader YV Subba Reddy as the new chairman of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) Trust board. While the appointment was controversial due to claims about his religion, Subba Reddy denied being a Christian, stating he was a Hindu by birth and would \"die a Hindu\".\n\nA Newsminute report from June 11, 2019, revealed that Sudha Murty quit as a TTD board member on June 6. When asked about her resignation, she clarified it was not politically motivated, saying, \"We were appointed by the previous govt and it is not nice to continue without an invite. My decision was not political, it was just the decent thing to do.\"\n\nResult: False\n\nSources:\n- Tweet by Paul Oommen, June 12, 2019\n- Tweet by YV Subba Reddy, June 12, 2019\n- The Federal article, June 22, 2019\n- The Newsminute article, June 11, 2019",

    "vclaim": "A viral WhatsApp message claims that Sudha Murthy resigned from the Tirupathi board and was replaced by YV Subba Reddy, who is falsely alleged to be a Christian evangelist named \"Yehova Vincent Subbareddy\". YV Subba Reddy's actual full name is Yarram Venkata Subba Reddy, and he has denied being Christian, stating he is Hindu by birth. Sudha Murty resigned from the TTD board because she felt it was appropriate to step down after being appointed by the previous government, not for political reasons.",
