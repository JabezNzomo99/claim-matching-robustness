They were staying in a bunker in Kharkiv for the last few days after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Srikanth, Naveen left the bunker and went to buy some supplies. \"There is a curfew here till 6 am. After 6 am, he went outside to buy some supplies when we were sleeping,\" Srikanth said, adding that Naveen did not inform them before leaving.\n\nThe store from where Naveen went was just 50 metres from the bunker, said Srikanth.\n\nSrikanth said he tried to contact Naveen several times but when he did not pick up his calls, he called some local contacts. \"Someone picked up the call who was speaking in Russian so I gave my phone to one of my neighbours who is a Ukrainian citizen. They talked and he told me what had happened. Then we contacted our head who confirmed it,\" Srikanth told India Today.\n\nSrikanth said he has no idea what is happening outside as shelling is going on at regular intervals. \"Some locals are very nice and help us. We have food for the night. I don't know what will happen tomorrow,\" Srikanth said.\n\n'Not in contact with authorities'\nSrikanth said that no local authorities contacted them. \"Even the Embassy is not saying anything. They said try to move to the western part but there is no transport,\" Srikanth said.\n\nWhen asked about if he and other students had been contacted by the Indian Embassy, Srikanth said, \"We have been assured that we will be evacuated. But I don't know when that will happen. They [Embassy] have asked us to stay indoors.\"\n\nPM Modi speaks to Naveen's family\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Naveen's family and offered condolences. Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai also condoled the demise of Naveen, who was a resident of Haveri district.",
