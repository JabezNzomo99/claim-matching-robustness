    "full_text": "FALSE: There is no case filed at British Luton Crown Court seeking the deportation of Kiambu governor over fraud\n\nA claim submitted for fact-checking via PesaCheck's WhatsApp Tipline that there is a case filed at Luton Crown Court seeking the deportation of Kiambu Governor Kimani Wamatangi over a multi-billion-shilling fraud is FALSE.\n\nThe claim was published by Kenyaonlinenews.com and was titled: \"Kimani Wamatangi: dead or alive? British court seeks answers from the Kenyan government.\"\n\nAccording to the article, two British investigators are asking Luton Crown Court to deport the Kenyan politician over a multi-billion fraud that allegedly took place in Europe between 2009 and 2012. The article did not indicate when the case was filed and purported to cite documents and affidavits from the court.\n\nPesaCheck wrote to the British court to inquire about the purported case against Wamatangi. Denise Dodson, a court clerk at the Luton Crown Court, stated that there is no information about the case cited in the article in their records.\n\n\"I have searched our records and can find no proceedings at Luton Crown Court in relation to Mr Wamatangi,\" the email reads.\n\nAdditionally, there is no information about Wamatangi on the Interpol Red Notice list, which publishes identities of internationally wanted persons.\n\nInterpol declined to comment further, stating they only do so with express approval from the member country concerned. The British High Commission spokesperson also maintained a standard policy of neither confirming nor denying extradition requests.\n\nPesaCheck has examined the claim and found it to be FALSE.",
