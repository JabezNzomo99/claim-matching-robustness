    "full_text": "Fictitious and blatant lies regarding PM Narendra Modi's family members circulating online\n\nGandhinagar: First there was some whatsapp message circulating, and later, the message has come to twitter. A twitter handle with name of Radha Charan Das has catered blatant lies regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Gujarat based family members. Humble statuses of Modi family are well described in the 'India Today' article and they remain unchanged since then. While rest of India may read it, we in Gujarat actually witness it.\n\nThe information being circulated, tweeted and retweeted are comical. For example one tweet claims Prime Minister Narendrabhai's elder brother Somabhai Modi is Chairman of Recruitment Board. Now, the details of recruitment board are available on the websites, and all journos and common people in Gujarat are in know of who is heading recruitment board. While one recruitment board 'Gaun Seva Pasandgi Mandal' is headed by Asit Vora, the other GPSC is headed by Dinesh Dasa. Somabhai Modi absolutely doesn't head any recruitment board. He is not even a member of recruitment board. A thread of lies further claims that Pankajbhai Modi, Narendrabhai's younger brother is Vice President of recruitment board. Now this is the lie of next level. Pankajbhai has nothing to do with any recruitment board in Gujarat or elsewhere. All names of office bearers of recruitment boards are in public domain, and lies of this level are completely surprising.\n\nThe Twitter thread which is copy of Whatsapp message, also make fancy claims such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's relatives are partners in Reliance Malls (Superstores). The fact is that Reliance doesn't partner with individuals for its superstores. Reliance superstores are fully owned by Reliance Industries.\n\nFictitious claims made in reference to other relatives of Prime Minister are also fake. For example the article in India Today reads regarding Amrutbhai: Amrutbhai, 72, retired as fitter for a private company, drawing a salary of less than Rs 10,000 a month in 2005. He leads a quiet, retired life in his four-room middle class dwelling in Ahmedabad's Ghatlodia locality with son, Sanjay, 47, a small entrepreneur, and his wife and two children. Sanjay's son Nirav and daughter Nirali are both engineering students. An ITI certificate holder, Sanjay fashions small engineering spare parts at his lathe machine shop and makes a modest living. The family car, bought in 2009, is parked outside the house, covered. It is sparingly used as the family mostly travels by two-wheeler.\n\nSo Amrutbhai Modi is not into real estate business in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar or anywhere else. Forget largest real estate business, he doesn't own even small real estate business. Prahlad Modi doesn't have Hyundai, Maruti and Honda Four Wheeler Show Rooms in Ahmedabad and Vadodara or anywhere else. He is not in automobile business at all. Bharat Modi doesn't own a petrol pump and likewise contrary to sheer lies presented in these messages circulating online.",
