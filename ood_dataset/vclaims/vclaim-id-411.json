    "full_text": "Here is the extracted fact-check article content:\n\nA new Facebook/Meta rule allows the company to use people's photos without their permission, and posting a notice on your page will stop it from doing so.\n\nBy Samantha Putterman\nNovember 17, 2021\n\nAfter Facebook announced that it changed its name to \"Meta,\" a refurbished rumor surfaced that claims the company can freely use people's photos and messages.\n\n\"The new Facebook/Meta rule starts tomorrow where they can use your photos. Don't forget the deadline is today! This could be used in lawsuits against you. Everything you've ever posted is posted today - even messages that have been deleted. It doesn't cost anything, just copy and post, better than regretting later,\" the warning message begins.\n\nThe second half then instructs people to post a legal notice telling Facebook it isn't allowed to use their content:\n\n\"Under UCC Law Sections 1-207, 1-308... I am imposing my Reservation of Rights...I DO NOT ALLOW Facebook/Meta or any other Facebook/Meta related person to use my photos, information, messages or messages, both in the past and in the future. This statement I inform Facebook/Meta that it is strictly prohibited to disclose, copy, distribute or take any other action against me based on this account and / or its contents. This account content is private and confidential information. Violation of my personal life may be punished by law.\"\n\nWe've seen these posts about fake social media rules before, and this one is just as wrong as the others that came before it.\n\nThere is no such rule change and posting a notice doesn't override the company's terms of use that users agree to when they sign up for an account.\n\nThis online rumor first appeared in November 2012 when Facebook started trading publicly, and while the language is tweaked from earlier iterations, the message remains the same: Post this or else Facebook has control of your content.\n\nBut users cannot just undo the privacy or copyright terms they agreed to when they first signed up and made an account. As well, simply posting a notice will not have any impact on new policy changes.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's data policy and terms of service haven't changed.\n\n\"The Facebook company is now Meta,\" reads a disclaimer at the top of the company's terms of service page. \"While our company name is changing, we are continuing to offer the same products, including the Facebook app from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Service remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data.\"\n\nThe website adds: \"You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.\"\n\nWhile users own the rights to their content, they gave Facebook license to do certain things with that content when they signed up and agreed to the company's terms of service.\n\nBut it isn't so much status updates or photos that Facebook is necessarily interested in, it's data. Facebook, as well as other websites, wants to know details like age, gender, marital status and general interests to help it better target advertisements to its users.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSocial media posts claim that Facebook has a new rule that gives the company permission to use your photos and that posting a notice on your page will bar it from doing so.\n\nThis is an old hoax. There is no such rule change and posting a notice doesn't override the company's terms of use that users agree to when they sign up for an account.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!",

    "vclaim": "Facebook/Meta has allegedly introduced a new rule allowing them to use people's photos without permission. Users are claiming that posting a legal notice on their Facebook page will prevent the company from using their content. The viral warning message claims that Facebook can use all past and present content, including deleted messages, in potential lawsuits against users. Facebook's terms of service have not changed with the Meta rebranding, and users retain intellectual property rights to their content while granting Facebook certain usage licenses upon signup.",
