We, however, learnt that this purported statement had first gone viral in April 2022, raising our doubts on its authenticity.\n\nTaking this as a cue, we ran a keyword search for \"Blinken Jaishankar persecution\", which led us to an NDTV report dated April 14, 2022:\n\n\"In a sharp response to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent comments on a 'rise in human rights abuses' in India, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar has said 'people' are entitled to have views about India's policies but at the same time, New Delhi is 'equally entitled' to have views about them.\"\n\nAt a joint news conference after the 2+2 dialogue of top US and Indian ministers on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said the US is monitoring some recent \"concerning developments\" in India, including what he called a rise in \"human rights abuses\" by some government, police, and prison officials.\n\nWe then came across a The Wire report, dated June 3, 2022, stating that United States Secretary of State Anthony Blinken highlighted \"rising attacks\" in India at the release of the state department's annual report on international religious freedom.\n\nBlinken stated: \"Beyond these countries, the report documents how religious freedoms and the rights of religious minorities are under threat in communities around the world. For example, in India, the world's largest democracy and home to a great diversity of faiths, we have seen rising attacks on people and places of worship...\"\n\nBlinken's statement can be read in the US Department of State press release, dated June 2, 2022, on the launch of the 2021 International Religious Freedom Report, confirming that the viral WhatsApp forward comprises fabricated statements.\n\nConclusion:\nA viral WhatsApp forward claiming US Secretary of State Antony Blinken publicly criticised External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar over attacks on Christians in India, was found to be fake.\n\nResult: False\n\nSources:\n- US Department of State press release, June 2, 2022\n- US Department of State press release, April 11, 2022",
