It can be attributed to various factors, including genetics, stress, hormonal changes, and underlying health conditions. Among these, anaemia is frequently discussed as a potential contributor to hair loss. Anaemia is a condition characterized by a lack of healthy red blood cells, which play a vital role in transporting oxygen to tissues throughout the body. The correlation between anaemia and hair loss has garnered attention, prompting individuals to inquire about the relationship between the two.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the correlation between anaemia and hair loss, shedding light on whether anaemia can lead to hair loss and elucidating the potential mechanisms behind this association.\n\nDoes anaemia cause hair loss?\nIt can. Anaemia in itself might not directly cause hair loss. However, certain types of anaemia, particularly iron-deficiency anaemia, can significantly impact hair health, potentially leading to hair loss indirectly.\n\nResearchers frequently link iron deficiency anaemia to hair loss. This is because iron is essential for the production of haemoglobin in red blood cells. They carry oxygen throughout the body. When the body lacks iron, it may prioritise supplying oxygen to essential organs over the hair follicles, leading to hair problems.\n\nIron deficiency is a common cause of anaemia and is associated with hair loss. Iron plays a crucial role in the production of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen to cells throughout the body, including hair follicles. When the body lacks sufficient iron, it may affect the hair growth cycle, leading to increased shedding or thinning of hair.\n\nThe deprivation of iron can disrupt the normal cycle of hair growth, leading to a condition called telogen effluvium. This condition prompts a larger number of hair follicles to enter the resting state. As a result, there is an increase in hair shedding after a few months.\n\nHow does anaemia affect the process of hair growth?\nIn cases of anaemia, where the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is compromised, the hair follicles might not receive an adequate supply of oxygen. This reduced oxygen supply hampers the normal functioning of these follicles, disrupting their vital role in the hair growth cycle.\n\nThe hair growth cycle consists of three phases: anagen (growth phase), catagen (transitional phase), and telogen (resting phase). Anemia-induced oxygen deprivation can interfere with this cycle, particularly affecting the anagen phase, which is crucial for active hair growth.\n\nAs a result of inadequate oxygenation, hair follicles may enter the telogen (resting) phase prematurely or stay in this phase longer than usual. This disruption in the natural cycle of hair growth can lead to several adverse effects on the hair:\n\n- Weakened hair shafts: Insufficient oxygen and nutrient supply weaken the hair shafts, making them more susceptible to damage, breakage, and overall fragility.\n- Slower growth: Impaired oxygen delivery to the follicles can slow down the rate of hair growth, resulting in hair that grows slowly compared to its normal growth rate.\n- Increased shedding: Anemia-induced disruptions in the hair growth cycle can cause more hair follicles to enter the resting phase simultaneously. Consequently, this can lead to a noticeable increase in hair shedding during the subsequent phase, known as telogen effluvium.\n- Hair thinning or loss: Prolonged and severe cases of anaemia can contribute to hair thinning or even lead to visible hair loss. The weakened follicles may produce thinner, weaker hair strands that are more prone to breakage and shedding.\n\nCan anaemia due to nutritional deficiency cause hair loss?\nIt can. Anaemia, particularly iron deficiency anaemia, often arises due to insufficient intake or absorption of essential nutrients like iron, vitamin B12, and folate. These nutrients play critical roles in treating anaemia and maintaining healthy hair growth.\n\nIron is essential for the proper function of cells, including those in hair follicles. When the body lacks sufficient iron levels, cells involved in hair growth may not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, weakening the hair follicles and resulting in hair loss. If not only diet, a doctor can also prescribe iron supplements for hair growth to meet the nutritional deficiency.\n\nVitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, commonly associated with certain types of anaemia, can also impact hair health. These nutrients are essential for cell division and red blood cell production. The hair growth cycle can be disrupted in their absence, leading to hair thinning or loss.\n\nWhat are the side effects of excess iron intake?\nThere are side effects of excess iron intake. Too much iron in the body can lead to gastrointestinal problems like stomach pain, nausea, and constipation. It may damage organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas. This can lead to conditions like cirrhosis and heart issues. Other effects include joint pain, skin discolouration, weakness, and increased infection susceptibility. In severe cases, it can lead to organ failure. People with conditions affecting iron metabolism should be cautious and seek medical guidance to manage their iron levels.",

    "title": "Yes. Anemia can lead to decreased oxygen supply to the scalp and hair follicles, which may result in hair thinning and hair loss. This happens because reduced oxygen levels can disrupt the normal growth cycle of hair, leading to hair shedding or slower hair growth. Iron deficiency anemia is one of the most common types of anemia, and it is often associated with hair loss.",
    "vclaim": "Iron deficiency anaemia can indirectly cause hair loss by disrupting the hair growth cycle and oxygen supply to hair follicles. Anaemia affects hair growth by compromising oxygen delivery to hair follicles, leading to weakened hair shafts, slower growth, increased shedding, and potential hair thinning. Nutritional deficiencies in iron, vitamin B12, and folate can cause anaemia and subsequent hair loss by affecting cell function and red blood cell production. Excess iron intake can cause various side effects including gastrointestinal problems, organ damage, joint pain, skin discoloration, and in severe cases, organ failure.",
