But in all that denim-wearing time, we bet you've never thought about that tiny extra front pocket for more than a fleeting second, if that.\n\nIn fact, it's probably been more of a nuance in your life, as you push past it to stow your keys in the bigger pocket before heading out the door.\n\nThat little pouch has had several titles throughout the years including, frontier pocket, coin pocket, match pocket and ticket pocket.\n\nBut what is it for exactly?\n\nIt turns out that small pocket on the top right side your jeans was originally created, wait for it ... a watch.\n\n\"It appears on the oldest pair of waist overalls \u2014 the original name for jeans \u2014 in the Levi Strauss & Co. archives that date back to 1879,\" said Tracey Panek, a historian for Levi Strauss & Co.\n\nThose original copper-riveted jeans had a tiny pocket to hold small pocket watches for working men, from carpenters and miners to railroad engineers. And the design stuck ever since!\n\nNowadays, we've upgraded to telling time with smart watches and phones, that teeny pocket is usually empty, but we love the idea of rethinking it for this generation's trinkets.\n\nBring on the liquid matte lipsticks and AirPods!",
