    "full_text": "A post is being shared widely on social media with a claim that only removing the Article 30A will allow schools to teach 'Gita' and 'Ramayana'. Let's try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Article 30A restricts teaching 'Gita' and 'Ramayana' at schools.\n\nFact: There is no Article 30A in the Indian Constitution. Also, Article 30 (1, 1A and 2) deals with the 'rights of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions'. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched about the Article 30A in the Indian Constitution, it was found that there is no 'Article 30A' in the constitution. There are articles 30(1), 30(1A) and 30. But, they also deal with the 'rights of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions'.\n\nArticle 30(1) enables all the minorities (based on religion or language) to establish and administer the educational institutions of their choice. The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) was set up in 2004 and protects the rights of minorities enshrined in Article 30.\n\nTo sum it up, there is no 'Article 30(A)' in the Constitution which bans teaching 'Gita' and 'Ramayana' in schools.",

    "vclaim": "A viral social media post claims that removing Article 30A is necessary to allow schools to teach 'Gita' and 'Ramayana'. Article 30A does not exist in the Indian Constitution, and Article 30 actually deals with minority rights to establish and administer educational institutions.",
