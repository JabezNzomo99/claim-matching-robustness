Here's The Truth Behind Viral Claim Attributed To Asle Toje\n\nClaim\nDeputy leader of the Nobel Committee Asle Toje said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the biggest contender for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nFact\nNo publicly available audio/video shows Toje making such a statement. News reports clarified that the quote was falsely attributed to him.\n\nMainstream and social media ecosystems in India were taken by storm since late Wednesday, with the \"news\" that Deputy Leader of the Nobel Committee Asle Toje declared PM Modi as the \"biggest contender\" for the Nobel Peace Prize. Major news outlets, including the Times of India, Economic Times, CNBC-TV18, and OpIndia, were among the many to report Toje's alleged statement on the Indian PM. Social media platforms were abuzz with users congratulating PM Modi for his \"achievement,\" many also taking a dig at the opposition.\n\nWho Is Asle Toje?\nAsle Toje is the deputy leader of the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee that will select the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. He holds the position until 2024. Toje was in India to address an event organised by a non-profit organisation called India Center Foundation (ICF) earlier this week.\n\nFact Check/Verification\nWe began by analysing Toje's recent address at the India Center Foundation event, but could not spot any mention of PM Modi's prospects of winning the Nobel Peace Prize, neither during his speech nor in the Q & A session.\n\nFollowing this, we skimmed through the various interviews given by Toje to Indian media. Though Toje speaks highly of the Indian Prime Minister, nowhere does he \"reveal\" that PM Modi is the \"biggest contender for the Nobel Peace Prize.\" No credible international news outlets reported the same either.\n\nNews Outlets Call Out Contemporaries For Fake News\nAfter a section of Indian media alleged that Toje called PM Modi the \"biggest contender for the Nobel Peace Prize,\" several other news outlets accused them of carrying \"fake news.\"\n\nNews Laundry published a report titled \"Times Now puts out fake news on PM Modi as the biggest contender for Nobel peace prize\" on March 16, 2023. It analysed the various reports by Times Now, ABP, and the Economic Times on this issue, and concluded that \"none of these media outlets could verify that members of the Nobel panel cannot publicly declare either the nominees or their prospects.\"\n\nIFC Chairman: Indian TV Channels Misquoted Toje\nIn a report dated March 16, 2023, The Print quoted ICF chairman Vibhav K. Upadhyay as saying, \"Indian TV channels have misquoted Mr Toje. He never said that. I hope it is by mistake or by extra enthusiasm, but if this has been done by design, then it is criminal.\"\n\nNobel Prize Website: Names Of Nominees May Not Be Divulged Until 50 Years\nAs per the official website of the Nobel Prize, \"There are 305 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize for 2023 out of which 212 are individuals and 93 are organisations\u2026 Neither the names of nominators nor of nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize may be divulged until 50 years have elapsed.\"\n\nConclusion\nThe viral claim that Deputy Leader of the Nobel Committee Asle Toje named PM Modi as the \"biggest contender\" for the Nobel Peace Prize is false. Though Toje is heard praising PM Modi in several interviews, there is no publicly available audio/video where he is heard or seen making such a statement.\n\nResult: False",
