    "full_text": "The mineral fluoride, at the right dose, has been shown to reduce the risk of tooth decay. Based on studies demonstrating this in children drinking naturally fluoride-containing water, individual cities in the U.S. began to add fluoride to tap water beginning in 1945.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and multiple expert groups endorse water fluoridation as a safe way to reduce tooth decay, including the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nHowever, a Feb. 4 post from independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on X, formerly known as Twitter, made a sweeping claim about fluoride's effects on the nervous system. \"As president. I'm going to order the CDC to take every step necessary to remove neurotoxic fluoride from American drinking water,\" the post said.\n\nKennedy, who has a history of advocating against water fluoridation, accompanied his claim about fluoride's neurotoxicity with a link to a Law360 article about testimony in a trial that has been unfolding in a San Francisco-based federal District Court. The case was brought against the Environmental Protection Agency by nonprofit organizations and other plaintiffs and alleges that fluoridation poses \"an unreasonable risk of injury to health\" under a version of the Toxic Substances Control Act amended in 2016. The plaintiffs are asking the EPA to disallow adding fluoride to drinking water.\n\nUpdate, Sept. 26: A federal District Court judge on Sept. 24 ruled that the EPA must further regulate fluoride in drinking water, although the ruling did not specify what action the agency should take. The ruling stated that the plaintiffs in the case had proven that fluoridation at the level considered optimal in the U.S. \"poses an unreasonable risk of reduced IQ in children.\" However, it added that \"this finding does not conclude with certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health.\" The EPA has a range of options in how it responds, \"from requiring a mere warning label to banning the chemical.\" The EPA is reviewing the decision.\n\nOther popular social media posts have also referenced the trial, claiming that \"multiple studies confirm fluoride is a neurotoxin that violates the Toxic Substances Control Act and reduces IQ in kids.\"\n\nBut the data on water fluoridation and neurotoxicity are less clear-cut than social media posts by Kennedy or others make them out to be.\n\nSome studies \u2014 many of them done in areas of the world with naturally high levels of fluoride in their water supplies well above the optimally recommended level \u2014 suggest a possible association between greater levels of fluoride exposure during pregnancy or early childhood and reduced IQ in children. But many scientific experts have said the evidence for this association is weak.\n\nThe EPA has argued that there isn't strong or consistent evidence fluoridation at recommended levels lowers IQ \u2014 in line with the general sentiment held by the CDC and various expert groups that water fluoridation is safe.\n\n[The full text continues with detailed information about fluoride regulation, research studies, and expert perspectives on water fluoridation safety.]",
