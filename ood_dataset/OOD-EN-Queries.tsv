Anil Ambani's tremendous attack on Rahul Gandhi

¬†¬†¬†A man, not worth a pinch off salt, whose family has always robbed the country, denounces me in every election meeting,

I want to ask him some questions today, hopefully the media will ask off him the answers.

(1) My family and my myself pay tax of 50000+ crores rupees every year to the country. Pay Millions of people, salaries every month, help in running the livelihood of millions of families.

How much money does Gandhi family contribute to this country ????

I have heard that the whole family has been released on bail, by a court,  in a case of tax evasion. Your mother has, reportedly become the fourth richest woman in the world. How has shape become so ? Is it by robbing CRORES, through CORRUPTION ? 
Would appreciate if you let all INDIAN‚Äôs & me know, the business, that your Mother owns & runs, for her to have accumulated, such immense wealth ? Pls reply....

(2) We have been taking loans from banks for the last about 40 years and have payed / are still paying CRORES as interest, payed back the full loan & retaken, new Loans for new business opportunities, all businessmen & industrialists, across the world, without exception, have to, if they want to run any business. We also give guarantees & collateral to the Banks, for atleast, their basic safety, the interest that we pay, allow banks to pat the salaries and interest on all the deposits that the Banks have received from crores off depositer‚Äôs & account holders off theirs.
Tell me how leaders like you and people like your brother-in-law have got a  interest-free loan‚Äôs from Bank‚Äôs ??? What business is he in, that gets him such privileges ???
In which country does these businesses run ??
From which country & Banks has he received such loans from ?

(3) As widely publicised, how has your great brother-in-law,  who started his business, with a paid up Capital off  ‚Çπ 1 lakh, 15 years ago, become owner of CRORES worth off hotels & property, which is running into hundreds off acres off land, all this in a mind boggling 10 years !! How was he able to get such large amounts off money, which was obviously needed to acquire such large tracts off land ? Where did your family get the money to buy & own 2 bungalows and 6 flats in London ???

My dear countrymen
When I came to know that this family is a foreign agent, this party supports anti-nationalists. I have stopped giving donations to the Congress Party, since then they are after me, they are hellbent on defaming me.

Answering to some of allegations against me, my family & Company‚Äôs owned or run by my family, let me ask, a few pertinent questions, answers, of which, too, I would like to get from the Gandhi family, CONGRESS PARTY, 
why wasn‚Äôt the contract off the Delhi Airport Metro Project, The Mumbai Metro Project, not awarded to multiple well regarded, Government Company‚Äôs, but to private players & Pvt Company‚Äôs, by the Manmohan Singh led UPA Government, if that is valid, what is wrong, if my Company, was chosen as a partner, by Dassault. This agenda, is not only hurting me, personally, but also hurting our Country‚Äôs image, WORLDWIDE.
Even In Delhi (formerly DESU) DVB's power supply contract, worth 1200 crores, was given to my Company by the Sheila Dixit Government in place of NTPC (government company) ... WHY ?

Between 2004 and 2014, why did the Congress government, at the Centre & multiple States give my company Reliance Infrastructure a total of 8 national highways and projects (worth 25350 crore) in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Punjab ??
While there are many government companies that could do this work ???

""These are some aspects & truth that the public does not know & should know.""

Please copy paste and share and forward this information to the whole country & oblige.
Thankyou...üôè

*5 Years Fundamentals* 
1. Nursery @ 4 Years
2. Jr KG @ 5 Years
3. Sr KG @ 6 Years
4. Std 1st @ 7 Years
5. Std 2nd @ 8 Years

*3 Years Preparatory*

14. Std FYJC @ 17Years
15. STD SYJC @ 18 Years

*Important things:*

There will be board in 12th class only.
4 years of college degree. 
No 10th Boards
MPhil will also be closed.
(In institutes like JNU, 45 to 50 years old students stay there for many years and pursue MPhil. All these debauched leftist ideologues will now be removed from the institute)

Now students up to 5th will be taught in mother tongue, local language and national language only. The rest of the subjects, even if they are English, will be taught as a subject.
 
Now *just have to take board exams in 12th standard*. Whereas earlier, it was mandatory to take the 10th board exam, which will not happen now.

Examination will be done in the semester form from 9th to 12th class. 
*Schooling will be done under the 5 + 3 + 3 + 4 formula* (see table above).

*College degree will be 3 and 4 years old i.e., a certificate will be given on the first year of graduation, diploma on the second year, degree in the third year*.

3-year degree is for those students who do not have to take higher education. At the same time, students doing higher education *will have to do a 4-year degree. Students doing 4 years degree will be able to do MA in one year*.

--- Now students will not have to do MPhil. *Rather MA students will now be able to do PHD* directly.

*Students will be able to do other courses in between.* Gross enrollment ratio will be 50 percent by 2035 in higher education. *At the same time, under the new education policy, if a student wants to do another course in the middle of a course, then he can take a second course by taking a break for a limited time from the first course.*

Many reforms have also been made in higher education. Improvements include graded academic, administrative and *financial autonomy etc. Apart from this, e-courses will be started in regional languages. Virtual Labs* will be developed. A National Educational Scientific Forum (NETF) will be started. There are 45 thousand colleges in the country.

Uniform rules will be for all government, private, deemed institutions.
According to this rule, new academic session can be started and all students and parents need to carefully read this message."

444,890	"Accidental Death & Compensation:
(Income Tax Return Required)
Knowledge is Power....
If a person has an accidental death and the person was filing income tax returns for the last three years, then the government is obliged to give ten times the average annual income of the last three years to that person's family.
Yes, you will be surprised by this, but this is right and it is Government rule. 
For example, if someone's annual income is  4 lakh 5 lakhs and 6 lakhs in the first, second and third years respectively, its average income is ten times of five lakhs.. means fifty Lac rupees, family of that person is entitled to receive from the Government.
In the absence of much information, people do not take this claim with the Government.
If any return is missing, mainly last three years, this could lower the claim amount or even no claim because court takes ITR as only evidence. 
NO wealth record, FD's; business etc. is given that much importance as compared to ITR in the eyes of law.
Many a time,  people do not file ITRs regularly..or it will be taken lightly..
Due to lack of information the family receives no economic benefits.

(FORMER DGP Maharashtra)

As a citizen of the country I felt it has to be conveyed to them. Modi ji, there is no point in shouting standing in a stage and asking question that what is achieved in 60 years. Dont think that the citizen of our country are fools. You are a Prime Minister of a country which was under British rule for more than 200 years. The people were living just like slaves. Congress came to power in 1947 after independence started with zero. There was nothing in this country except the garbages left out by the British. India didn't even had the resourse to produce even a pin since Britishers left India. The electricity was available only for 20 villages across the country. Telephone facility was available only for 20 rulers (kings) in this country. There was no drinking water supply. There was only 10 small dams. No hospitals, no educational institutions. No fertiliser, no feeds, no water supply for cultivation. There was no job & only starvation in the country. There was many infant death. Very few military staff in the border. Only 4 planes, 20 tankers & fully open borders on all 4 sides of the country. Very minimum roads & bridges. Empty exchequer. Nehru came power in these circumstances.
What is India after 60 years ?
World's largest army. Thousands of war planes, tankers. Lakhs of industrial institutions. Electricity in all villages. Hundreds of electic power stations. Lakhs kilometre of national highways & over bridges. New railway projects, Stadiums, super speciality hospitals, most of the Indian households with television, telephone for all the countrymen. All infrastructure to work in and outside the country, Banks, Universities, AIMS, IITS, IIMS, Nuclear weapons, sub-marines, nuclear stations, ISRO, Navarathna Public sector units.
Indian Army barging till Lahore years back? Split Pakistan into 2 pieces ? 1 lakh of military & commanders surrendered to Indian army? India started exporting minerals & food items ? Bank nationalisation by Mrs. Indira Gandhi? Computer introduces to India & many job opportunities in India and outside the country? You have become PM using information technology?
When you took over as the PM, India was the top 10 economies in the world? Apart from this, GSLV, Mangalyan, Monorail, Metro rail, International airports, Prithvi, Agni, Naag, Nuclear submarines....all these were achieved before you became PM.
Please do not come to people asking what congress has achieved in 60 years.
Please tell people what you have achieved in the last 6 ¬Ω years except changing names, doing statue and cow politics, failed demonetisation, poorly executed GST, and making people stand in long queues. Hypocrite BJPians opposed FDI like anything and now BJP is supporting FDI shamelessly.. BJP is selling India to Ambani and Rafale deal to Anil Ambani's 2-month old company over HAL owned by government of India is a prime example of it.. BJP made petrol, diesel, and LPG price go up by putting more tax, while the price of crude oil became cheaper.. Modi government through SBI in the form of fine collected whopping Rs 1771 crore for not able to maintain minimum balance from the poor people of India. Vikas is happening for Amit Shah's son, Amit Shah, Shaurya Doval, Ambanis, Adani, baba Ramdev's Patanjali group, and the people who sponsors BJP.. 3000 crores have been spent by BJP to clean river Ganga, this corruption each and everyone can find out by taking a dip in river Ganga..

561,334	"Pandemic apart, we are also witnessing a wave of paid Congi trolls, who would have us believe that the government is a failure and had there been a Congi PM, things would have been much better.

It's an unprecedented crisis. A pandemic of gigantic proportions. Let's take our memories back to 2013 when Uttarakhand faced devastation due to flash floods.
25,000 people had died. Many were stranded, waiting for  rescue or imminent death. For three days after disaster struck, no help came from the centre. 

After statewide protests and international media reports, there was an announcement, with zero follow-up action. Congi leadership left for undeclared reasons to The US and Bangkok. When the mom-son duo returned, 8 trucks with biscuits and water, and more importantly huge posters of the mom-son duo were shown the green flag. The supply never reached the people since the truck drivers were uncompensated.

Now 15 days after the flash floods and nothing from the centre, the rotting dead bodies posed a risk of an epidemic. The Uttarakhand government refused assistance from all states to hide its own inaction.

What did happen though was that a company called Blue Breeze Trading Pvt. Ltd. was awarded the contract to extract the dead bodies. The company has only the famous Vadra family on the Board of Directors. The amount paid off to the company from government coffers? A whopping INR 7,36,00,00,000.

The only relief work which happened on the ground was done by the army and paramilitary . That too without any specific directions from the central government. After doing its work,  soldiers quietly went back.

For a political party such as INC, the short memory of the general public is the only saving grace. Thank God, they are not at the helm of affairs right now. I shudder at the devastation caused and the scams which would have enriched the Gandhi/Vadra family, even during a pandemic.

Never forget & never forgive such people.

Unable to answer a journalist's question yesterday about Raghuram Rajan's complaint against him, * P. Chidambaram * canceled the show halfway and left.

* Reporter: *

Has former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan complained to you that you sold Indian rupee printing machine to Pakistan?

* Chidambaram *

That's true. As the life of the machine came to an end we tendered to bid on it. Pakistani company Karan is a big sucker. We sowed.

* Reporter *:

Is it right that you sold the machine to Pakistan despite knowing that our Indian rupee notes are being counterfeited in Pakistan?

* Chidambaram *

I cannot answer questions based on conjecture. Pakistan is a good country

* Reporter *

While the Reserve Bank has said that 99 per cent of the 500,1000 rupee notes have been returned to the bank, you have said that if Congress comes to power again, we will make the old rupee notes valid. So is it true that you hoarded Rs 5 lakh crore in Pakistan as the governor said?

* Chidambaram *

Let Congress come to power. He got up and left angrily as he told you to just look at what you had all done. The show was half over.

Share from Tamilnadu

A total of 15 lakh crore 500 and 1000 rupee notes were banned during the currency crisis. We lied that they had all come back. But in reality only 10 lakh crores came.

The reason why we lied is to keep track of who owns the remaining 5 lakh crores and what their next move is.

It was only when this fact came to light that the tendency of conflict between the Central Government and me caused a model drama and I resigned as the Governor of the Reserve Bank.

I have found out where the total money is. If Congress comes to power they will turn everything into a valid note.

Not only that. Pakistani militants have obtained a machine to print Indian money from Nashik through former Union Minister P. Chidambaram. P. Chidambaram alone has received a gift of 10 crore rupees for this.

With this machine, they had planned to smuggle about 8 lakh crore rupees of Indian currency in Pakistan into India. I got confidential information. I took it to Prime Minister Modi and told him. Soon after, he declared the 500 and 1000 rupee notes invalid. He is so fast that no one else can even imagine.

If that 8 lakh crore rupees had infiltrated the country, this time it would have turned into Somalia.

A total of Rs 13 lakh crore of counterfeit currency is ready outside the country. If Congress comes to power it will come back into the country. The country will fall.

The whole planet united in prayer. If you can forward it please join us in urgent prayer, also because the radical Islamic group has just taken Quaragosh, the largest Christian city in Iraq.

623,286	"Great victory for Bharat! P.M. Modi‚Äôs Chanakya diplomacy! UK was defeated on the world stage!
One example of how PM Modi has devefloped friendship with many countries came out in the open with the recent election of Justice Dalveer Bhandari as the Chief Justice of the International Court of Justice. He received 183 votes (one from each country represented) out of 193 votes and thus soundly defeated UK‚Äôs Christopher Greenwood. This broke a 71-year monopoly UK had on this position.
Pakistan Military Council has sentenced Shri. Kul bhushan to death claiming false evidence of espionage and sabotage. India has protested. The trial in this case is going on in the International Court of Justice. Under such circumstances it is vitally important to have an Indian Chief Justice. It was a prestige point for Bharat.

To achieve this, PM Modi and his External Affairs Ministry have been working since last 6 months. It was a very difficult task to contact the representatives of 193 countries and convince them about India‚Äôs position! To add to the tension the opponent was a UK person-who was almost sure to win!
In 11 rounds of voting, Justice Dalveer Bhandari won 183 out of 193 votes in general assembly and all 15 out of 15 votes from the members of the UN Security Council. 
Mr. Greenwood has conceded that he lost the election. Mr. Dalveer Bhandari has his new position for a tenure of 9 years. He will surely do the right things for Shri. Kul Bhushan Yadav. 
Until he is safely released back to India, let us all pray for his safety and complete exoneration. 
Are these 183 nations who voted for India ‚Äúblind Modi Bhakts‚Äù? 
PM Modi, when he has traveled abroad, did not go on a sightseeing pleasure trip!

Joseph Hope, Editor-in-Chief of the New York Times:

Narendra Modi's sole aim is to make India a better Country. If he is not stopped, in the future, India will become the most Powerful Nation in the World.. It will surprise even  the USA, the United Kingdom, and Russia..Japan.

Narendra Modi is moving towards a specific goal. No one knows what he wants to do....and his intentions, strategy, cannot be predicted.

Behind the Smiling face, he is a dangerous Patriot. He uses all the Countries of the world for the benefit of his Nation......India.

First he destroyed US ties with Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Next Narendra Modi has created an alliance with Vietnam, shattered China‚Äôs Superpower dream and made use of the three Countries.
 
The long-running dispute over oil extraction overseas between Vietnam and China has benefited India. With India's support, Vietnam began producing Oil in China's Southern Seas.

Vietnam now supplies all of its Oil to India. The United States has different support for this. He made Pakistan a poor Country without going into a war.

He brought the Port of Iran under his control.

He has set up an Indian Military base on the border with Afghanistan, very close to the area that divides Pakistan.

In order to increase Indian trade, he has also built a route through Iran (leaving Pakistan) to Afghanistan.

Narendra Modi‚Äôs desires are going Up one by one. Sections 370 and 35A have been repealed.

One day he will completely capture Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Pakistan will fall into 4 pieces in the coming seasons. This will happen on the warning of Narendra Modi.

Saudi Arabia, Pakistan's traditional ally, will also play a Key role in the Partition of Pakistan..

In Asia, this man who finished China and the United States, has  canceled the SAARC Summit and shown his power to the World.. Narendra Modi has succeeded in maintaining India's superiority over Asia..

He made UAE fine the Foreign minister of Pakistan on landing in UAE & sent the minister back. Malaysia took over a Pakistan airplane to recover debts owed by Pakistan.

Russia and Japan, 2 of Asia's Major Powers, have done nothing to say.

He held both Countries in his hands with great precision. In the case of China's Vietnam Oil issue, China will ask for Oil... Then he will ask Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. ü§ü

What he would ask was, ""I'll take it.. You have Hair in your Mouth,"" and tease China's Vietnam issue..

Nothing can be done by China. This person is taking Indian Politics to a totally different level.

Many Countries think and act as if each Country has many Enemies.. But India has no Enemies other than Pakistan. India is almost certain to be a friend to all Countries of the World.

This man is doing more harm to Pakistan than the real War.. By using Muslim Countries against Pakistan, Narendra Modi has proven himself to be one of the Best leaders in the World.
 
Even if Pakistan goes for War with India, there will not be so much loss.. But now Pakistan is suffering more than that.

In all negotiations with all Countries, this person's Honesty must be taken into account.

India's progress will be difficult for the rest of the World.

With the current astounding growth of India, all the Countries in the United Nations will experience the consequences..!

In the last few years, I have lost at least 8 to 9 people known to me personally, and a few celebrities too, who were in their 40s who died because of doing too much to be ""fit"". 

Unfortunately they only looked fit, six packs and all. Today Puneeth Rajkumar gets added to this list.

In anything in life, MODERATION is the mantra. Any extreme of zero or 100 is not correct. 

A moderate amount of exercise, just about 20mins, eating everything, no detoxification or keto moto diets, just eat what your ancestors have been eating, the local and seasonal food in your hometown, not kale, kiwi or olive oil..., but in small quantities, sleeping a full 7 hours, respecting your body by not feeding it steroids, performance enhancement drugs are all that you need to do.

Just eat all that you ate growing up, in small quantities, exercise for 20mins to 30mins...just a good walk should do perfectly and stop all supplements....if you drink, limit it to a couple of pegs a week, if you absolutely can't give up smoking, a couple a day .. .you get my drift??? 
Anything but in moderation. 

Add a bit of silent meditation to your routine.Most importantly, listen to your body. Understand it.

By 40 the body is undergoing a lot of changes, 50 even more, 60 plus your body is starting to slow down, 70 plus, your body is starting to shut down, 80 plus every year is a bonus. So, stop saying 60 is the new 40, 50 is the new 30...no it isn't, if you are 40 or 50 plus, be grateful if you're healthy, slow down so your heart can keep pace, 

Please understand retirement has been suggested for a reason, your body and mind cannot take the stress which you once endured. Outwardly you could be looking good, thank your genes but inside, the organs are aging.

Be *Happy* internally and not externally."
673,004	"End of Microwave industry!!!!!             Japan govt has decided to dispose of all the  *Microwave Ovens* in the country before this year end.

Reason for this ban: University of Hiroshima's scientists researched and found that ""radio waves"" from microwave ovens cause greater harm to health over the last 20 yrs, than the US atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Sep 1945.

Experts found that food heated in  microwave ovens has very unhealthy vibrations and radiation.

All the factories of ""microwave ovens"" in Japan are being closed. 

S Korea announced plans to close all ""microwave ovens"" factories by 2021, and China by 2023.

A conference on cancer prevention held @ Kashira Cancer Center recommended:
1. No Refined oil
2. No Milk of animal origin (recommended soya milk)
3. No Food cubes (chicken broth spices like Maggie etc)
4. No Soda (32 pieces of sugar per liter)
5. No Refined sugar
6. No Microwave ovens
7. No mammogram before birth, except echocardiography
8. No Very narrow underwear and bra
10. Do not re-freeze thawed food. 
11. Do not drink chilled water kept in plastic bottles stored in the fridge. 
12. Avoid  deodorants used after shaving or baths because they cause cancer.

The conference advise adding these to your diet :
1. Vegetables
2. Honey moderately used instead of sugar
3. Plant proteins (beans instead of meat)
4. 2 cups of water at body temp on  empty stomach before brushing teeth
5. Food should be warm and not very hot
6. Aloe vera juice + ginger + parsley + celery + bromalin (Mix and drink on an empty stomach) 
7. Carrot juice daily
8. Tomato, garlic onion with meals

Note : The American Physicians Association found the causes of cancer:
1. Do not drink anything hot in plastic cups
2. Do not eat anything hot wrapped in paper or cardboard or in a plastic bag (eg fried potatoes)
3. Don't eat in plastic or microwave dishes

Note:
When plastic is exposed to heat, chemicals dat can cause 52  cancer types are released.

You must also avoid drinking all kinds of soft drinks such as ""Cola, Pepsi, Av, Fanta and all concentrated juices because cancer feeds on sugar. Eat fresh pineapples and avoid pineapple mix. Don't eat heavy food after 7pm. 

Drink more water in the morning and less in the evening. Do not take a horizontal position (lying down/sleep) immediately after eating.

704,739	"Reminder: 
On the 16th day of June 2013 there was a huge flood in Kedarnath in the Uttarakhand state causing heavy destruction and casualties. 25,000 pilgrims died in the heavy flood which continued for three consecutive days. The Congress Government didn't take any measures to rescue the pilgrims who were trapped in Kedarnath. On the fourth day the international community came to know of the terrible disaster and the news became the headlines of international media! It was only then that the shameless Congress Government made a declaration of assistance!
But it was only a declaration, on the 18th of June Sonia Gandhi went to the United States of America for some medical treatment, and Rahul Gandhi was in Bangkok. They were informed and they returned to India on the 21st of June!
After a huge media coverage the Congress Government sent packets of biscuits and mineral water in eight trucks. All these trucks were carrying huge posters of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and the mother and son waved flags to start off the convoy. Photos were taken and were in the front pages of print media and the news became the headlines of all national newspapers. But neither the hiring charges nor the cost of diesel were paid, so after traveling for eight days the truck drivers sold the mineral water bottles and packets of biscuits to recover their hiring charges and costs of diesel and went back! Till today nobody ever asked what happened to the biscuits and mineral water bottles sent as rations for the poor pilgrims!
Then when the corpses started putrefaction and started smelling after 15 days the local villagers started a movement in fear of spread of epidemics! The villagers themselves performed cremation of the corpses but we're afraid on seeing the shear numbers of corpses spread over large areas! Then the corpses of the Hindu pilgrims were traded, the Congress Government called a tender for the removal of the dead bodies! A company called the tender and was given the tender at the rate of ‚Çπ 4,60,000 per removal of each of the dead bodies! A total number of 16,000 dead bodies were removed in the next three days. The Government immediately cleared the payment of ‚Çπ 7,36,00,00,000 which is unusually fast considering the red tapism of the officials! More bodies were continuously discovered for months, then skeletons were discovered after that!
Can you guess who was the owner of the company responsible for the disposal of the bodies?
Who else except the National son in law Robert Vadra who established the company with hired choppers! The biscuits and mineral water bottles sent by the mother and son didn't reach even today!
It was the biggest trade of dead bodies in the history of the world!
Just trying to remind you about a scam,

Justice Dalveer Bhandari has been elected as the Chief Justice of the International Court of Justice.

He broke the 71-year monopoly on this post of Britain.
 PM Modi and the Ministry of External Affairs are working for the last 6 months to achieve this!  It was a very difficult task to contact representatives of all 193 countries and explain to them India's position regarding a British candidate who was sure to win it easily.  In 11 rounds of voting, Justice Dalveer Bhandari got 183 out of 193 votes in the General Assembly and all 15 out of 15 members of the United Nations Security Council.
 Justice Dalveer Bhandari will hold this post for a term of 9 years.  Are these 183 countries ""blind Modi bhakts"" who voted for India!

782,806	"# Why is  *Collector Madam* not wearing *makeup* ...?

 Malappuram District Collector *Ms Rani Soyamoi* interacts with college students.
 ............................................
She wore no jewelry other than a wristwatch.
What surprised most of the students was that she did not even use *face powder*.
   
The speech is in English.  She spoke for only a minute or two, but her words were full of determination.
The children then asked the collector some questions.

 Q: What's your name?

My name is Rani, Soyamoi is my family name.  I am a native of *Jharkhand*.

Anything else to ask ?.

A slender girl stood up from the audience.
Ask, child.

""Madame, why don't you use any makeup?""

The collector's face suddenly turned pale.  Sweat broke out on her thin forehead.  The smile on her face faded.  The audience suddenly became silent.

She opened the water bottle on the table and drank a little.  Then she gestured, slowly, to the  student to sit.  Then she began to speak,  slowly.

You have asked a troubling question.  It is something that can never be answered in a single word.  I have to tell you my life story in answer.  Let me know if you are willing to set aside your precious ten minutes for my story.

Ready ...

I was born in a tribal area of ‚Äã‚ÄãJharkhand. The Collector paused and looked at the audience.

I was born in a small hut in the tribal area of ‚Äã‚Äã*Koderma* district, full of ""Mica"" mines.

My father and mother were miners.  I had two elder brothers and a younger sister.  We lived in a small hut that leaked when it rained.

My parents worked in the mines for meager wages because they could not find another job.  It was a very messy job.

When I was four years old, my father, mother and two brothers were bedridden with various ailments.

Little did they know at the time that the disease was caused by inhaling the deadly mica dust in the mines.

When I was five, my brothers died of an illness.

With a small sigh the Collector stopped talking and wiped her eyes with her handkerchief.

Most days our diet consisted of *plain water and one or two rotis*.  Both my brothers left this world due to acute illness and starvation.  In my village, forget a doctor there was no school.  Can you imagine a village without a school, a hospital or even a toilet, without electricity?  .

One day my father grabbed 
my starved, skin and bones hand and walked me to a big mine covered with tin sheets.

It was a mica mine that had gained notoriety over time.

It was an ancient mine that was dug up and dug up,  extending seemingly endlessly into the underworld.  My job was to crawl through the tiny caves at the bottom and collect mica ores.  It was only possible for children under the age of ten.

For the first time in my life, I ate a full stomach of rotis.  But that day I vomited.

At the time I should be in first class, I was collecting mica in dark rooms where I was breathing *poisonous dust*.

It was not uncommon for unfortunate children to die in occasional *landslides*.  And occasionally some with *fatal diseases*

After working eight hours a day, you could earn at least enough for a one time meal.  I had become thinner and dehydrated because of hunger and inhalation of poisonous gases, every day.

A year later my sister also started going to work in the mine.  As soon as they were a little better, it came to a point that my father, mother, sister and I worked together and we could live without hunger.

But fate was beginning to haunt us in another form.  One day when I was not going to work due to high fever, it suddenly rained.  Hundreds of people died when the mine collapsed on the workers at the base of the mine.  Among them were my father, mother and sister.

Tears began to flow through both eyes of Rani.  Everyone in the audience forgot to even breathe.  The eyes of many were filled with tears.
 
You have to remember that I was only six years old.

Eventually I arrived at the Government Agati Mandir.  There I was educated.  I had learned my first alphabets from my village.  Finally here is the collector in--Message truncated--"
795,391	Burnt Candlemas was a failed invasion of Scotland in early 1356 by an English army commanded by King Edward III, and was the last campaign of the Second War of Scottish Independence. Tensions on the Anglo-Scottish border led to a military build-up by both sides in 1355. In September a nine-month truce was agreed, and most of the English forces left for northern France to take part in a campaign of the concurrent Hundred Years' War. A few days after agreeing the truce, the Scots, encouraged and subsidised by the French, broke it, invading and devastating Northumberland. In late December the Scots escaladed and captured the important English-held border town of Berwick-on-Tweed and laid siege to its castle. The English army redeployed from France to Newcastle in northern England.

But this one number is very strange and al GBl the mathematicians  in the world were astounded ! 

This number was discovered by an Indian mathematician. 

Look at this number 2520. It seems to be one of many numbers ‚Ä¶But in reality it is not, it is a number that has surprised many mathematicians around the world.
This number can be divided by any number from 1 to 10: 
Whether even or odd

 It sounds really amazing and impossible.  But let‚Äôs look at the table below: 

 2520 √∑ 1 = 2520
 2520 √∑ 2 = 1260
 2520 √∑ 3 = 840
 2520 √∑ 4 = 630
 2520 √∑ 5 = 504
 2520 √∑ 6 = 420
 2520 √∑ 7 = 360
 2520 √∑ 8 = 315
 2520 √∑ 9 = 280
 2520 √∑ 10 = 252

The secret of the number 2520 is hidden in the following multiplication :        
7 √ó 30 √ó 12 
This number represents strangely the concept of time  as seen below : 

Days of the week (7)
Days of the month (30)                 Months in a year (12)                    And so :

Hope u know, the biggest bank scamsters are not Vijay Malaya or Nirav Modi; not even Mehul Choksi. But it‚Äôs the Rishi K. Aggarwal & family, of ABG Shipyard, with offices in Surat, Mumbai, Pune. The fraud they did is almost equivalent to all 3 of them put together, a mind boggling ‚Çπ22,842 crores üòØ‡•§

Of course during Congi period, starting from 2012; were given another 10,000 crores despite defaulting on previous loans in March 2014 (before Modi came in) to ‚Äòrestructure‚Äô previous loans, under a fraudulent scheme called CDR. Not 1 or 2, but 28 sarkari banks involved, led by SBI (2468 crores), and including BOB, BOI, IDBI, PNB, even LIC. 

CBI yesterday raided 13 places belonging to the Aggarwals; based on FIR lodged by SBI. Of course a lot of time has been wasted in raiding.

There is nothing in this world more real than death. !

The most expensive branded car in the world is parked in my garage. But I'm taken in a wheelchair.!

Expensive clothes expensive shoes expensive things all kinds of designs and colors in the world. But I'm in a small_gown provided by the hospital.!

I have lots of money in my bank account but nothing is useful to me.!!

My house is like a castle like a palace but I'm lying in a small bed in the hospital.

I kept traveling to five star hotels in the world. But I'm transferred to labs in hospital to other labs!

That day 7 hair stylists used to do me everyday. But today my head_no hair.

Had food with many high star hotels around the world. But today two tablets in the day and a drop of salt at night. !

Flying around the world on a private jet. But today two_people helping to come to hospital veranda. ?

Not all facilities helped me. Not consoling in any way. !

 But

And the faces of some lovely ones And their prayers keep me alive. !

This is how life is...
Not helping anyone...

Avoid respecting people who are just money, position and power....

Love people with good humanity.."

*Sardar Patel said, ""This law is a great betrayal of the Hindus, so if this Gurney Act is brought into the Constitution, I will resign from the Cabinet and the Congress Party... then I will fight against this betrayal, Gurney Act, along with all Indians... from the front!*

*Nehru had to kneel before Sardar Patel's determination...*
                   
*Unfortunately... I do not know how... in a few months Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel died unexpectedly...*

*After Patel's death, Nehru incorporated this law into the Constitution*.

*Let me tell you the features of 30 A*

*Under this Act - Hindus are not allowed to teach their ""Hindu religion"" among Hindus. ""Law 30A"" does not give it permission or authority... then Hindus should not teach Hindu Dharma in their own private colleges... should not start colleges to teach Hinduism... should not start Hindu schools to teach Hinduism.  The teaching of Hinduism in government schools or colleges is not permitted under Act 30A...*

*But... The strange thing is that with this 30A, there is another law that Nehru enacted in their constitution - ""Act 30""*

*According to this ""Law 30"" Muslims can start and start Islamic religious schools for their religious education... Muslims can teach their religion... Law 30 gives full authority and permission to Muslims to start their own 'Madrasa' ...and Article 30 of the Constitution gives Christians full authority and permission to set up their own religious schools and colleges and to teach and propagate their religion freely...!!!*

*Another legal aspect of this is that all the money and wealth of Hindu temples can be left to the will of the government... All the money and other donations made by Hindu devotees in Hindu temples can be taken to the state treasury...*

*At the same time, donations from Muslim and Christian mosques and churches can be made and given entirely to the Christian-Muslim community... This is how the features of this ""Law 30"" go...*

*So ""Law 30A"" and ""Law 30"" are blatant discrimination and blatant betrayal of Hindus.*

*Everyone should know and understand this well...!!!*

895,963	"Some Tales Untold:

A Young Kashmiri lad Iftikaar Bhatt, with shoulder length hair and wearing the traditional Kashmiri Pheran, approached the dreaded Hizbul Mujahideen in Shopian, Kashmir sometime during 2003.
When asked why he wanted to fight the Indian army, he threw the choicest expletives at the army in chaste kashmiri, whom he held responsible for his brother's death during a stone pelting incident. 

When his story checked out, he was taken to Pakistan for further training. Unlike other recruits this young lad displayed outstanding initiative and religious zeal and was promptly marked for further leadership and ideological training.

He was finally given a chance to cross the LOC and carry out an attack on an Indian army Outpost. In an unprecedented move, he was deputed directly under Abu Sabjar and Abu Torara(war names), Commanders of Hizbul Mujahideen with decades of effective insurgency experience under their belt, for further grooming and leadership training.

In 2004, he convinced both that he can carry out an attack on the army outpost causing maximum damage. He took them to a vantage point and detailed his plan, impressing them both.

Abu Sabjar though had a doubt as to how this young guy, with no military experience, could plan a military attack so meticulously. He started asking him questions about his background and story. 

Sensing the distrust the young lad gave them his AK47 and said they can shoot him if they don't trust him and walked away with his back to them. Going a few paces, he stopped, pulled out his Tokarev 9mm pistol from his waistband and shot them both Dead. Two to the chest, one to the head. Trademark shots of an Indian army Para SF operator. 

The two terrorist commanders didn't know what or who hit them. Iftikaar Bhatt picked up all the weapons walked to the nearest army camp.
 
His real name was Major Mohit Sharma, 1 Para SF, (Madras Regiment) Indian army.

Later, he killed 4 terrorists and rescued 2 of his colleagues.

This officer laid down his life in cordon and search operations in Kashmir in 2009. His last words to his 2IC was, ""Make sure not one escapes the net.""

Yesterday was his death anniversary.

 *The English article by Joseph Hopp, editor-in-chief of the famous American newspaper New York Times.*
 ===================
 The rise of this man is a threat to the world, as he has not only made enemies of each other for the sake of India but has also used them.  It only shows the interest of making India a great country.  To this man, the sole goal is to make India supreme.  If this person is not stopped, then in the future it will happen that one day when India will become a powerful nation in the whole world and then it will overwhelm America too.

 He is pursuing a particular strategy and no one understands what his strategy is.  Behind his smiling face is hidden a dangerous nationalist patriot.  He is using all the countries of the world for the benefit of India.

 The US will end its dominance in Asia by severing ties with Pakistan and Afghanistan, befriending its enemies like Vietnam, and now Modi will be seen using three countries against China.
 Beginning to produce oil in the South China Sea in Vietnam, all the oil from there is given to India, and the Indian company Reliance was forced to operate, here too American domination, will come to an end.
 At the moment, China's enemy is US control over Vietnam, which is to India's advantage.  .
 By pitting China and the United States against each other, India has invested ‡•® 1.2 trillion from both the countries which India could not get in eight years.

 Today, this man is turning Pakistan into a beggar country by turning it over to his old allies, such as the port in Iran, which is close to the Afghan border, and the Indian military station on the Afghan border.  Iran has also been given the opportunity to trade with India, paving the way for Pakistan to go to Afghanistan.
 Sections 370 and 35A were repealed and Pakistan was brought to its knees.  Now one day POK will take over the whole of Kashmir to India.  And Pakistan will fall into four parts.  And K will dance at the behest of Modi.
 Saudi Arabia, Pakistan's traditional ally, will also be instrumental in separating Pakistan from Pakistan.

 This man has ended the dominance of China and the US over Asia and shown his power to the world by canceling the SAARC summit.
 Modi has succeeded in establishing India's dominance over Asia ...
 This has been achieved by befriending two great powers in Asia, Russia and Japan. And China's decline has begun.  Two months ago, China realized that Modi could wipe out China's name today by launching a four-pronged attack if China tried to raise its voice with India.  Now China has to separate Hong Kong.  Modi is ready to take over POK to block CPEC, so China is ready to give up to 40% share to India by calling Modi today, but Modi is not in the mood to listen, so Modi has kept Pakistan as a beggar without a war.  As a result, China's 62 62 billion is in the water.

 By lobbying in the US government, Modi has given India a place in the M TCR group.  And in a short span of time, Modi will also secure the country's place in the NSG.  Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation.  Moreover, this person has taken Indian politics to a different level.
 The world should think that all countries have many enemies of each other, but India has no enemy other than Pakistan.  The solution is almost certain in India.
 This guy can use tactics like surgical strikes.  This man is doing more damage to Pakistan than the actual war.
 By using Muslim countries against Pakistan, Modi has proved that he is a great leader in the world today.
 In all these conspiracies, the cunning of this person is like paying attention.  India's progress will be difficult for the rest of the world.
 That is why I am on the side of discussion and thinking by all the thinkers in the world, I advocate the idea that all nations should form a united opposition.  If possible, a backward country like India should try not to become a world power.  Otherwise the United Nations and all mankind will have to bear the consequences.

*Know Christian Leaders of India*  
(Hidden under the guise of Hindu name) 

Arvind Kejriwal is not a Hindu but a Crypto Christian.  He got converted to Christianity while working with Mother Teresa. He was also allowed to go to that part of the Vatican, where only Christians can go. When Mother Teresa was being given the title of saint,  then the Vatican had invited only Arvind Kejriwal from among the Chief Ministers of the whole of India.

 The word 'crypto' in Greek means hidden or secret. ""Crypto Christian"" means Secret-Christian...!  The important aspects in this are:

 * Crypto-christian is not an abusive or negative word. Crypto-Christianity is an institutional practice of Christianity in a country in which Christians live under the basic principle of crypto-Christianity.  There they worship the God of that country as a show, follow the religion that country which is their camouflage.  But in reality they are Christians inside and continue to preach Christianity continuously.

 * The earliest examples of crypto Christians are found in the Roman Empire  when Christianity had set its feet in Rome in the early stages.  The great Roman emperor Trajan immediately saw Christianity as a threat to Roman culture as many Romans had become Christians. He  proposed to them, ""either leave Christianity or suffer the death penalty"".  Roman Christians pretended to leave Christianity to avoid the death penalty.  And after that they continued to worship Roman Gods and Goddesses superficially.  But they believed in Christianity from inside.  

*  This is similar to the Muslims when they are 5-10 percent.  Then follow the laws of that country.  But when they are 20-30 percent,  the demand for Shariat begins.  Riots happen.  Ethnic cleansing of non-Muslims starts as the population increases further.

 * But crypto Christians do not commit violence like Muslims.  When Crypto Christian is less than 1 percent, he keeps doing his work by adopting the God of that country.  As and when they become more in number, they start insulting the same deities.  Hollywood's famous film Agora (2009) every Hindu must see. It shows, how when crypto Christians became more in number in Rome, they started insulting Roman Gods and Goddesses. 

* At present, in India also crypto Christians have taken hold.  So, here also the work of abusing Hindu deities, Brahmins has started. Means, the work which happened 2000 years ago in Europe is happening today in India. 

* Recently  Professor Kedar Mandal called Goddess Durga as a prostitute. 

 * There are many such crypto -Christians in India.  They are amongst us, wearing the mask of secularism, leftism and Buddhism.  The Christian population in India is officially 20 million.  And it will not be surprising if 100 million Christians come out in India.  The estimated Christian population in Punjab alone is above 10 percent.  Many Christians of Punjab are under the camouflage of Sikhism, wear a turban.  They also wear beard, kirpan, kada, and follow Sikhism.  But they are all secret-Christians.

 * Many crypto-Christians have Hindu names to take reservation.  In these, the names of many are on Gods like Ram, Krishna, Shiva, Durga etc., whom even the people of the Sangh cannot understand as non-Hindu even in dreams. 
 
* Former President
 K R Narayanan was a crypto-christian, who was a Dalit throughout his life for receiving all the benefits of reservation.  And when he died, we saw the process of burial according to Christianity.  

* So understood that this is crypto-Christian.  There are many such crypto-Christians in the country.  Those who are only increasing the agenda of Vatican by attacking Hinduism in Hindu names. We see such crypto-Christians every day in everyday life.  But they can't be understood as they hide under the camouflage of Hindu names.  

 * Congress leader  Ambika Soni, who described Shri Ram as fictional, is a crypto Christian. Most of NDTV's staff are crypto-Christians.

Although while travelling to her workplace,  the American security machinery was in place - albrit from a distance, so that the restaurant's owner, other employees or customers would not know.
*Despite being famous, being humble is a sign of great humility  and good parental  grooming...* *_Obama's daughter did it...  and for the past 2-3 years, especially in the Indian media, she's gained a lot  of unsolicited publicity and popularity..._*

But do you know -  the full name of this 5.4'  tall Swati...?
Her name is *Ms. Swati Kovind!*
Yes, you've guessed it right - *she's the Daughter of President Ramnath Kovind!*
Until now, even the ‚ÄòAir India‚Äô authorities did not know about this. 
Neither Pres. Ramnath Kovind nor his daughter Swati Kovind disclose the matter, so it was a secret till recently...! 
But it's no longer a secret... because ‚ÄòAir India‚Äô has been handed over to the Tatas.
*Upon learning the fact, the present Tata authorities have honourably and silently transferred Swati Kovind from the post of flight attendant to the internal affairs division of the ‚ÄòAir India‚Äô office - probably out of concern for her special security needs (as the President's daughter).*

*_Deep respects to our President... he's quietly done his work of instilling sterling qualities... in his daughter... a rare example in today's venomos opposition politics._*

The greatness of Great people never remains hidden. It should be given proper publicity so that others learn to follow such values in their life style too.

```The petitioner said that use of loudspeakers certainly takes away the right of the citizens to speak with others, their right to read or think or the right to sleep.
‚ÄúThere may be heart patients or patients suffering from nervous disorder may be compelled to bear this serious impact of sound pollution which has had an adverse effect on them. Toddlers, kids are equally affected,‚Äù he added..!```

In the future there will be no BJP, no DMC, no Congress, no Left Front, Islam is the second largest religion in India.

  Professor Nasir bin Sulaiman ul Omar of Saudi Arabia says India is in a deep sleep.  Islam is growing rapidly and thousands of Muslims have infiltrated the police, army, bureaucracy and entered the important organization, Islam is the second largest religion in India.

  Today India is also on the brink of extinction.  Just as the rise of a nation takes decades, its destruction requires time.

  India will not end overnight.  It will be gradually removed.  We as Muslims pursue it very seriously.  India will definitely perish.
  About 65,000 babies are born every day in India.  Of these, about 40,000 are Muslim children and about 25,000 are Hindus and children of other religions.  That is, the birth rate is about 20% of the total population of Muslims !!!  Of the children born now, Muslims are the majority and Hindus are the minority.  At this rate, by 2050, Muslims will be the majority in India.

  No one will stop India from becoming a Muslim country and India will immediately burn in the fire of riots.  We Muslims will kill Hindus and bring them to an end.  Today, according to government figures, Muslims make up about 20% of the population, but in reality they exceed 25%.

  Government figures are inaccurate because Wahhabi Muslims deliberately conceal real numbers and do not register this growing population as their weapon to keep Kafir Hindus unaware.

  Great fraud is going on in India in the name of secularism, but unfortunate Hindus are still in a deep sleep.
  Why did the Hindus not learn a lesson by looking at Kashmir, where the Hindus had to leave all their wealth and women and girls behind.

  India is secular as long as Hindus are in the majority, they do not know what will happen to them when they are a minority ????

  These stupid Hindus do not even understand this from the statistics of the infidels of Pakistan and Bangladesh.  ""

  The Hindu will never speak, will remain silent, will take a high moral position, ..... So, his destiny will surely sink ....

  Pakistan and Bangladesh or Kashmir .. For example, Hindus are sure to come to an end.

  Consider the Muslim-majority areas of Kerala, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad and other states.

  Never go to an area where there are Muslim people in your city, you may be holding your breath between their staring eyes!

  Apart from this, countries like Zambia and Malaysia are examples.

  With the arrival of the Muslim majority, these secular countries were declared Islamic countries.

  Violence occurs daily in countries such as London, Sweden, France and Norway.  ""

  Have you ever wondered why this is happening?  Who does ??  What is the purpose ??

  It is part of the peacekeeping tactic to create such panic among the people and instill fear without the courage to speak in their hearts!  Don't you understand, they gather in the mosque 5 times a day in the name of Namaz and conspire against you !!  !!  They take a pledge and decide to finish you 5 times a day .... !!!

  Therefore, closing the eyes and mouth is not effective.  It is time to open our eyes and open our mouths and raise awareness among the people
Less time !!!!  Think and understand.  ‚Åá

 Agarwal Sahab asked his servant Abdul- I have 2 children and I am worried about their future, but you have 12 and you are not worried yet.

  Abdullah - After 25 years, my 12 sons will take over your shop.  You only earn for us, then why should I care.  This is their state of mind.

  The great mansions built by the Hindus at Sialkot, Lahore, Gujranwala and Karanji were built for us.  Even in independent India, the Kashmiri Hindus in Kashmir have built great mansions for us and in the end we occupied them and we do not have to worry about you.

When i heard this statement, i just felt that the Tiger which was cadged for 70 years, he opened the cage door

This may be not so important statement for you but or me it was a moment like Mahabharat when the cloud moved and sun started shining, which lead to Jaidhrath Vadh

This statement is all about NEW BHARAT

BHARAT has arrived. It has its own mind now. We reject to be slave of world power. 

This one statement of Jaishanker shattered all hope of LeLi and congress who want US to punish us. The frustration on LeLi face is visiable

Human Right is the trump card always used against India, not anymore

The voilance you see is nothing but frustration of Congress as they fail in all their tricks. This never happened before

After the Modi-Biden virtual summit, Dr Jaishankar set the internet on fire when he answered a question on India‚Äôs oil imports from Russia.

‚ÄòIndia‚Äôs total oil purchase from Russia in a month is probably less than what Europe does in an afternoon‚Äô

And, he sustained his lethal grip...

‚Äò...for our ties to grow, it is equally important that there is a better understanding of India on the part of young Americans; your appreciation of a #Civilisationalstate and a fellow democratic polity overcoming daily odds is essential. After all, we are natural partners only when our people have a strong connect. And we, Secretary Blinken and I, are pleased to launch the working group on education and skill development...it will enable us to explore a range of opportunities that exist in the field of education, research, innovation and entrepreneurship...‚Äô

Reason for this ban: University of Hiroshima's scientists researched and found that ""radio waves"" from microwave ovens cause greater harm to health over the last 20 yrs, than the US atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Sep 1945.

Experts found that food heated in  microwave ovens has very unhealthy vibrations and radiation.

All the factories of ""microwave ovens"" in Japan are being closed. 

S Korea announced plans to close all ""microwave ovens"" factories by 2021, and China by 2023.

A conference on cancer prevention held @ Kashira Cancer Center recommended:
1. No Refined oil
2. No Milk of animal origin (recommended soya milk)
3. No Food cubes (chicken broth spices like Maggie etc)
4. No Soda (32 pieces of sugar per liter)
5. No Refined sugar
6. No Microwave ovens
7. No mammogram before birth, except echocardiography
8. No Very narrow underwear and bra
10. Do not re-freeze thawed food. 
11. Do not drink chilled water kept in plastic bottles stored in the fridge. 
12. Avoid  deodorants used after shaving or baths because they cause cancer.

The conference advise adding these to your diet :
1. Vegetables
2. Honey moderately used instead of sugar
3. Plant proteins (beans instead of meat)
4. 2 cups of water at body temp on  empty stomach before brushing teeth
5. Food should be warm and not very hot
6. Aloe vera juice + ginger + parsley + celery + bromalin (Mix and drink on an empty stomach) 
7. Carrot juice daily
8. Tomato, garlic onion with meals

Note : The American Physicians Association found the causes of cancer:
1. Do not drink anything hot in plastic cups
2. Do not eat anything hot wrapped in paper or cardboard or in a plastic bag (eg fried potatoes)
3. Don't eat in plastic or microwave dishes

Note:
When plastic is exposed to heat, chemicals dat can cause 52  cancer types are released.

You must also avoid drinking all kinds of soft drinks such as ""Cola, Pepsi, Av, Fanta and all concentrated juices because cancer feeds on sugar. Eat fresh pineapples and avoid pineapple mix. Don't eat heavy food after 7pm. 

Drink more water in the morning and less in the evening. Do not take a horizontal position (lying down/sleep) immediately after eating."

  *Have you heard of ""Law 30"", ""Law 30 A"" ?????*
                                                      *Do you know what ""30A"" means?*
                    
  *Do not delay to know more ......*

  *30A* is a law enshrined in the Constitution
                                                                       *When Nehru first tried to incorporate this law into the Constitution, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel vehemently opposed it.*

  *Sardar Patel said, ""This law is a great betrayal of the Hindus, so if this Gurney Act is brought into the Constitution, I will resign from the Cabinet and the Congress Party ... then I will fight against this betrayal., Gurney Act, along with all Indians ... from the front.  . ""  ... ""*

  *Nehru had to kneel before Sardar Patel's determination ...*
                               * *Unfortunately .. I do not know how .. In a few months Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel died unexpectedly ...*

  *After Patel's death, Nehru incorporated this law into the Constitution.*

  *Let me tell you the features of 30 A.*

  *Under this Act - Hindus are not allowed to teach their ""Hindu religion"" among Hindus.  ""Law 30A"" does not give it permission or authority .... then Hindus should not teach Hindu Dharma in their own private colleges ... should not start colleges to teach Hinduism .... should not start Hindu schools to teach Hinduism.  The teaching of Hinduism in government schools or colleges is not permitted under Act 30A ...*.

  *But .. The strange thing is that with this (with 30A) there is another law that Nehru enacted in their constitution - ""Act 30"".  According to this ""Law 30"" Muslims can start and start Islamic religious schools for their religious education ..... Muslims can teach their religion .... Law 30 gives full authority and permission to Muslims to start their own 'Madrasa'.  .... and Article 30 of the Constitution gives Christians full authority and permission to set up their own religious schools and colleges and to teach and propagate their religion freely ... * !!*

  *Another legal aspect of this is that all the money and wealth of Hindu temples can be left to the will of the government .... All the money and other donations made by Hindu devotees in Hindu temples can be taken to the state treasury ..... ...*

  *At the same time donations and donations from Muslim and Christian mosques can be made entirely to the Christian-Muslim community .... This is how the features of this ""Law 30"" go ..*

   *So ""Law 30A"" and ""Law 30"" are blatant discrimination and blatant betrayal of Hindus.*

A distinguished Parsi judge of the Gujarat High Court, *Justice J B Pardiwala* made the following remarks in his recent judgement in Hardik Patel case on Reservations. 

Unfortunately our law makers are going to impeach him for this para. Let's see what he said in his judgement:

*""If I am asked by any one to name two things, which has destroyed this country or rather, has not allowed the country, to progress in the right direction, then the same is, (i) Reservation & (ii) Corruption. It is very shameful for any citizen of this country to ask for reservation after 65 years of independence. When our Constitution was framed, it was understood that the reservation would remain for a period of 10 years, but unfortunately, it has continued even after 65 years of independence. The biggest threats, today, for the country is corruption. The countrymen should rise & fight against corruption at all levels, rather than shedding blood & indulging in violence for the reservation. The reservation has only played the role of an amoeboid monster sowing seeds of discord amongst the people. The importance of merit, in any society, cannot be understated.*

One has to wonder why is he going to be impeached by MPs (mostly Congress MPs).

*I fully & whole heartedly support the view of the Hon'ble Justice J B Pardiwala*. 

(The MPs who signed the ""impeachment of the Judge"" petition include Anand Sharma, Digvijay Singh, Ashwani Kumar, P L Punia, Rajeev Shukla, Oscar Fernandes, Ambika Soni, B K Hariprasad (all Congress), D Raja (CPI), K N Balagopal (CPI-M), Sharad Yadav (JD-U), S C Misra and Narinder Kumar Kashyap (BSP), Tiruchi Siva (DMK) and D P Tripathi (NCP)).

You must have heard the name 'Switzerland'.

A country where every married couple in the world dreams of celebrating their honeymoon.

This country covered with snowy valleys is an amazing masterpiece of beauty. Whether it is greenery or snow, wherever the eyes go, they remain wide open in wonder.

Switzerland is the richest country in the world! 

Telling you an interesting story of this country which is rich in every way.

About 50 years ago, a private bank was established in Switzerland named *'Swissbank'*.

This bank rules were different from other banks in the world.

This Swissbank used to charge its customers money in exchange for safe keeping their money, its maintenance and privacy.

They guaranteed privacy. Never asked customer where did the money come from? No question, no obligation.

This bank's reputation had spread worldwide over the year. Swiss Bank had become the first choice of thieves, dishonest leaders, mafia, smugglers and big businessmen.

The bank had only one rule.

Just like a recharge card, a number is given to the account holder, and a password is set.

Bank knew only 'that person who had that number'.

No other details were asked about the customer or his antecedents.

But

There was a rule of the bank that if there was no transaction for seven years or the account was not used for seven years, the bank will seize the account and deposit the money with the authorities.

Money accumulated in the Swissbank, where no transaction had occured for seven years, had piled up.

Don't know how many mafia are killed every day in the world. Leaders are caught and prosecuted. How many smugglers are caught or killed, how many get life imprisonment.

In such a situation, I don't know how many accounts were seized in the bank.

Bank opened such accounts on the occasion of the new century of 2000.

So all the unaccounted black money they got was equal to 40% of the whole world's black money.

Almost half of the whole world's black money.

This amount was even beyond  their imagination.

Even the bank was not able to decipher what to do with this amount. 

They kept thinking what to do with this enormous wealth?

Thinking about this, the bank made an announcement and
sought opinion from all the citizens of Switzerland, as what to do with this amount.

And the bank declared that If the citizens of the country so desired, the bank can distribute this amount to each of them. And each citizen will get a million Euros.

In the 15-day survey by the government, 99.2% of the people had an opinion that the amount should be spent in enhancing the beauty of the country and towards tourism development and offering comforts to foreign tourists.

Survey results may be shocking for us, Indians!

But it was a very simple decision for patriotic Switzerland public.

They rejected the *haram* money. This was a clear survey to say that ""we don't want freebies"".

Not only did they refuse free money, but on 25 January 2000, the people of Switzerland were standing outside the government survey channel with banners demanding that 0.8% of the people who wanted free money, the bank make their names public.

This they considered a stigma on society and Switzerland.

After a lot of assurances by the government to punish those who wanted free monies, the public calmed down.

And here, we want everything to be given free in India. Even when given free, we do not keep it safe. Apart from this, the sense of entitlement, tax thefts, electricity thefts, laziness to work, government jobs with no accountability, lack of civic sense, absence of duty towards one's country, corrupt politicians etc. are the major factors which are derailing development in the country."
1,017,676	"*The Year was 1959, the place was Amritsar. Some Indian Army Officers and their wives went to Railway Station to see off one of their colleagues. Some goons made lewd remarks against the women and tried  to molest them. The Army Officers chased the goons who took shelter in a nearby Cinema Theatre.*

_The matter had been reported to Commanding Officer Col Jyothi Mohan Sen. On learning about the incident, the Col ordered the Cinema Hall to be surrounded by troops. All the goons were dragged out and the leader of the goons was so heady and drunk with power; who was none other than the son of  Chief Minister of Punjab, Pratap Singh Kairon, the close associate of the then Prime Minister, Jawahar Lal Nehru._

_All the goons were stripped to their underwear's, paraded in the streets of Amritsar and later interned in the Cantonment. Next day, the Chief Minister became furious and tried to release his son from Indian Army's incarceration._

You know what happened ?

*_His vehicle was not allowed to go in to the Cantonment as VIP Vehicle, he was compelled to walk all the way to meet the Colonel. The infuriated Chief Minister, Kairon complained about the whole affair to Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru._*

Those days were different, democracy was in nascent stage, leaders though powerful had  some qualms and ethics. 

_The perplexed, the so called Bharat Ratna Prime Minister Nehru instead of questioning his confidante Pratap Singh Kairon, sought explanation from the Army Chief General Thimmayya for the conduct of his Officers._

You know what Thimmayya replied?

*""If we can not defend the honour of our women, how can you expect us to defend the honour of our Country ?""*

Nehru was dumbfounded. That was the Story of a brave Soldier who defied the Prime Minister.

*Kimani Wamatangi; dead or alive? British court seeks answers from Kenyan Government*
 
Two British investigators have moved to court seeking the deportation of Kiambu Senator and UDA‚Äôs gubernatorial candidate Kimani Wamatangi over a multi-billion fraud that took place in Europe between 2009 and 2012.

According to court documents seen by this writer, the Kiambu Senator was the ring leader of a car importation syndicate that sold luxury cars stolen from Luton, Cheshire, Berkshire, London, and Oxfordshire, among other cities in the UK.

However, the lawmaker dodged authorities in the UK and Kenya by traveling on passports with several aliases throwing off investigators. 

According to a case filed at Luton Crown Court, investigators have since established that Wamatangi sneaked back to Kenya in late 2009 and went into hiding.

The investigations lead by a security team drawn from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), and the UK‚Äôs National Crime Agency was thrown off track after the cunning legislator faked his death.

Court documents show that Kimani Wamatangi ‚Äòdied‚Äô sometime in October 2008 and a Death and Funeral Announcement (obituary) was placed in two leading Kenyan newspapers i.e. the Nation and the Standard.

This prompted the Interpol, through the British High Commission to dispatch a team of detectives to Wamatangi‚Äôs ‚Äòmatrimonial home‚Äô, where his sister showed them his final resting place, complete with a cross engraved with his last known alias ‚ÄòPaul Kimani‚Äô.

The name and date of death corresponded with the newspaper obituaries prompting Interpol to close the file. 

A postmortem report filed at the Luton Court further reveals that Wamatangi reportedly ‚Äòdied‚Äô from a heart attack caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis, (TB).

The investigators reopened this file in May 2021 after a Kenyan wrote to Interpol, informing them that the ‚Äòlate‚Äô Paul Kimani who was wanted for theft and fraud in the UK was alive and is now a ‚Äòrespected Kenyan politician seeking to be Governor in one of the counties.

In an affidavit, the informer further revealed that Mr. Paul Kimani had changed his name to ‚ÄòKimani Wamatangi‚Äô and he was residing at a city hotel since faking his death fearing that the people he swindled tens of millions in Europe and Asia would come for him.

He further revealed that Wamatangi hails from Gathiga in Kabete and not Limuru Constituency where his ‚Äògrave‚Äô is located.

‚ÄúThe grave in Limuru is empty, everything about Kimani Wamatangi is a fraud including his home. He has no known physical residence in Kiambu or Nairobi and he lives in exclusive hotels away from the public eye‚Äù, the affidavit states in part.

In another document, investigators detailed how Wamatangi shipped stolen high-end market vehicles that he sold to unsuspecting Kenyans at his Mombasa Road car bazaar. 

He would later tip off corrupt DCI officers who would way lay the unsuspecting buyers, forcing them to spend millions of shillings in buying their freedom.

Luton Court is expected to issue a warrant of arrest anytime and Paul Wamatangi will be extradited to face criminal charges in the UK. 

Wamatangi will become the first Kenyan politician to be extradited to face fraud-related charges in the UK."

Anahita Pandole, a top doctor at Breach Candy Hospital, (who was driving the car) and Darius Pandole, the managing director and CEO of JM Financial Private Equity were in the front seat wearing seat belts. They survived but with injuries and have been shifted to a hospital.

In the rear seat without wearing seat belt were Cyrus Mistry and Jahangir Binshah Pandole (brother of Darius Pandole), both of whom died on the spot.

Airbags are of no use if seat belt is not strapped....that is the first line of defence...Air bag is the second line of defence only if the first is complied. If you do not lock seat belt properly Air bag will not open

All the cars have rear seat belts as per government regulation, but very few people use them, it is an illusion that the rear is very safe. 

During the time of crash the person behind is sometimes thrown at a force of 40G (40 times the gravity, which means the person weighing 80kgs will be like 3200kgs). 

If the front passenger is wearing seat belt and rear passenger is not, during the time of crash, the front passenger is likely to be severely injured (or even killed) due to the rear passenger falling with a weight of an elephant. The rear passenger however has no chance of survival.

Indians are a strange lot and have very little respect for seat belts (or helmets in two wheelers). However they will give a thousand reasons for not using these safety devices.  You are paying for seat belts - why not use them and be safe. 

Pl forward to your friends and loved ones, it can save their life.

1,552,553	"International news, the epidemic has become serious again in the United States, so experts want everyone to know the following two things!
1) Omicron has no immunity, if you get it, you will get it again.
2) There is no so-called coexistence of this virus. The original experts said that coexistence is wrong!
So please pay attention to this matter and strengthen epidemic prevention, because the changes of the virus after entering the human body are unpredictable!
The virus has mutated, the vaccine has not been updated, and it has lost its protective effect. Therefore, three doses will be the same as the diagnosis, severe disease and death. Protect yourself, do not get infected, and you will have a healthy body.
There's really no way out
all over the world
Just take precautions
No fluke!

Be sure to wear a mask because the new COVID-Omicron BA4, an extended variant of BA5 coronavirus is different, deadly and not easily detected correctly:-

Symptoms of the new COVID-Omicron BA4 BA5 extension virus are as follows:-

    1. Do not cough.
    2. No fever.

  There will only be:-

    3. Joint pain.
    4. Headache.
    5. Neck pain.
    6. Upper back pain.
    7. Pneumonia.

    8. In general, no appetite

  Of course, the COVID-Omicron BA is 5 times more virulent than the Delta variant and has a higher mortality rate than the Delta.

 It takes a short time for the disease to progress to extreme severity, sometimes with no obvious symptoms.

 Let's be more careful!

 The virus strain does not deposit in the nasopharynx. It directly affects the lungs, the ""window,"" and is shorter in duration.

Several patients diagnosed with Covid Omicron were eventually diagnosed with no fever or pain, but mild chest pneumonia was found on X-rays.

 Nasal swab tests for COVID-Omicron are often negative, with an increasing number of false-negative nasopharyngeal tests.

 This means that the virus can spread in the community, directly infecting the lungs, causing viral pneumonia, which in turn causes acute respiratory stress.

 This explains why Covid-Omicron has become very harmful, the virus is very virulent and has a high fatality rate.

 Please note, avoid crowded places, keep a distance of 1.5m even in open spaces, wear a double-layer mask, wear a suitable mask, and wash your hands frequently when you have no symptoms (coughing or sneezing) .

  This Covid Omicron *""WAVE""* is deadlier than the first wave of Covid-19. So we have to be very careful and take *various measures to strengthen prevention against coronavirus*.

 Don't keep this information to yourself, share it with other family and friends as much as possible, especially family and close friends"

 Everyone is advised to wear a mask because the new COVID-Omicron XBB variant coronavirus is different, deadly and not easily detected properly:-

   Symptoms of the novel COVID-Omicron XBB virus are as follows:-

     1. Do not cough.
     2. No fever.

     There will only be many :-

     3. Joint pain.
     4. Headache.
     5. Neck pain.

     7. Pneumonia.
     8. Generally have no appetite.

   Of course, the COVID-Omicron XBB is 5 times more toxic than the Delta variant and has a higher mortality rate than the Delta.

   It takes a shorter time for the condition to reach extreme severity, and sometimes there are no obvious symptoms.

    Let's be more careful!

   This strain of the virus is not found in the nasopharyngeal region, and it directly affects the lungs, the ""windows,"" for a relatively short period of time.

   Several patients diagnosed with Covid Omicron XBB were eventually classified as having no fever and no pain, but X-rays showed mild chest pneumonia.

   Nasal swab tests are generally negative for COVID-Omicron XBB, and false-negative cases of nasopharyngeal tests are increasing.

   This means that the virus can spread in the community and directly infect the lungs, leading to viral pneumonia, which in turn causes acute respiratory stress.

   This explains why Covid-Omicron XBB has become highly contagious, highly virulent and lethal.

   Please note, avoid crowded places, keep a distance of 1.5m even in open spaces, wear a double-layer mask, wear a suitable mask, wash your hands frequently when everyone is asymptomatic (no coughing or sneezing)  .

    This Covid Omicron *""WAVE""* is deadlier than the first wave of Covid-19.  So we have to be very careful and take various enhanced coronavirus precautions.

Comment.*------+--+-++++++--++---------------------------------+++++++++++++++++++++++++++*NDIAN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER DR. JAISHANKAR  WAS  SOMEWHAT SHOCKED AND PUZZLED  TO HEAR THE STATEMENT FROM THE  U.S. SECRETRY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN ABOUT THE MINORITY PERSECUTION IN INDIA FOR THE FIRST TIME*

Dr. Jaishankar  is trying to shine forth  through his talks without proper reference to any reality.    

He made a statement that he has a view of the American persecution.   Can you explain your view?

Mr. External Affairs Minister,  1% of the U.S. population  are Hindus,  the fourth religious population,  Christians-Jews-Muslims and Hindus.   The U.S. population is 335 million.   That is the 8th largest Hindu population in the world according to the PEW research.

The largest percentage of Hindus are in the State of New Jersey, 3%.   2%  in California and Delaware,  1% average in the rest of the States.   They  have the highest income ratio in the nation.   There are hundreds of Hindu Temples nationwide.

The first generation of Hindus were migrated,  the 2nd and the rest of the generation are born here.   The Indian Christians were not migrated,  their roots are 2000 years.

Can you tell,  how many Hindus were attacked in the U.S.?   How many Hindu Temples were attacked in the U.S.?   Why the Hindus are trying everything to migrate to a Christian majority nation from the paradise of Hinduism under the BJP rule led by PM Modi??

Do you know Mr. Jaishankar,   in 10 States of India,  there is anti-conversion law specifically targeting the Christians.   Can you show any such law anywhere in the U.S.?   That is the number one violation of human right.

Among the 50 nations where the Christians are persecuted for their faith,  India ranks at the 10th place.   

Do you know the attacks against the Christians in India since your BJP rule came into exitance in 2014?

You were educated at the famous St. Stephens College at New Delhi.  That is a very well known Christian college of India.   Rev. C. F. Andrews,  the Professor of Philosophy was the mentor of Mahatma Gandhi.   Have you ever been forced to covert to the Christian faith while you were a student there?   Why did you and your parents  show  greater interest  for you  to study in a Christian College?

If you can't answer to these questions,  then your logic has no validity. Is it not wonderful punch?"
1,809,490	"Another good decision by the Modi government on the suggestion of Superstar Akshay Kumar :* ........
* Daily payment of only one rupee, that too for the Indian Army. In the cabinet meeting yesterday, the Modi government opened a bank account for the modernity of the Indian Army and for the soldiers who are injured or martyred in the war zone. In which every Indian can donate any amount on his own free will. Which starts from Rs.1 and is unlimited.*

* This money will also be used to buy weapons for the army and paramilitary forces. Taking a final decision on today's burning situation on Mann Ki Baat and suggestions of people on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Modi government has opened Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualty Fund account in New Delhi, *Canara Bank.*

* This is the master stroke of Film Star Akshay Kumar. From where no one can stop India from becoming a super power. If even 70% of India's 130 crore population puts only one rupee daily in this fund, then that one rupee will be 100 crores in a day. 3000 crores in 30 days and 36000 crores in a year. 36,000 crores is not even the annual defense budget of Pakistan. We spend 100 or 1000 rupees daily in useless work, but if we give one rupee for the army, India will definitely become a super power.

* Your money will be directly deposited in the Defense Ministry's Army Assistance and War Casualty Fund. Which will be useful for military material and army personnel.

*That's why help the army directly by joining this campaign of Modiji.*
  Nothing will happen by doing hi hi kar Pakistan, blocking roads and making rhetoric. Implement the thinking of Modi and the people of the country and strengthen the army of our country.

Please be careful.. There is a HIGH TECHNOLOGY SCAM going on at this time called *SIM SWAP FRAUD*, it is said that hundreds of people have been affected, they suddenly found that their bank accounts were *EMPTY*

  How does it work?

 1) The new scam called SIM SWAP starts like this... Your phone network will suddenly go blank / zero (No Signal / Zero Bar) and after a while, you will get a call.

 2)The caller will tell you that he is calling from (your mobile phone company) depending on your network and that there is a problem in your mobile network.

 3)He will instruct you to Please press 1 on your phone to regain network.  - *PLEASE*... at this stage
  don't Press anything, Just hang up or *END* the call.  If you press 4) the network will appear suddenly and in a moment *your HP Will go blank again (Zero Bar) and with that action, your phone *ALREADY HACKED*.

  In a few seconds they will empty your bank account, and you won't receive any notification.. about it.
  It will appear as if your line has been disconnected with no Network, meanwhile your SIM has been *CHANGED*

  The danger here is, you won't get any transaction alerts.

  Let's be more careful.

  Please, extend this info to your contacts, loved ones and friends.  Fraud is increasing day by day.

  Remember: Starting tomorrow at 05:27, we will experience the APHELION event.  Earth is at a different distance from the Sun than normal.

 We cannot see this event, but we can feel its impact.  It will last till March.

  We may experience colder weather than usual.

  It can cause fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.
   We should strengthen our immune system by consuming foods that strengthen the lungs and heart.

  The distance from Earth to Sun is 5 light minutes ie 90,000,000 (9 crore) km.  Aphelion event takes us 152,000,000 (15.2 crore) km from the Sun or 66% of the distance.

 Therefore the humidity in the air will increase till the end of March instead of ending in the current month of February due to the south-west monsoon from last July and then the special north-east monsoon for our Tamil Nadu.

 Our body... especially those who feel difficulty in breathing,,
 Older people.. will see a big difference with this coolness.

 So we have to keep our health balanced, whether it's cloudy or sunny, the body still feels cold!!!

 And winter can cause feelings of lethargy even in healthy people.

 Therefore, appropriate changes should be made from the way you dress to the food you eat.
  
 To protect our health... Please share this information with everyone as possible especially family friends who are elderly.  So they might as well be forewarned."

A letter written by Rahul Gandhi to Mahatma Gandhi's great grandson...

In which it was said by Rahul Gandhi that... RSS itself had killed Gandhiji, so that he would come to support Congress against BJP.

In response to this, Gandhiji's great grandson Shrikrishna Gandhi wrote this open letter to Rahul Gandhi in response... which he also circulated in the public domain.

Dear Rahul Gandhi,

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhiji was my great-grandfather, he was assassinated by Shri Nathuram Godse, many inquiries and commissions researched the matter and none implicated RSS in the case of Gandhiji's assassination nor held RSS responsible.

My grandfather late  Ramdas Gandhi wrote to the then Home Minister Sardar Patel to release Shri Nathuram Godse from death sentence.

*For your information, let me tell you that... In 1969, when Ramdas Gandhi was leaving his body in Mumbai... Shri Nathuram Godse's younger brother Shri Gopal Godse had met him.*

*This issue is completely in the past and my family has moved on from that.*

My humble suggestion to your people... Those who wish Congress and your well being, go ahead... and stop using Gandhi's name and this issue for their selfishness.

*All of you... show generosity to accept the decisions of various commissions.*

*To keep saying all the time that RSS killed Gandhi... is like saying... that Sikhs killed your grandmother... when it is a lie...?  Because not all Sikhs were involved in this.* 

*You are not from Gandhi family.  Your family and you did the work of throwing dust in the eyes of this country for a long time by using the name of Gandhi in India... and fooled the country for seven-eight decades.*

*Your family misused my great-grandfather's surname under opportunistic policy... Now you stop using Gandhi's name while informing the country about your reality.*

*Gandhiji is not your grandfather, Firoz Khan is... He was the son of 'Nawab Khan', a Gujarati Pathan of Junagadh, Nawab Khan's wife was a Parsi who converted to Islam.*

*Your grandmother Indira ji was also a Muslim... because she converted to Islam to marry Firoz Khan.*

*You are a mixture of Muslim and Christian... There is neither an iota of Rahul in you... nor Gandhi.*

*You are not even remotely close to being a Hindu... rather you are just a combination of Muslim/Catholic DNA.*

*I am making this public because... so that... you can no longer deceive anyone from our real Gandhi family.  I hope... you will accept your real... religion / caste form leaving the support of my family name, and also you will stop throwing dust in the eyes of the country and show a big heart to apologize to the country.‚ò∫Ô∏è*

Narendra Modi's sole aim is to make India a better Country. If he is not stopped, in the future, India will become the most Powerful Nation in the World.. It will surprise even ¬†the USA, the United Kingdom, and Russia..Japan.

Narendra Modi is moving towards a specific goal. No one knows what he wants to do....and his intentions, strategy, cannot be predicted.

Behind the Smiling face, he is a dangerous Patriot. He uses all the Countries of the world for the benefit of his Nation......India.

First he destroyed US ties with Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Next Narendra Modi has created an alliance with Vietnam, shattered China‚Äôs Superpower dream and made use of the three Countries.

The long-running dispute over oil extraction overseas between Vietnam and China has benefited India. With India's support, Vietnam began producing Oil in China's Southern Seas.

Vietnam now supplies all of its Oil to India. The United States has different support for this. He made Pakistan a poor Country without going into a war.

He brought the Port of Iran under his control.

He has set up an Indian Military base on the border with Afghanistan, very close to the area that divides Pakistan.

In order to increase Indian trade, he has also built a route through Iran (leaving Pakistan) to Afghanistan.

Narendra Modi‚Äôs desires are going Up one by one. Sections 370 and 35A have been repealed.

One day he will completely capture Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Pakistan will fall into 4 pieces in the coming seasons. This will happen on the warning of Narendra Modi.

Saudi Arabia, Pakistan's traditional ally, will also play a Key role in the Partition of Pakistan..

In Asia, this man who finished China and the United States, has ¬†canceled the SAARC Summit and shown his power to the World.. Narendra Modi has succeeded in maintaining India's superiority over Asia..

He made UAE fine the Foreign minister of Pakistan on landing in UAE & sent the minister back. Malaysia took over a Pakistan airplane to recover debts owed by Pakistan.

Russia and Japan, 2 of Asia's Major Powers, have done nothing to say.

He held both Countries in his hands with great precision. In the case of China's Vietnam Oil issue, China will ask for Oil... Then he will ask Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. ü§ü

What he would ask was, ""I'll take it.. You have Hair in your Mouth,"" and tease China's Vietnam issue..

Nothing can be done by China. This person is taking Indian Politics to a totally different level.

Many Countries think and act as if each Country has many Enemies.. But India has no Enemies other than Pakistan. India is almost certain to be a friend to all Countries of the World.

This man is doing more harm to Pakistan than the real War.. By using Muslim Countries against Pakistan, Narendra Modi has proven himself to be one of the Best leaders in the World.

Even if Pakistan goes for War with India, there will not be so much loss.. But now Pakistan is suffering more than that.

In all negotiations with all Countries, this person's Honesty must be taken into account.

India's progress will be difficult for the rest of the World.

With the current astounding growth of India, all the Countries in the United Nations will experience the consequences..!

Experts found dat food heated in  microwave ovens has very unhealthy vibrations and radiation.

All the factories of ""Microwave Ovens"" in Japan are being closed. 

S. Korea announced plans to close all ""Microwave Ovens"" factories by 2021, and China by 2023.

A conference on cancer prevention held @ Kashira Cancer Center recommended :

12. Avoid  deodorants usually used after shaving or baths because they cause cancer.

The conference advise adding these to your diet :
1. Vegetables
2. Honey moderately used instead of sugar
3. Plant proteins (beans instead of meat)
4. 2 cups of water at body temp on empty stomach before brushing teeth
5. Food should be warm and not very hot
6. Aloe vera juice + ginger + parsley + celery + bromalin (Mix and drink on an empty stomach) 
7. Carrot juice daily
8. Tomato, garlic onion with meals.

Note : The American Physicians Association found the causes of cancer:
1. Do not drink anything hot in plastic cups
2. Do not eat anything hot wrapped in paper or cardboard or in a plastic bag (e.g. fried potatoes)
3. Don't eat in plastic or microwave dishes

Note:
When plastic is exposed to heat, chemicals that can cause 52 cancer types are released.

You must also avoid drinking all kinds of soft drinks such as ""Cola, Pepsi, Av, Fanta and all concentrated juices because cancer feeds on sugar. Eat fresh pineapples n avoid pineapple mix. Don't eat heavy food after 7pm. 

Drink more water in the morning and less in the evening. Do not take a horizontal position (lying down/sleep) immediately after eating.

    Hot pineapple kills cancer cells.
    Thinly slice 2 to 3 pieces of pineapple in a cup and add hot water, it will be ""alkaline water"", if you drink it daily, it is good for everyone.
    Hot pineapple releases anti-cancer substances, the latest advancement in medicine for effective cancer treatment.
    The warm fruit of pineapple has the effect of killing cysts and tumors.  It has been proven to cure all types of cancer.
    Pineapple hot water clears all the germs and toxins from the body due to allergies/allergies.
    A drug derived from pineapple juice only destroys *violent cells* and does not affect healthy cells.
    Also, the amino acids and pineapple polyphenols in pineapple juice can control high blood pressure, prevent blockage of internal blood vessels, improve blood circulation and reduce blood clotting.

  If *Christians* continue to sell their vote or divide votes or not vote India will be declared a Hindu nation.

  The only way to prevent this is to let the BJP loose by voting for the Congress party's strongest candidate.

  But every Christian denomination should unite and decide to vote for Congress to defeat BJP.

  Christians who are selling their votes, are really selling Christianity.

  The same goes for the division of votes.

  So the upcoming elections are not just about elections, *it is about the existence of Christians and other minorities and our freedom to practice religion.*

1,915,180	"I read this incident about Arun Lal. Some of you must have also read it. It is so fascinating that I feel like sharing with all of you again . 
As you know, Arun Lal was an Indian cricketer who opened the innings with Gavaskar. Later, he was diagnosed with rare jaw cancer and was operated. He recovered, bounced back, and became a TV commentator, and later a coach. 

It was four decades ago when cricketer Arun Lal moved from Delhi to Kolkata and became a Bong. Around the same time the right-handed batsman was playing for the Indian national team, the young son of the local dhobi, Bikash, would come to his house along with his father every day, and Lal's wife Debjani would tutor him in English.
A relationship thus started with English  coaching.  Lals, who don‚Äôt have kids, took Bikash Chowdhury under their wing, and guided and helped him in his education. Bikash splitting his time between the Lal home and his father‚Äôs pavement dwelling in Bhawanipore, went on to study in an English medium school, Courtesy Lal‚Äôs, did BCom and MCom. Then he appeared for the CAT. In 2000, got into IIM Kolkata. Jobs with Deutsche Bank and Credit Agricole followed, including a stint in London for DB. Bikash Chowdhury, 41, is now the associate vice president of treasury at JSW Steel, and based in Mumbai. The amazing rags-to-riches story of the boy who grew up on the footpath in Kolkata and then cracked one of India's toughest colleges to become a corporate honcho is inspiring.
On his part, Bikash has generously and openly expressed his gratitude to the Lals. 
Very recently, Bikash Chowdhury has gifted his mentor a Mercedes, while he himself drives a Volkswagen Vento and Renault Duster. He also financially aided the Lal family when they wanted to move from an apartment into a bungalow. As the ultimate tribute, Bikash and his wife named their daughter Arunima after Arun. ""We gained a son. He is a terrific human being and I am grateful to the Lord for Bikash,"" said Arun Lal.
     Truely fascinating."

""Modi ji, there is no point in shouting standing on a stage and asking the  question what is achieved in the last 60 years. Don't you think that the citizens of our country are fools. You are the Prime Minister of a country ,  which was under the  British rule for more than 300 years. The people were living just like slaves. Congress came to power in 1947 after independence and has started with zero. There was nothing in this country except the garbage left out by the British. India didn't even have the resources to produce even a pin since Britishers left India. The electricity was available only for 20 villages across the country. Telephone facility was available only for 20 rulers (kings) in this country. There was no drinking water supply. There were  only 10 small dams. No hospitals, no educational institutions, No fertilisers, no feed, no water supply for cultivation. There were no jobs & only starvation could be seen across the country. There were many infant deaths. Very few military staff on the border. Only 4 planes, 20 tanks  & fully open borders on all 4 sides of the country. Very minimum roads & bridges. Empty exchequer. 
Nehru came to power in these circumstances.
What is India after 60 years ?
One of the World's largest army. Thousands of war planes, tanks. Lakhs of industrial institutions. Electricity in almost all villages. Hundreds of electic power stations. Lakhs of kilometers of national highways & over bridges. New railway projects, Stadiums, super speciality hospitals, most of the Indian households with television, telephone for all the countrymen. All infrastructure to work in and outside the country, Banks, Universities, AIIMS, IITs, IIMs, Nuclear weapons, sub-marines, nuclear stations, ISRO, Navratna Public sector units.
Indian Army barging till Lahore years back... Split Pakistan into 2 pieces . 1 lakh of military & commanders of Pakistan surrendered to Indian army .
India started exporting minerals & food items . Bank nationalization by Mrs. Indira Gandhi .  Computers introduced to India & many job opportunities in India and outside the country . 
You have become PM using information technology. 
When you took over as the PM, India was in the top 10 economies in the world . Apart from this, GSLV, Mangalyaan, Monorail, Metro rail, International airports, Prithvi, Agni, Naag, Nuclear submarines.... all these were achieved well before you became PM.
Please do not come to people shouting and asking what congress has achieved in 60 years.
Please tell people what you have achieved in the last 6 ¬Ω years , except changing names, installing a statue and constantly playing cow politics, creating a rift between Hindus and Muslims, Hindus and Christians, Hindus and Dalits, Hindus and other minorities, 
your failed demonetisation, poorly executed GST ( lowest since we achieved independence) and making people stand in long queues, causing unnecessary deaths. Hypocrite BJPians opposed FDI like anything and now BJP is supporting FDI shamelessly.. BJP is selling India to Ambani and Adani and Rafale deal to Anil Ambani's 2-month old company over HAL owned by government of India is a prime example of it.. BJP made petrol, diesel, and LPG price go up by putting more tax, while the price of crude oil became cheaper.. Modi government has  through SBI in the form of fine collected whopping Rs 1771 crore for not able to maintain minimum balance from the poor people of India. Vikas is happening for Amit Shah's son , Shaurya Doval, Ambanis, Adani, Baba Ramdev's Patanjali group, and the people who sponsor  BJP.. 3000 crores have been spent by BJP to clean river Ganga, the  corruption of which, each and everyone can find out by taking a dip in river Ganga..you come out with sewage, scum, grease all over your body.

*Do you know about our former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram lived with his wife in the house owned by his wife... And claimed its rent¬† from the govt every month for 10 years?*

*And the rental amount was 20 lakhs per month!!!*

*Do you know why a new secretariat called 'VISTA' is being built in New Delhi at an estimated cost of 975 Crores?*

*Read on. There are 30 to 40¬† secretariats in New Delhi belonging to the various ministries. All of them are situated in rented accommodations.* 

*The rental value of EACH Secretariat is a whopping 20-25 CRORES!! And most of these buildings are owned by either Congress leaders or the anti national  Communist Fellows!!!* 

*You can calculate the total rent of all these buildings which is regularly being paid to these 'owners', thus draining out around 500 crores every year !!!!*

*This, exactly, is the reason that the central govt plans to shift all these Secretariats to one huge complex called VISTA. Apart from saving the huge rental expenditure on the exchequer, it saves on logistics for files and personnel to move from one secretariat to another on duty. Saves movement time too!*

*As you can see the entire cost of construction of the new VISTA Complex would be recovered in just TWO years' period.*

*The proposed complex is strongly opposed by the Congress & Communist leaders because they would lose the easy money which the central govt was paying them towards rent. Hence they filed their objections in the Supreme Court !!!*

*But the Supreme Court was wise enough to understand the logic and dismissed the appeal as superfluous and untenable, also imposing a fine of One lakh rupees on them and warning those who indulged in such superfluous appeals.*

*Joseph Hope, Editor-in-Chief of the New York Times:*

Narendra Modi's sole aim is to make India a better Country. If he is not stopped, in the future, India will become the most Powerful Nation in the World.. It will surprise even  the USA, the United Kingdom, and Russia..Japan.

Narendra Modi is moving towards a specific goal. No one knows what he wants to do....and his intentions, strategy, cannot be predicted.

Behind the Smiling face, he is a dangerous Patriot. He uses all the Countries of the world for the benefit of his Nation......India.

First he destroyed US ties with Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Next Narendra Modi has created an alliance with Vietnam, shattered China‚Äôs Superpower dream and made use of the three Countries.
 
The long-running dispute over oil extraction overseas between Vietnam and China has benefited India. With India's support, Vietnam began producing Oil in China's Southern Seas.

Vietnam now supplies all of its Oil to India. The United States has different support for this. He made Pakistan a poor Country without going into a war.

He brought the Port of Iran under his control.

He has set up an Indian Military base on the border with Afghanistan, very close to the area that divides Pakistan.

In order to increase Indian trade, he has also built a route through Iran (leaving Pakistan) to Afghanistan.

Narendra Modi‚Äôs desires are going Up one by one. Sections 370 and 35A have been repealed.

One day he will completely capture Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Pakistan will fall into 4 pieces in the coming seasons. This will happen on the warning of Narendra Modi.

Saudi Arabia, Pakistan's traditional ally, will also play a Key role in the Partition of Pakistan..

In Asia, this man who finished China and the United States, has  canceled the SAARC Summit and shown his power to the World.. Narendra Modi has succeeded in maintaining India's superiority over Asia..

He made UAE fine the Foreign minister of Pakistan on landing in UAE & sent the minister back. Malaysia took over a Pakistan airplane to recover debts owed by Pakistan.

Russia and Japan, 2 of Asia's Major Powers, have done nothing to say.

He held both Countries in his hands with great precision. In the case of China's Vietnam Oil issue, China will ask for Oil... Then he will ask Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. ü§ü

What he would ask was, ""I'll take it.. You have Hair in your Mouth,"" and tease China's Vietnam issue..

Nothing can be done by China. This person is taking Indian Politics to a totally different level.

Many Countries think and act as if each Country has many Enemies.. But India has no Enemies other than Pakistan. India is almost certain to be a friend to all Countries of the World.

This man is doing more harm to Pakistan than the real War.. By using Muslim Countries against Pakistan, Narendra Modi has proven himself to be one of the Best leaders in the World.
 
Even if Pakistan goes for War with India, there will not be so much loss.. But now Pakistan is suffering more than that.

In all negotiations with all Countries, this person's Honesty must be taken into account.

India's progress will be difficult for the rest of the World.

With the current astounding growth of India, all the Countries in the United Nations will experience the consequences..!

‚úì1. On 15/Oct/1947 when Pakistan and Afghanistan Pathans attack India, the whole sleeping brave GURKHA company was murdered by fellow Muslim brother soldiers of own Battalion. Company commander Prem Singh was the first to become victim. 2 Gurkha JCO's with 30 other ranks manage to escape and fled to Jhangar to report the incident. Next day Major Nasarullah Khan led the Muslim troops to Tharochhi fort where the Garrison, blissfully recieved them. Unaware of the development of night before and what was to befall them soon. At night, the unsuspecting Gorkhas were all murdered in a ghastly repeat performance. Their commander captain Raghubeer Singh Thapa was ""torchered to death"". P.M. Nehru suppressed the matter. It's all mentioned in the book ""The Military Plight of Pakistan""
‚úì2. Another big thing that was hidden by Nehru during  1947 war with Pakistan was that many of the Muslims laid down their weapons & joined the Pakistan under the British major John Bird to fight the Indians but in the latter stage the British major was suspended & was immediately lifted to England on the next ship. Late Sardar Patel wanted to make it public but was ordered not to do so by Gandhi.
‚úì3. During 1965 Indo-Pak war Muslim regiment of 30,000 Indian soldiers not only denied to fight with Pakistan but went to Pakistan with weapons to support them. It put India in big trouble as they over trusted them. Lal Bahadur Shastri before being poisioned abolished Muslim regiment.

1,957,961	"*Why Separate Administration is the Right Solution in Manipur?*

_By LS Kipgen_
_New Delhi: June 2, 2023_

On 3 May 3 2023, at 4 pm when the ‚ÄòTribal Solidarity March‚Äô organised by the All Tribal Students‚Äô Union Manipur (ATSUM) in all the hill districts of Manipur against the Meitei‚Äôs demand for inclusion in the list of Scheduled Tribes ended peacefully, the tribal students in Churachandpur got provoked by the news that certain Meitei miscreant youths came from the neighbouring Bishnupur district and had set on fire the Anglo-Kuki War Centenary Gate at Leisang, a village located within Churachandpur along the district highway closed to the district boundary with Bishnupur.

On reaching the spot, the Kuki youths found a Meitei journalist recording the burning flame of tyres at the right foot of the gate‚Äôs column. As they learned the perpetrators, who came in a white bolero vehicle, had returned to Bishnupur, the pursuing Kuki youths moved to the next mixed settled village, Torbung, where a group of Meiteis had already gathered on the road. Amid the commotion, the Kuki youths raised the issue and tried to resolve it amicably, but the Meitei youths resorted to violence and led the first assault as they began pelting stones and then torching Kuki villages in Kangvai, a village adjoining Torbung.

The retaliation resulted in a communal clash that spread like wildfire to the Imphal valley. By nightfall, the dominant Meitei community had started unleashing genocide attack upon the Kukis in the capital city of Imphal where thousands of Kuki homes were vandalised, looted, and set on fire, including churches, while the state government remained a mute spectator. A targeted killing spree went on in the midst of an anarchic capital city. Two Kuki young girls at Palace Gate, a stone‚Äôs throw away from the Chief Minister‚Äôs bungalow, were handed over by their landlord into the hands of Meitei miscreants, who mercilessly gang raped and then murdered them. Their dead bodies are still lying at the RIMS hospital mortuary.

The tone and abusive language (such as haothu hatlo) used as well as the beastly attack on fellow human beings as seen and heard from the viral video clips on social media are sickening and unbelievable as they appear like a nightmare worse than can be imagined, more so when all these attacks are taking place within a one kilometre radius from the Chief Minister‚Äôs bungalow. The unprecedented violence of such scale could have been prevented had the CM, N. Biren Singh, taken precautionary measures, or at least the damage to properties and casualties could have been less disastrous had the state timely intervened. But the state-sponsored genocide was let loose for the maximum possible catastrophe.

A series of actions, notifications and press briefings of the state government put together in proper sequence reveals direct involvement of the state in the ethnic crisis with the sole motive of ensuring the majority community Meitei takeover possession of the tribal hills through three deliberated means: (i) by getting ST recognition, (ii) by eviction of tribal villages in the garb of Reserved or Protected Forest, which may later be used for settlement; and (iii) by unleashing communal violence to drive the minority tribals out of their land. The sequence of preparation may be highlighted as follows:

*Meitei‚Äôs demand for ST recognition*
The Meitei community, led by the Scheduled Tribes Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM), which has been demanding ST status since 2012 had filed an appeal before the High Court of Manipur pleading that granting them ST status will ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù the community and ‚Äúsave the ancestral land, tradition, culture, and language‚Äù. They also argued that the Meitei community was recognised as a tribe before the merger of the princely state of Manipur with the Union of India in 1949. The truth, however, is that ST recognition comes with the constitution of India, which was adopted only in 1950, and there was no ST recognition before it.

 Some of the provisions in the Indian Motor Vehicle Act are *Unclear*.  People are NOT aware of certain rules.

Thus; a Car Owner has been punished under the Indian Motor Vehicle Act for ‚Äòminor assistance‚Äô made unknowingly as doing an illegal act.

 *Read what happened with Nitin Nair from Mumbai*

On the morning of the 18th of last month in Tangar, he was on his way to the office.  It was raining then.  Some buses were overcrowded.  Some buses arrived very late. Thus those who had to go to the office urgently were asking for a ‚Äòlift‚Äô.  

So in the area called Airoli Circle, 3 people asked Nitin Nair for a ‚Äòlift‚Äô.  One of them was an old man in his 60s and two other worked in a reputed IT company.  They had to go to an area called Gandhi Nagar.  Nitin Nair had to cross Gandhi Nagar to go to his office. Nitin Nair, thus understanding their situation, generously loaded the trio into his car.  

A police officer stopped the car shortly after.  Who were the traveling powers?  Nitin Nair told the police officer what happened.

The police officer immediately confiscated Nitin Nair's license and handed over a receipt for the fine to Nitin Nair.  Why this sentence?  Nitin Nair did not understand that.

 Therefore, he asked the police officer for an explanation. The police officer gave a shocking answer that *it is illegal to give a lift to unknown persons.*

Nitin Nair did not believe this and thought that the police officer was rounding up to take bribe.  But the police officer behaved very harshly.  The next day he came to the police station, paid up the fine and asked for his license back. But he was only handed over the receipt for the fine. He had to come back empty handed.

Nitin Nair went back to the police station the next day. He was informed about *Section 66 in The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988*. Police said he was convicted under the Necessity for Permits, so he had to go to court and pay a fine and get his license revoked.

Nitin was now thoroughly confused and worried. He consulted with lawyers.  Only then did it become clear to him that indeed really as per the law, *it was illegal to give a lift to unknown persons in a private vehicle.*

Nitin Nayan, who went to court with no other option, pleaded guilty before the judge to the ‚Äòcrime‚Äô of converting his personal car into a passenger car by giving ‚Äòlifts‚Äô to unknown persons with the intention of helping.

 He was fined Rs 2,000.

After completing the court proceedings, Nitin Nair went back to the police station and was warned, *If you give anyone a lift again, your license will be confiscated.*

Nitin Nair, who was very upset about this, had poured his grunt on the Facebook page that if there were such laws, even if someone was dying on the road, no one would come forward to help.

 It is true that there are rules in the Indian Motor Vehicle Act that no person should use his private vehicle as a passenger vehicle or a freight vehicle. There are two reasons for this law.

The first reason is that some people use their own non-T-permit vehicles as taxis, to avoid paying taxes.  In this way they are making money illegally.

 The second reason is the safety of the vehicle owner.  If a lift is given to an unknown person, the owner of the vehicle may be harmed by a previously unknown person when the person arrives in the no-man's-land area.  This is why this law has been enacted and implemented.

*So think twice before Giving a Lift to anyone unknown*.  Let your friends and relatives know that such a Law exists.ü§î"

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Direct Attack on the Indian Minister of External Affairs by US Secretary of State, MR. ANTHONY BLINKEN.

Please read it fully.üòûüëç

*_INDIAN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER DR. JAISANKAR  WAS  SOMEWHAT SHOCKED AND PUZZLED  TO HEAR THE STATEMENT FROM THE  U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN ABOUT THE MINORITY PERSECUTION IN INDIA FOR THE FIRST TIME._*

Dr. Jaisankar is trying to shine forth through his talks, without proper reference to any reality!

He made a statement that he has a view of American persecution.   

Mr. Blinken replied with facts and figures.

Mr. External Affairs Minister,  1% of the U.S. population are Hindus,  the fourth religious population,  Christians-Jews-Muslims, and Hindus.   The U.S. population is 335 million.   That is the 8th largest Hindu population in the world according to the PEW research.

The largest percentage of Hindus are in the State of New Jersey, 3%.   2%  in California and Delaware, and 1% average in the rest of the States.   They have the highest income ratio in the nation.   There are hundreds of Hindu Temples nationwide.

_The first generation of Hindus migrated, and the 2nd and the rest of the generation are born here.   The Indian Christians were not migrated,  their roots are 2000 years._

Can you tell us:

~ How many Hindus were attacked in the U.S.?   

~ How many Hindu Temples were attacked in the U.S.?  

~ Why the Hindus are trying everything to migrate to a Christian majority nation from the paradise of Hinduism under the BJP rule led by PM Modi?

~ Do you know Mr. Jaisankar,   in 10 States of India,  there is anti-conversion law specifically targeting Christians?  

~ Can you show any such law anywhere in the U.S.?   

*That is the number one violation of human rights.*

_Among the 50 nations where Christians are persecuted for their faith,  India ranks 10th in place._  

~ Do you know the attacks against the Christians in India since your BJP rule came into exitance in 2014?

You were educated at the famous St. Stephens College in New Delhi.  That is a very well-known Christian college in India.   Rev. C. F. Andrews,  the Professor of Philosophy was the mentor of Mahatma Gandhi.   Have you ever been forced to convert to the Christian faith while you were a student there?   

~ Why did you and your parents show greater interest for you to study in a Christian College?

*_If you can't answer these questions,  then your logic has no validity._*"

Today's India is a garland of flowers in the hands of a ""monkey"". 

I am neither a Congressman, nor a Communist, nor a Modi bhakt. 

I am only an ordinary citizen who loves my country...

In the last 70 years, India, irrespective of caste and creed, has progressed greatly. For this, all the Prime Ministers who have ruled India have worked day and night. The result is that Today India is a great power in the world. 

*Even before Modiji was born, India had won the war against Pakistan. Even before Modiji started speaking, India had the best constitution in the world.*

 *When Modiji* played the game of bajra and kolam, India built the Bhakra Nangal Canal. ...

 India opened the Nuclear Research Centre while flipping through the book ""Modiji"" in the school...

 *When Modiji was learning how to light a lamp, India had started the Tarapur nuclear power plant.

 *Even before Modiji got dressed. They have started weaving cloth in India.*

AIIMS, IIT and many other universities were started in India.... 

""Modiji* was selling tea when trains like Rajdhani Express were running fast. 

How many benefits India has seen one or two all the benefits have already been accomplished.

 *Still others believe, or try to believe it‚Äî everything has happened because of Modi in the last four years. As.!!!*

*In fact, ""Modiji"" has taken India back by 40 years out of four years.*

In the line of those who stood hand in hand to create a casteless, communally harmonious India, 
Modi came as a casteist in his head.

I am Maher Ali Rusho From Bangladesh ! I have some queries about the verified signatory of IFCN Fact Checker  Organisations , Kindly please answer the questions please , as you know I am going to do   some investigations about fact checking organisations about their ethics and policies since many company and individuals asked me some question that i can't answer without any reference of yours ..  , so I think only you can help me by giving some insightful informations .. So that general people be informed about the policies and ethics by the verified recognised signatory organisations of yours .. Waiting for your kind response 
Question : 1
Can a senior fact checker and author of a fact checking report  in a fact checking organisation , who is a verified signatory of your esteemed organization, write and attach their own comment   in their fact checking feature or report like attacking, disrespectful, and verbally abusive  towards any individual on social media profile?
Question 2 
Suppose there are countless authorized peer reviewed   news reports on this topic  as an example , John Doe  has completed his masters degree in physics from Harvard university and moved towards Phd in MIT . And then suppose a news reporter of a media  reports all things   correctly but at some point of the news by being in slip of tongue he reports like this "" John Doe  has completed his masters degree in physics from Harvard university and moved towards Phd on that university "" -  And the  report was not viral also and since the previous authorized peered reviewed  news were featured in many places so that almost everyone understand that ""Slip of tongue"" Issue . Then will it be considered as a rumour by a senior fact checker???
Question : 3
Can a fact checking organization claim to be a verified signatory of your  organisation and also is currently recognized by your esteemed organisation  on their wikipedia page & also website in their renewal ongoing  process period ???
Question : 4 
Suppose a news channel named ""XYZ""  publishes an interview with  a distinguished achiever in around 30 minutes ??? Then they think the interview has some authentication problem ..What they did they officially deleted the previous video from their website  and unlisted it from the youtube channel .. And re edited it and republish the video with all authenticated information in around 18 minutes .. So now the question is ""can  a fact checker have the right to make a report and claim that it is still till now spreading rumors !!!!!!! That is now already  officially deleted and also unlisted unclaimed by the news channel and not exists anywhere in the news site , and has been told that 18 minutes is the official video of that news channel , CAN A FACT CHECKER STILL SAY IT IS SPREADING RUMORS??? DOES HE HAVE ANY RIGHT TO SAY THIS IS SPREADING RUMOURS TILL NOW  THAT IS ALREADY REMOVED AND REPUBLISH IT BY THE CHANNEL
Please waiting for your valuable response , I need to ensure the general public about the policies and ethics of your verified signatory's organizations and also ensure the quality of a fact checking organisation

       Election of the Chief Justice of the International Court of Justice.


        Big win for India.

       Prime Minister Modi's Chanakya Diplomacy. Britain's defeat on the world stage.

        This is a classic example of how PM Modiji has built relationships across the world.


        Justice Dalveer Bhandari has been elected as the Chief Justice of the International Court of Justice.


        Justice Dalvir Singh of India received 183 votes out of 193 (one from each country represented) and defeated Justice Christopher Greenwood of Britain.


     He broke Britain's 71-year monopoly on the post.


       Prime Minister Modi and the Ministry of External Affairs have been working hard for the last 6 months to achieve this! It was a very difficult task to contact the representatives of all 193 countries and explain India's position on the British candidate who was sure to win easily.


      In the 11th round of voting, Justice Dalvir Bhandari received 183 of the 193 votes in the General Assembly and 15 of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council.



         Justice Dalveer Bhandari will hold the post for a period of 9 years. These 183 countries voted for India, none of them are ""blind Modi devotees""! All of them are thoughtful, this is a great example of how courteous, respectful and good relations our Prime Minister Modiji has built with countries around the world after 70 years of our independence.



       Indian news media don't broadcast such great things, they want news against Modi, that's what they search for and broadcast.

*Most of the Pensioners hesitate in filing returns, but, here is an important information that shows that filing IT returns has great advantage to the family of Pensioners at the time of any accidental death of the Pensioner.*
*As per section 166 of the motor vehicle act,* *1988 ( Supreme Court Judgement under Civil appeal No. 9858 of 2013, arising out of SLP ( C) No. 1056 of 2008 dated 31st October 2013),*
*The family of the Pensioner died in accident is entitled to 10 times of average income of the last three years, provided he or she had filed the IT returns for the past three years.*
*For example, if the monthly pension of a pensioner is 25000 /- his annual income is 3,00,000. For three years his average income also say, for easy calculations is 3,00,000, then his family will get 10 times of 3 lakhs - 30, 00, 000 Rupees from the Government. No other proof, other than IT returns will be admitted by the Court also. So, filing IT returns by the Pensioner regularly, will  go a long way in providing a big economic relief to the bereaved family of the Pensioner on his / her death by accident.*
*Failure to file IT returns due to lack of information about this advantage leads to huge loss to the family of the Pensioner on his death*

She wrote .........

When former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh came to Germany, he brought around 40 people with him who were from media and some of their and his relatives. 

A total of five hotels (all Five-Star) were booked for their stay.

All the people shopped in expensive Malls every day and bought things for lakhs and lakhs of Rupees.

The bills were charged in the name of the entire State Department. 

This was the daily story throughout the currency of Manmohan Singh's tour.

The entire Indian-staff servant of the State Department used to dance in front of them all. 

Manmohanji did not come to the Embassy even once or meet us. 

Now when Modiji came to Germany twice as Prime Minister, the entire staff was expecting the same show again. 

But I'm surprised he came all alone! 

There is no army of media persons and their relatives. 

So only one floor of the hotel was fully booked for reasons of Security & Safety. 

There is no shopping in the Malls 

They are busy with work fulltime. 

The Embassy staff was not allowed to do chamchagiri; 

Rather, the staff continued to carry out the day-to-day tasks of their office. 

In fact, we were so busy collecting all the data and putting it in the file folder that we could not go home for three days. 

Despite his busy schedule, Modiji took some time out and came to the Embassy and gave credit to everyone for making the visit a success and they all had a cup of tea with him. 

This is an introduction to a great person! 

Friends, After years, you have got an honest Prime Minister, Respect him; 

Teach them a lesson by defeating the opposition that degrades them every time and save the country.

Currently, I am a part-time independent contributor with a U.S. A.I company called Appen Limited for 2 years now. I am a Social Media Evaluator. I work for the company remotely. My work is to analyze sentiments shared by Facebook and Instagram users to weed out claims that are misinformation. Now I often refer to resources published by PesaCheck, among other independent fact-checkers, to make inferences. I do a lot of research nearly every day looking for misinformation across all social media platforms, and many a time, I come across viral claims that have been posted by various users that are glaringly misinformation and have not been fact-checked yet. I am a governance and policy enthusiast, which can be told more at a blog website that I personally run. Not only that, but I am also a sucker for verifiable information and trueness that often shape how we make pivotal decisions in our society at large. Now, with the wealth of knowledge and experience that I possess, I believe there is a significant value that I can add to Pesa Check. My interest is to join  PesaCheck since my ideals align with Pesa Check's mission at a greater extent. My email is odongojohn82@gmail.comEragerly waiting for positive feedback. Thank you in advance

SPECIAL REPORT : Narayana Murti reveals his wealth secret to enrich ordinary people
SPECIAL REPORT : Narayana Murti reveals his wealth secret to enrich ordinary people
Author: Charu Khatri | New Delhi

Wednesday, August 9, 1:07:41 pm
 

""This is my dream, all ordinary people in India can afford what they want. India with the richest people in the world. I think it will be useful for so many people, so it's important that everyone knows about it,"" explains Narayana. ‚ÄúPeople are experiencing financial difficulties and now they have the opportunity to earn millions from the comfort of their homes. It's incredible!""

Appearing at a private investment forum, Narayana Murti, founder of Infosys, revealed that he had invested a decent amount of money in a new automated trading platform. The idea was simple: to give the average person the opportunity to earn at the peak of the popularity of digital currency, in the absence of absolutely any experience in investing or technology.‚ÄúI know that on television, if I told about the platform, the air would still be cut out, and the information would never reach the people. Realizing that there are still independent journalists in the hall, I ask you to inform ordinary people in your magazines and articles about the BITLQ MATRIX platform, as a chance and opportunity to earn millions. I'm counting on you,"" Narayana began his speech with these words.
The user simply makes an initial deposit to the platform, usually ¬£18,595 or more, and the auto trading algorithm starts working. Using a combination of data and machine learning, the algorithm will determine the ideal time to buy and sell digital assets, maximizing the user's profit. Narayana told us that he used his credit card for the initial deposit!
‚ÄúThe possibilities of crypto platforms are absolutely limitless! You can earn every day from anywhere in the world, it's very simple! However, a very small percentage of Indians have access to such earnings. Moreover, the authorities are trying in every possible way to prohibit the possibility of working with cryptocurrencies precisely because this is a very profitable niche for any citizen of India, which is not taxed.
I am investing most of my capital in the new BITLQ MATRIX platform so that the life of every resident of India becomes more convenient and interesting with the help of modern technologies and everyone has the opportunity to learn passive income at any age. "" said Narayana Murti.To showcase the platform's capabilities, Narayana asked YourStory founder and CEO Shradha Sharma to deposit ¬£18,595 live on the show.

During Narayana's performance, the sound engineer signed up on the platform and made an initial fee of ¬£18,595. He then started buying cryptocurrencies cheap and selling them very quickly for a higher price. In just 7 minutes Sharhad earned ¬£2432 and her total balance was ¬£21027.
Everyone in the audience, including the producers, was shocked. Narayana tried to calm everyone down and bluntly said that this platform is not a magic platform. ""If you look closely, you can see that in about 70-80% of cases, the number of winning trades exceeds the number of losing ones. Not all trades will bring you income, but rest assured that the percentage of unsuccessful trades is not high at all, and you will never have a negative balance,‚Äù Narayana added.

Naturally, we were skeptical that such a simple thing could be so profitable. Therefore, the editors of our magazine decided to test the BITLQ MATRIX system on themselves. It was not difficult to find a volunteer - every editorial staffer dreams of additional income. From all the volunteers, we chose Kailash Chahal, editor of our financial news department. Our experiment lasted four days, and here are the results.

1 day:
""The first thing I did was create an account on the registration page of this system. It took me about 2 minutes to enter my name, email address, phone number and password.
To activate the account, I needed to transfer 18595 rupees tomy new online wallet. Since it was just a balance transfer, it didn‚Äôt cost me anything. I knew for sure that I could return my money at any time. Moreover, with such a deposit amount, the platform participant is provided with a personal manager who is available 24 hours per day to help with any question.
Before I started trading, I experienced a lot of excitement. Is it really that simple?""

Day 2:
On the second day, I woke up and rushed to work. When I got to the office, I checked my email and drank coffee. Then I remembered that I forgot to check my balance! It was already 10:45 in the morning, that is, almost 12 hours had passed since I replenished my wallet. I went to the site feeling nervous and anxious. Will my funds still be there? I got a little worried...
I opened the site's dashboard. At first I thought I made a mistake. Was it my account? I double checked the account name in the corner, yes it was mine. I almost spilled my coffee! I saw that my new balance at that time was 24,802 rupees. Incredible! In just 12 hours while I slept, my account increased by Rs 6,207. I wrote to my account manager. Surprisingly, he was not as impressed as I was. ‚ÄúThis is a common thing,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúin fact, we often see people earn more in the first 12 hours.‚Äù
Day 3:
‚ÄúOn the third day of my experiment, I got really carried away. I saw that this was not some complex system for fund managers and stockbrokers. It was not only easy, but it was very clear how I make so much money. I finally understood why famous billionaires called it the new economy: 100 times more powerful than anything I could ever imagine. Before I fell asleep that night, my balance sheet showed me a staggering Rs 30,142.""

Day 4:
""Things really took off today. I made a few more deposits. The balance at the end of the day was Rs 42,614. In just 4 wonderful days, I earned my monthly salary! I decided to withdraw Rs 40,000 to my savings account
After 5 minutes, my bank manager called, wondering how I managed to make such money. When I told him that I had access to the platform, he told me that I was not the first person who made huge money on it, and invited me talk about investment opportunities...""
Our editorial conclusions after our investigation:
The ""BitLQ Matrix"" latform really works - the invested funds pay off in a day, and the investment system itself is quite transparent. The amount of the down payment is available to most citizens of India and is 18,595 rupees. On other similar platforms, the entry barrier is many times higher. It is also worth noting the fact that BITLQ MATRIX guarantees you a safe deposit and withdrawal of funds - and for a novice investor this is a very important factor.

Advantages of the unique development of BITLQ MATRIX:
 Accessibility for everyone
Any citizen of India can become a member of the platform. To do this, just go through a simple registration.
Simplicity
The BITLQ MATRIX platform is simple and intuitive - without any trading knowledge, you can learn in less than 10 minutes and start earning.
Convenience
The algorithm will do everything for you - you do not need to help it or do something instead of it. The BITLQ MATRIX platform will work for you.
No risk
94% of trades will be closed in your favor, which means that you will make a profit on almost all trades.
Reliability
The platform is state-owned and supported by the state, so none of the participants are at risk.
To become a member of the platform, you need to complete the following steps:
Follow this link to the official website of the platform from BitLQ Matrix.
Register on the site by carefully and correctly filling in all the fields of the form.
Wait for a call from the platform manager to your mobile phone number and confirmation of registration.
Choose the amount you want and get your first payout by the evening of the day.

I've been using this service for five years now, so I signed up to their platform straight away. The first day was a bit scary because I was transferring my salary balances there, but the next morning the panic had stopped - my balance increased almost 2.5 times! overnight:) I recommend it!

2,100,909	"The Reaction Of PARSI Community for Rahul ‚ÄòS Allegations Against TATAS !!! Pl go through their Reactions !!!!
üò†üò°üëä


*Open letter to RAGA by a Parsi Gentleman*.üëáüëáüëá



*Dear Mr. Rahul Gandhi.*üò¢


I am forced to write this to you since you have crossed all limits for a person who is defination of the word gentleman. I do agree that you politicians drag each other in your dirty politics. But my question is why did u drag the gentleman who has done this nation proud. During your recent various visits to Gujarat, I have observed that in each of your rally you have mentioned this Parsi Gentleman's name. Do you even know what sort of person he is ? Have you even thought of the loss which you will have to bear by dragging this Parsi Gentleman's into your dirty politics. See the grace of this man that he has not even bothered to react to your constant pocking.  *Otherwise, his one word about UPA government pressure on him to create a joint venture company with Pakistan and his refusal to do so with enemy country would have been enough to shut up you, your mom and sister.* That is the brand value he has. In each of the rally, You are actually putting fingers in his mouth waiting that he will react but plz try n understand that he is above all this. If we common people can understand this, how come you can't. This assures me to believe our PM's view regarding your IQ. Every morning you shouted in Gujarat that Modi gave 33,000 crores to that Gentleman at free of cost. Do you even think before you speak. Plz go through the Tata Motors statement regarding your rubbish mockery.  I still feel that Tata Motors Ltd. should also have refrained from issuing statement with regards to your comment. As the world knows what is Tata legacy. For a change, even if I assume that Tata's were given free land then there is nothing wrong after all, the good charity Tata Trust does for the society. It is better to give land to tata's instead of Robert Vadra as atleast the profits generated by Tata Companies will be used for charity whereas we know of your family. 
Today, as we go for the first round of polls, my only request is plz remorse your statement. We Parsis may be very less in numbers to affect your vote bank but there are many sympathy bearers in other community for us who will surely react n affect your results. I know that this will not make a big impact on results as you have people like Mani Shankar Iyer who are sufficient to ensure that you loose. But by taking back this statement, you will atleast get some bonus points. We Parsis consider India as our motherland so how can we think of selling the same. It's a pitty that you think so low (plz contact Mani Iyer for meaning of low) for a person (Tata's) who celebrated this Diwali by donating 1000 crores for Cancer Hospitals while you were celebrating Diwali out of India. Hope you will apologise after reading this & prove that you are not a Pappu. Though chances are very remote as your cautery is enough to prove that you are.......


Regards,



~~~~~~~~~~*Tribute to Parsis*

Parsis are just 0.1% of total population, or maybe even less..........YET.........

They never asked for minority status...

They never asked for reservations...

They never f‚Äãight‚Äã with Indian Government...

They never felt threatened by Hindus...

They never throw bombs or stones or damage public property...

They never indulge in crimes or run the underworld...

All they do is to contribute mightily to the progress of India...

They gave us the best.....

They are a beautiful People...A beautiful and dignified Race....

I wish we had more of the Parsis who could teach our other greedy minorities as to what minority really means......It means NOT to be parasite or a leech on the host country...It means to give, & NOT to take...

All those who are asking for minority status, then and today, ought to be ashamed of themselves.

You owe a lot to this nation. Pay back, rather than asking from nation.

_Kindly circulate. Let it reach to all those who are already minority and to all those who are still asking for ‚Äãspecial status._

2,126,457	"* DOES PM MODI DESERVE ANY CREDIT FOR THE CHANDRAYAN-3 SUCCESS* - 

*A FACT CHECK*

1) When you don‚Äôt have a Strong PM, a Great Scientist like Shri Nambinarayan who was about to get us a breakthrough in indigenous Cryogenic Engines for ISRO, gets fraudulently/falsely arrested with foreign influence & put in jail to jeopardise his efforts. 30 yrs later SC exonerates him. But in the bargain Indian Space Programme gets postponed by 15 yrs. 

2) From 2004 to 2014 during the Sonia led UPA times, the Govt gave ISRO funds of  Rs 7000 Crores. 

Forget 14 yrs of UPA even during the whole 65 yrs that CONgress was in power, it gave ISRO funds of just 
Rs 40000/- Cr. 

But Modiji in just 9yrs from 2014 to 2023 has given ISRO funds of 
Rs 1Lakh Crores. 

Without funding how do you expect our Scientists to perform. 

3) From 1979 until 2023, ISRO has sent a total of 424 foreign satellites in space, out of which 390 were sent in the 9yrs period under Modi, which is nearly 90%. 

4) Which also means that the 34 Foreign Satellites sent in space during the 65yrs of CONgress time ISRO earned in US Dollars 17Cr 40Lakhs. 

And in just 9 yrs of Modi period ISRO has earned 
In US Dollars 15Cr 60Lakhs. 

And if you add ISRO earnings in EURO‚Äôs in the whole of 65 yrs of CONgress rule it is 
- EU 25Cr 60Lakhs

And in just the 9yrs of Modi/BJP time, ISRO has earned in Euros - 22Cr 30Lakhs 

5) After the CHANDRAYAN 1 failure in 2008, UPA under Sonia/MaunMohan Singh panicked & put on hold the ISRO programme fearing criticism. 

But during Modi‚Äôs time in 2019, inspite of the partial failure of CHANDRAYAN 2, ISRO got full encouragement & funding from PM Modi to go ahead. 

And as a result in just next 
4 yrs, ISRO managed to go for CHANDRAYAN 3, and the World acknowledges it as a unique success when India manages to land, for the first time,  on Moon‚Äôs South Pole. 

The experiments that CHANDRAYAN 3 will carry out now will give INDIA a valuable knowledge in Scientific Space Explorations in the coming future. 

Not only that but because of the extreme cost effectiveness of our CHANDRAYAN 3 which just cost $ 75 Million, INDIA will now be able to attract other countries in the ‚ÄòBusiness‚Äô of Space Explorations.

2,128,699	"What has a little Church in Kerala got to do with India's Space journey to the Moon?

In 1962, scientists Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, Dr. Homi Bhabha and their team, which included young Dr. Abdul Kalam, were scouting around looking for an ideal place to set up India's first Space Research Station.

Deep down in Kerala, between the coast and a railway line, they came across a red stone Church, in a tiny hamlet called Thumba. 

The Church was dedicated to Mary Magdalene, the woman whom Jesus appeared to first, after his resurrection.

The Church was located at the most ideal spot for a Space Research Station, because it was almost exactly on the wavy magnetic Equator (different from the geographical Equator), where the Earth's magnetic field was weakest.

The scientists approached the local Bishop of Trivandrum, Reverend Peter Bernard Pereira who invited them to Sunday Mass, to address the parishioners, who were mostly fisherfolk.

After the Mass, Bhabha and Sarabhai explained their case to the parishioners and requested that the church land, including the Church, be handed over to them for India's first Space Research Station.

The parishioners agreed. The Church, along with 90 acres of church land were given over to the scientists and 183 families living on the land, also relocated. A new church was built for them within a short time.

The Bishop's quarters became the office of the Thumba Space Station and the Church became its workshop.

The sandalwood statue of Mary Magdalene remained where it was, on the altar looking down on the rocket scientists building India's first space rockets.

The Thumba Church still stands today, but it has been turned into a Space museum.

Dr. Abdul Kalam, the soft spoken, academic and ""rocket man"" of India, mentions this true story in his book ""Ignited Minds""

The thing to admire here, was that a Hindu (Sarabhai), a Parsi (Bhabha) and a Muslim (Abdul Kalam) made the request to the Christians, who willingly gave up their Church for a National cause.

So, while celebrating our Nation's Moon landing, lets also remember the Thumba villagers who gave up their church and their land for our Nation's future glory."

PM Modi is generally underestimated as a soft-spoken gentleman, but not many of us know that when he lashes out at his opponents, he makes them bleed! Here's an example, covered by our corrupt media for obvious reasons... Congress leader in Parliament, Mallikarjun Kharge, a Dalit, as everyone knows, raised a question in Parliament with the gestures and ""body language"" of a warrior, literally shouting in a hoarse voice, shaking his limbs vigorously. Question to Modi! You should allocate atleast one percent of land per family for our Dalits! There was pin drop silence in the Lok Sabha. Everyone was on the edge of their seats, pausing for a moment as if they were waiting to ""dramatize"" it! Modiji got up from his seat after taking some time. He asked Khadge, ""Aren't you yourself a Dalit?"" Do you know how much land you own? I must declare Due to Khadge's reluctance, Modiji continued. Well, I'll tell myself! ‚ÄúYou have a Rs 500 crore commercial complex in Bangalore's Bannerghatta area. There is a 300 acre coffee estate in Chikmagalur. There is a 50 crore rupees bungalow in that place! There is a 40 crore farm house in Kangeri! Ramaiah College has a building worth 25 crores! Another bungalow in Bangalore! 17 Acre Agricultural Land in Bellary Road! There is a three storied building in Indira Nagar Bangalore! 2 Bungalows in Bangalore Sadashiv Nagar! In addition to the above may I read the list of properties in the name of your family members located in Mysore? In Gulburga, Chennai, Goa, Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai and Delhi? Now Mallikarjun Kharge's face turned pale! ‚ÄúIf one percent of land is allotted to Dalits then all the above persons need not be allotted land? There was a grave silence in the Congress court. None of the Congress colleagues could open their mouths. Members of the ruling party began banging on the table, and the noise grew louder and echoed throughout Parliament. It took a full 5 minutes for him to calm down. Why did the media not bring this sensational news and why kept a terrible silence? Don't know what 'price' Mallikarjun Kharge paid to buy media's 'silence'!? Whatever happens, we and you will tell this to the whole world and expose the machinations of the Anti-National Congress and its new croonist, Krypto, the leader! Will the Constitution or the Supreme Court say anything or not? This is called public system of looting. If ED investigates now, counter action will be taken. *This message must be sent to at least 5 groups...some people won't send...but I'm sure you will surely*"

Now even after becoming sr citizens, they have to pay all the taxes. There is no scheme for sr citizens in India. 50% discount on railways/air travel, has also been discontinued. The other side of the picture is that sr citizens in politics MLA, MP or Minister, are given every possible benefit and they also get pensions. I fail to understand why all others ( except some Govt employees) are denied the same facilities. Imagine, if the children are not caring about them ,where will they go. If the elders of the country go against the Govt in elections, it will affect the election results . Government will have to face the consequences. Srs have the power to change the government, don't ignore them. They have the life long experience to change the Govt. Don't consider them weak ! So many schemes are required for the benefits of seniors . The govt spends a lot of money on welfare schemes, but never realizes about sr citizens. On the contrary, the income of sr citizens is decreasing due to reduction in interest rates of banks. If some of them are getting a meager pension to support the family & self, it is also subject to income tax. So sr citizens should be considered for some benefits : (1). All citizens above 60 must be given pension (2). Everybody must be given pension as per status (3). Concession in railway, bus & air travel. (4). Insurance should be must for all upto the last breath & premium must be paid by the Govt. (5). Court cases of sr citizens must be given priority for early decision. (6). Sr. citizens homes in every city with all facilities (7). Govt should amend the rule of scrapping 10 -15 yrs old used cars.This rule should be applied only for commercial vehicles. Our cars are purchased on loan & our uses are only 40 to 50000 km in 10 yrs. Our cars are as good as new one. If our cars are scrapped, then we must be given new cars. I request all Sr citizens and youth to share it on all social media. Let's hope that this government, who is sincere all the time and talks of *""Sab ka saath, sab ka vikas""* will do some for the betterment of those who have contributed in nation building and are now past their prime."" Please share with your friends, sr citizens and well wishers."

The chemical *Methylxanthine*, *Theobromine* and *Theophylline* stimulate compounds that can ward off these virus in a human with atleast an average immune system. Whats more shocking is that these complex words that were so difficult for people in China to understand is actually called *COFFEE * in India, YES, our regular COFFEE has all these chemicals already in it. The main Methylxanthine in COFFEE is the stimulant caffeine. Other Methylxanthines found in COFFEE are two chemically similar compounds, Theobromine and Theophylline. The COFFEE plant creates these chemicals as a way to ward off insects and other animals. Who would have known that all the solution to these virus would be a simple cup of COFFEE and that is the reason so many patients in China are being cured.

Our Foreign Minister S Jaishankar played a very important role in this. In just 30 minutes, this entire committee was ordered to leave India within the next ten days! India has shown the way out of India to the UN Military Observer Group, a committee of the United Nations! This committee was working in India since 1948 and was keeping a close watch on the attitude of India and Pakistan, especially India itself, on the Kashmir issue. India was bearing all the expenses of working, traveling, living, eating, getting up and down! This committee had given very strong statements against India. It tried to declare Kashmir a trilateral issue rather than a bilateral one and also made serious allegations against India such as *""India is obstructing the work of the United Nations Military Observer Group between us, India and Pakistan so that the committee does not function properly.""* The committee did not stop here‚Ä¶ It further said ‚ÄúThe amount that India gives us does not cover our expenses. So India will have to increase our allowances and expenses and India will have to pay for it!‚Äù It so happened that the dog we had kept was eating ours and was barking at us and had even started biting. On this the Government of India only said to the Committee : ""We have suffered a lot because of your drama.

It's far far more dangerous than Alchol and Smoking put together.* *India is the highest importer for Palm oil in this world.* The Palm oil mafia is very very big. *Our children, who are the future, are at a big risk.* There is no fast food available in this country without Palm Oil. If you *go to our grocery store, try to pick up a children's edible food without Palm oil - you will not succeed.* You will be interested to know *even Biscuits of big companies are made from it, and similarly all chocolates*. We are made to believe they are healthy, but we never knew about *the killer Palm oil or Palmitic acid* The big companies like *Lays use different oil in Western Countries and Palm oil in India* just because it is Cheap. Each time our child eats a product with Palm Oil, the brain behaves inappropriately and signals to secrete fat around and in the Heart *This leads to Diabetes at a very young age.* The World Economic Form has projected that 50 percent of people who Die at young age will die of Diabetes and Heart Disease. *The Palm Oil mafia has made our Children addicted to Junk Food, leaving the fruits and Vegetables aside, which are Heart protective.* Next time you buy something for your child, see the label of the product. If it has Palm oil or Palmolienic oil or Palmitic acid, avoid buying it! We, have written to our Hon'ble Prime Minister and are also in the process of making similar letters from 1 Lakh Doctors across India to take some action to secure our future generations. Once again I want to emphasize on impending danger to our children. Pls protect our Children. They are the future of our Country! Please forward this message.

The mayor of the Montreal suburb of Dorval has refused, and the town-clerk sent a note to all parents to explain why. Here's that note: ‚ÄúMuslims must understand that they have to adapt to Canada and Quebec, its customs, its traditions, its way of life, because that's where they chose to immigrate. ‚ÄúThey must understand that they have to integrate and learn to live in Quebec. ‚ÄúThey must understand that it is for them to change their lifestyle, not the Canadians who so generously welcomed them. ‚ÄúThey must understand that Canadians are neither racist nor xenophobic, they accepted many immigrants before Muslims (whereas the reverse is not true, in that Muslim states do not accept non-Muslim immigrants). ‚ÄúThat no more than other nations, Canadians are not willing to give up their identity, their culture. ‚ÄúAnd if Canada is a land of welcome, it's not the Mayor of Dorval who welcomes foreigners, but the Canadian-Quebecois people as a whole. ‚ÄúFinally, they must understand that in Canada (Quebec) with its Judeo-Christian roots, Christmas trees, churches and religious festivals, religion must remain in the private domain. The municipality of Dorval was right to refuse any concessions to Islam and Sharia. ‚ÄúFor *Muslims who disagree* with secularism and *do not feel comfortable in Canada,* there are *57 beautiful Muslim countries* in the world, most of them *under-populated* and ready to receive them with open halal arms in accordance with Sharia. *‚ÄúIf you left your country for Canada,* and *not for* other *Muslim countries,* it is because *YOU* have *considered* that *life is better in Canada than elsewhere.* *‚ÄúAsk yourself the question,* just once, *‚ÄúWhy is it better here in Canada than where you come from?‚Äù* 'A canteen with pork' is part of the answer.‚Äù ***************** *EXEMPLARY*. Share this to *PROMOTE TOLERANCE* in the world. This is what should be adopted by all countries. üå≠üå≠üçîüçîü´ïü´ïü•£ü•£üçπüçπ

2,445,212	If Mr. Modi had not served 3 terms as the CM of Gujarat and 2 terms as the PM of India, would Adani have been in the position he is in today? As a C A having audited many big Companies and scrutinised many big contracts, I am in a position to answer this good questions: There are big companies like L & T, Reliance, Tatas, Birlas etc and Adani group of companies is one among them and are doing well against the tuff competition from these giants. Even C and AG did not find any fault in their successful bidding and getting awarded huge sized contracts. Their track record of completing their contracts ahead of contract period and with satisfactory quality execution is reasonably good. pl introspect on the following moot points: Are you aware that Adhani Groups pay tax of more than ‚Çπ.50,000+ crores every year to the country. Are you aware the company pays millions of people salaries every month to the tune of more than Rs. 20000 crores, to help in running the livelihood of millions of families? Are you aware how many subcontractors are benefited through Adani Groups. Are you aware how many intermediaries are benefited through Adani Groups. Are you aware of the kind of enormous infrastructure developed by Adani Groups, not only in India and throughout the world? They have been taking loans from banks for the last about 40 years and have paid / are still paying crores of interest, paid back the full loan & retaken new Loans for new business opportunities. All the loans and finances taken from banks are backed by adequate guarantees & collateral to the Banks, for at least, their basic safety. Tell me how the political leaders like congress and communists and other so called (pseudo) secular political leaders who are raising hue and cry on Adani‚Äôs issue have got interest-free loans from Banks ???* Has anybody raised similar hue and cry on a congress leaders‚Äô great brother-in-law, Vadhva who started his business, with a paid up Capital of ‚Çπ 1 lakh, 15 years ago, become owner of hotels & property, worth several crores, including several acres of land: Apart from this do you know that the family own 2 bungalows and 6 flats in London ???* Has anybody raised any question particularly the foreign agents and media on how he was able to get such large amounts of money, when the fact remains that it has been reported that they become the fourth richest family (Soniaji family) in the world. As long as they - Adani groups are contributing for the development of infrastructure and welfare activities for the country and running business honestly, creating and providing enough employment opportunities, let us not worry even if there is any favouritism because it is favouritism to competent person / company !

2,491,261	1.5 century-old Vaseline sells 1000 units of petroleum jelly EVERY MINUTE! And, it was invented simply because a 22-year-old was BORED. Here‚Äôs what happened In 1859‚Äì Robert Chesebrough‚Äì a 22-year-old US chemist‚Äì was bored with his job. So, he decided to travel to the new oil fields to study rod wax‚Äì a waste residue that had to be regularly removed. Then he noticed something peculiar- the oil workers were rubbing this wax on their cuts & burns, supposedly to heal them. So, he collected this black, waxy substance & returned to New York. He tested & perfected the purification of this gel over the next decade and started demonstrating his newfound miracle‚Äì By publicly burning his skin & applying the gel on it to show its healing properties. In 1872, joining ‚Äòwasser‚Äô (German for water) & ‚Äòoleon‚Äô (Greek for oil)‚Äì he named the product ‚ÄòVaseline‚Äô & started selling it across the US. People started using it for various purposes‚Äì From new mothers for babies‚Äô diaper rashes to travellers in extreme cold conditions (because Vaseline doesn‚Äôt freeze). By 1875, Vaseline was selling a bottle every minute! But, then sprung a new problem‚Äì Imitation jellies. That‚Äôs when Robert launched the iconic Blue Seal to mark authentic products. Vaseline became a part of not just US households, but also the first successful North Pole expedition and both the World Wars! By 1955, Vaseline merged with Pond‚Äôs which was ultimately acquired by Unilever in 1987. Vaseline is a timeless invention in the cosmetics industry. In fact, in 1965, Thomas Williams‚Äì a pharmacist‚Äì saw his sister mix coal powder with vaseline to make mascara. That‚Äôs when he joined ‚ÄòMABEL‚Äô (his sister‚Äôs name) + vaseLINE to start Maybelline‚Äì the iconic makeup brand.

2,502,580	"Singapore News! Everyone is advised to wear a mask because the new COVID-Omicron XBB variant of the coronavirus is different, deadly and not easy to detect properly:- Symptoms of the new virus COVID-Omicron XBB are as follows:- 1. No cough. 2. No fever. There will just be a lot :- 3. Joint pain. 4. Headache. 5. Neck pain. 6. Upper back pain. 7. Pneumonia. 8. Generally no appetite. Of course, COVID-Omicron XBB is 5 times more virulent and has a higher death rate than the Delta variant. The condition takes a shorter time to reach extreme severity, sometimes without obvious symptoms. Let's be more careful! This type of virus does not reside in the nasopharyngeal area and directly affects the lungs, namely the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù, in a relatively short time. Several patients diagnosed with Covid Omicron XBB were finally classified as having no fever, no pain, but X-ray results showed mild chest pneumonia. Nasal swab tests frequently provide negative results for COVID-Omicron XBB, and cases of nasopharyngeal tests providing false negative results are increasing. This means that the virus can spread in the community and directly infect the lungs, causing viral pneumonia which can cause acute respiratory stress. This explains why Covid-Omicron XBB is very contagious, very virulent and deadly. Please note, avoid crowded places, keep a distance of 1.5 m even in open spaces, wear a two-layer mask, use a suitable mask, and wash your hands frequently if everyone is asymptomatic (not coughing or sneezing). Covid Omicron *""WAVE""* is more deadly than the first wave of Covid-19. So we have to be very careful and take all kinds of coronavirus precautions. Also maintain vigilant communication with your friends and family. Don't keep this information to yourself, share it with as many other relatives and friends as possible, especially your own family and friendsüôè"

2,536,073	*Ayodhya Memories* üôè Some information which we never knew. _*A must-know post for every Hindu.*_ All Hindus should remember *K.K.Nair, the man who started the Primary action for us to recover the land of Sri Rama in Ayodhya.* _*Kandangalam Karunakaran Nair known as K.K.Nair was born on September 7, 1907 in a small village called Gutankadu, Alappuzha, Kerala.*_ Before India's independence, he went to England and at the age of 21, became a barrister and succeeded in the ICS examination before returning home. He worked in Kerala for some time and was known for his honesty and bravery and earned a reputation as a servant of the people. In 1945 he joined Uttar Pradesh state as a civil servant. He served in various posts and was appointed _*Deputy Commissioner and District Magistrate of Faizabad on June 1, 1949.*_ Following a complaint that the child Ram Vigraham suddenly appeared in Ayodhya the then Prime Minister Nehru ordered the State Government to investigate and submit a report. The Chief Minister of the state, Govind Vallabh Pant, requested K.K.Nair to go there and make enquiries. Nair asked his subordinate, Shri Guru Dutt Singh, to investigate and submit a report. Singh went there and presented a detailed report to KK Nair. _*His report said that Hindus worshiped Ayodhya as the birthplace of Lord Rama (Ram Lalla). But the Muslims were creating problems claiming there was a mosque. His report reiterated that it was a Hindu temple. He suggested that a big temple should be built there. His report said that the Government should allocate land for it and Muslims should be banned from going to that area.*_ Based on that report _*Nair issued orders prohibiting Muslims from going within a radius of 500 meters of the temple. (It is noteworthy that neither the government nor the court has been able to lift this ban till date).*_ Hearing this, _*Nehru fretted and fumed and got upset. He wanted the State Government to order the immediate evacuation of the Hindus from the area and removal of the Ram Lalla.*_ The Chief Minister Govind Vallabh Pant ordered Nair to immediately evacuate the Hindus and remove the idol of the Ram Lalla. _*But Nair refused to implement the order. On the other hand, he issued another order stating that daily pooja should be performed to Rama Lalla. The order also said that the Government should bear the cost for the pooja and the salary of the priest who performed pooja.*_ _*Terrified by this order, Nehru immediately ordered Nair‚Äôs removal from service. When dismissed, Nair went to the Allahabad Court and himself argued successfully against Nehru Order of his dismissal.*_ The Court ordered that Nair should be reinstated and allowed to work in the same place. The Court's order was like smearing Nehru‚Äôs face with black ink. Hearing this order, the residents of Ayodhya urged Nair to contest in the elections. But Nair pointed out that being a Government Servant he could not stand for elections. _*The residents of Ayodhya wanted Nair's wife to contest. Accepting the people's request, Mrs. Shakuntala Nair entered the fray as a candidate in Ayodhya during Uttar Pradesh's first Legislative Assembly elections.*_ At that time, the Congress candidates won all over the country. _*But in Ayodhya alone, the Congress candidate who contested against Nair's wife lost by a margin of several thousands.*_ _*Mrs. Shakuntala Nair joined the Jana Sangh in 1952 and started developing the organisation.*_ A shocked Nehru and the Congress started pressurising Nair. _*He resigned from his post and started working as an advocate in the Allahabad High Court.*_ When the elections for the Parliament was announced in the year 1962, the people succeeded in persuading Nair and his wife to contest. They wanted him to speak about Ayodhya before Nehru. _*People helped the Nair couple to win both Bahraich and Kaisarganj constituencies. It was a historic achievement.*_ And as a pleasant surprise, even his driver was also elected as a member of the State Legislative Assembly from the Faisalabad constituency. Later, the Indira regime imposed a state of emergency in the country and _*arrested the couple and imprisoned them. But their arrest caused a huge uproar in Ayodhya, and a scared Government released them from jail.*_ The couple returned to Ayodhya and continued their public work. The BJP has always been winning both Assembly and Parliamentary elections from Ayodhya except for one or two times. _*Nair was the first to deal with the Ayodhya case after independence*_. It was entirely handled by him. And even now, the anti-Hindu elements have not been able to change the orders issued by him as an officer. _*On the basis of the order issued by Nair the pujas and the darshan of Ram Lalla continue even now.*_ In 1976, Mr. Nair wanted to return to his hometown. But the people would not allow him to go. However, Nair said goodbye to the people saying that he wanted to be in his hometown during his last days. _*Nair surrendered to the lotus feet of Sri Ramachandra Murthy in his hometown on *7th September 1977*. After hearing of his death the residents of Ayodhya shed tears. A group went to Kerala to receive his ashes üôè _*The ashes were received with great respect. They were taken in a decorated chariot and immersed in the Sarayu river near Ayodhya where Lord Rama bathed daily and worshipped the sun üôè*_ It is only because of Nair‚Äôs efforts that we are able to worship at Sri Rama Janma Bhoomi in Ayodhya. No wonder he is regarded as a *divine person by the people of Ayodhya*. If not for K.K.Nair, it's highly doubtful if Rama's birthplace would have become a grand Ram Temple today. *May the glory of Shri K.K.Nair, who single-handedly preserved the right of Hindus to worship Shri Rama Lalla till today, ring aloud* üôè The *Vishwa Hindu Parishad* has bought land in his native village and erected a memorial for him. It may be noted that a Trust started in the name of K.K Nair provides scholarships and training to students appearing for the civil services examination.üôèüôèüôèüïâÔ∏èüïâÔ∏èüïâÔ∏è We are indebted to them for ever üôèü´°

But this Corona virus is hidden behind the Paranasal sinus of your nose for 3 to 4 days. The hot water we drink does not reach there. After 4 to 5 days this virus that was hidden behind the paranasal sinus reaches your lungs. Then you have trouble breathing. That's why it is very important to take steam, which reaches the back of your Paranasal sinus. You have to kill this virus in the nose with steam. At 50¬∞C, this virus becomes disabled i.e. paralyzed. At 60¬∞C this virus becomes so weak that any human immunity system can fight against it. At 70¬∞C this virus dies completely. This is what steam does. The entire Public Health Department knows this. But everyone wants to take advantage of this Pandemic. So they don't share this information openly. One who stays at home should take steam once a day. If you go to the market to buy Groceries vegetables etc. take it twice a day. Anyone who meets some people or goes to office should take steam 3 times a day. *Steam week* According to doctors, Covid -19 can be killed by inhaling steam from the nose and mouth, eliminating the Coronavirus. If all the people started a steam drive campaign for a week, the pandemic will soon end. So here is a suggestion: * Start the process for a week from morning and evening, for just 5 minutes each time, to inhale steam. If we all adopt this practice for a week the deadly Covid-19 will be erased. This practice has no side effects & doesn't cost anything either. So please send this message to all your Loved Ones, relatives, friends and neighbours, so that we all can kill this Corona virus together and live and walk freely in this beautiful world.

2,606,204	Seven youths from Aurangabad died in a road accident yesterday. The only reason was a car tire burst. An important MSG is that the newly constructed expressway is currently witnessing incidents of vehicle tire bursts. In which many people are losing their lives every day. The question came to my mind that why most accidents happen on the most modern roads in the country? And there is only one mode of accident and that too only by flat tire. What spikes have the builders put on the road so that everyone's tires burst? A storm arose in my mind, I thought I should find out this thing today. So we got together to do some research, we invited a friend to take a Scorpio SUV for testing and we went (note that the real problem is the flat tire) first we checked the cold tire pressure and adjusted it according to international standards which is 25 psi (Air pressure is kept the same in cars of all developed countries When people in our country are not aware of this or they fill the tires with more air than required to save fuel which is usually 35 to 45 PSI. Let's move on now After that we got on four lanes and drove the car, the speed of the car was kept at 120 - 140 km/hr. After driving at such a fast pace for two hours, we reached near Udaipur When we stopped and checked the tire pressure again, we were shocked. Now the tire pressure was 52 psi Now the question arises as to how the tire pressure increased so much Therefore, when a thermometer was placed on the tire, the temperature of the tire was 92.5 degrees Celsius. The whole mystery is now revealed that the air inside the tires expands due to the friction of the tires on the road and the heat generated by the brakes. The air pressure in B2B tires is too high Since the air in our tires is already up to international standards, they are spared from bursting But tires that are already under inflated (35 -45 PSI) Or a tire that has a cut is more likely to explode So get your tire pressure right before heading to the four lanes and enjoy a safe ride I request the Expressway Authority to sensitize the drivers about this so that the journey on the highway does not become one's last journey. Tip.....Instead of air fill the tire with NITROGEN Gas!! This should be done by force. Due to this, if the temperature of the tire increases, the gas inside will not circulate. Nitogen gas has high calorific value.!! (Request all your Facebook and WhatsApp friends to share this post as much as possible.) Even if you save someone's life by doing so, your human birth will be blessed. This important message needs to reach everyone. Thank you from the IIT group. Others can corellate if this is the exact problem ü§î

If *Christians* continue to sell their vote or divide votes or not vote India will be declared a Hindu nation.

The reason for this strict decision is scientific research on the content of the drink and its effect on human health. More than 500 prisoners were chosen in Chinese prisons to conduct experiments and research. They drank Coca-Cola three times a day for six months. The experiment ended with 75 people dying, and 150 people were infected. Others were disabled, and the rest were found to suffer from exacerbation of chronic diseases and have been exposed to health damage of varying degrees of severity... Based on these data, the Authority reached conclusions about the danger of soft drinks to human life and health, which led to a decision to immediately withdraw Coca-Cola from all grocery stores in the Chinese country üá®üá≥...

2,632,241	*CHINA BANNED COCA-COLA FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND CLASSIFIED IT AS CLEANING MATERIAL* In *China*, Coca-Cola will be sold as a sewage cleaner, and the Coca-Cola soft drink produced by the American Coca-Cola Company will be transferred according to the decision of the Chinese Central Committee for Food Quality into the category of sanitary liquids recommended for cleaning pipes... The reason for this strict decision is scientific research on the content of the drink and its effect on human health. More than 500 prisoners were chosen in Chinese prisons to conduct experiments and research. They drank Coca-Cola three times a day for six months. The experiment ended with 75 people dying, and 150 people were infected. Others were disabled, and the rest were found to suffer from exacerbation of chronic diseases and have been exposed to health damage of varying degrees of severity... Based on these data, the Authority reached conclusions about the danger of soft drinks to human life and health, which led to a decision to immediately withdraw Coca-Cola from all grocery stores in the Chinese country üá®üá≥... At the same time, positive properties of the liquid are noted. In particular, in plumbing as an effective cleaner for sewer pipes and toilets in bathrooms, kitchens... In *Turkey*, and for the first time in the world, a trial began against the American company Coca-Cola because of the composition of the drink, which could cause lung, liver, thyroid, and leukemia... In *India*, the Supreme Court banned the distribution of Coca-Cola drinks due to their health risks... *Latvia* banned the distribution of Coca-Cola and Pepsi in primary schools, and in *England* and *Ukraine*, a ban on consuming them was imposed on schools... *‚õî Facts about Coca-Cola*: It is considered good at removing rust, or so-called scale, from the kettle and the plaque in the bathroom, due to the content of orthophosphoric acid in it... In *some Asian countries*, farmers use Coca-Cola to kill insect pests and others because it is cheaper than chemicals, and it gives the same effect... ‚òÖ Every second, 8,000 thousand cups of Coca-Cola drinks are consumed around the world... All of the above does not only apply to Coca-Cola, but all other soft drinks are dangerous, such as Pepsi and other drinks of all kinds... We must remember that manufacturing companies only care about profit and do not care about human health entirely for the purpose of trade. As for taking care of your health, it is in your hands only, so you must abstain from drinking it and advise those around you not to drink it... Indeed, it is delicious to drink because it contains acids, sugars, and chemicals, but at the same time, it is dangerous and deadly and brings cancer, osteoporosis, and early memory loss....

2,637,461	UNION BUDGET - 2024/5 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- 2.45 PM - 1/2/2024 By : Bishwajit Bhattacharyya Ex Additional Solicitor General & Senior Advocate At 11.58 AM Hon‚Äôble FM completed presenting the interim budget. Official figures were uploaded at around 13.15 hours. Far reaching announcements were made concerning economic management. Let figures speak out! Rs.47.65 trillion is the budgeted expenditure for 2024/25. Out of Rs.47.65 trillion, Rs.34.17 trillion will be spent towards non-development expenditure as follows (in trillion rupees) 11.90 (interest payment), 7.68 (establishment expenditure of central government), 4.55 (Defence), 3.80 (Subsidies), 3.85 (Grants in aid of creating capital assets), 2.39 (Pension). These will leave Rs.13.48 trillion (47.65-34.17) towards developmental expenditure. Out of 13.48 trillion rupees, Rs.11.11 trillion will be spent on infrastructure. Thus, a paltry sum of Rs.2.37 trillion will remain for other developmental expenditure! This is barely 0.72 percent of projected GDP of rupees 327 trillion for 2024/5. Thus, we are in dire need of funds to actualise our potential! Interest payment liability has been budgeted at Rs.11.90 trillion, which is far in excess of budgeted capital expenditure for infrastructure - Rs.11.11 trillion. Centre‚Äôs interest liability has increased by 10.18 percent from last year‚Äôs budgeted figure (10.80 trillion rupees to 11.90 in trillion rupees). The situation is grim ! India‚Äôs outstanding internal and external budgeted debt has increased by Rs.15 trillion (169 to 184 trillion rupees) and interest liability on debt has been increased to Rs.11.90 trillion What do these mean ? We are gasping to repay our past debts and still going on borrowing! Establishment expenditure of the Central Government at Rs.7.68 trillion and Pension at Rs.2.39 trillion are highest ever in absolute terms. Should we not trim down establishment expenditure of the central government drastically ? Total tax revenue, net of share of States, is estimated at only Rs.26.01 trillion. Non tax revenue of Rs.3.01 trillion is far from adequate. There is enough scope to boost corporate tax from the budgeted figure of Rs.10.42 trillion. It is shocking to note that personal income tax has been budgeted at 11.56 trillion rupees (9 trillion rupees of last year) indicating an increase of 28.5 percent; but for corporates the budgeted figure is far less - Rs.10.42 trillion - reflecting an increase of only 13% percent (9.22 to 10.42 trillion rupees). This is inequitable. Individuals ought not to be subsidising direct tax to the corporates ! Significantly, budgeted figure of personal income tax (11.56 trillion rupees) far exceeds either corporate tax (10.42) or GST (10.67). I hope policy makers will take note of this anamoly and correct it. Overridingly, the Budgeted Debt (Rs.184 trillion)/GDP (Rs.327 trillion) ratio of 56% does not reflect a rosy situation. It is easy to make loud announcements but we the people must hold those who are spending Rs.47.65 crores of our money accountable! Bishwajit Bhattacharyya Dated : 1.2.2024

I checked on this phone and I was pleasantly surprised by the response by a lady. This centre provides any help / support needed by Senior citizens between 8 am and 8 pm. One can refer to a case of Senior citizens in distress, medical help needed, or protection from harassment, vaccination centres nearby etc. I was very impressed by the person who expressed concern with the promise for immediate help. I would suggest we must share and circulate this information widely to help those in need of help. Please note that the service is available between 8 am to 8 pm only and this service is available in every State except in Haryana and West Bengal, where it has not started as yet but will shortly. Will you please circulate this message to all the Senior citizens in your circle (friends, relatives, neighbours). This is a great initiative taken by the Government of India and will definitely extend benefits to those Senior citizens who are in need of assistance. Very informative, it‚Äôs working. Please share the same in all of your groups.

2,667,679	*What is PERMANENT ADDRESS.....???* *Written by Smt.Nirmala Seetharaman...Very thought provoking!* Our joint family home in Tiruchirapalli housed 14 of us from age 5 to 95 years.All kids,grandkids,Grandparents lived happily by sharing what we had with joy and contentment ... but Today, I watch both the ancestral houses abandoned and nature taking over the garden my mother used to tend for hours every day. The Jamun, the Drumstick, a few Neem and Peepal have survived, but all beauty is both transient and fragile, and the law of entropy is powerful. The lovely flowers of myriad colors are all gone. I wonder what happened to the squirrels, peacock family that came every day and ate from my moms hand. The Bulbul, the sparrows, the parrots, spotted flycatchers, Cuckoos, a huge troop of monkeys that once in a month would upset the order of the place *Once people leave, a home becomes a house*. Initially, I didn‚Äôt feel like selling, and now I don‚Äôt feel like going. Time has taken away ten of its fourteen occupants. I walk around our neighborhood and see similar fate of so many homes once full of life now replaced by Apartments with children Apart,Parents Apart.. omg all crows lying still. Why do we stretch and stress to build houses? In most cases, our kids won‚Äôt need it or worse, fight over it. *What is this human folly of attempting permanent ownership of EMI Apartments in a leased life given by God with an uncertain tenure given by a landlord whose terms are non-negotiable and there is no court of appeal* One day, all we have built with love and EMIs will either be demolished, fought over, sold, or lie in ruins. Every time I fill a form that asks for ‚Äòpermanent address‚Äô I smile at human folly. There is a Zen story that an old monk walked into a King's palace demanding he wanted to spend the night in this Inn and the guards told him, ‚ÄúWhat Inn, can‚Äôt you see its a palace?‚Äù. The monk said ‚ÄúI came here a few decades back. Someone was staying there. A few years later, someone else took the throne from him, then someone else. Any place where the occupant keeps changing is an Inn.‚Äù George Carlin says *‚ÄúHouse is just a place where you keep your stuff as you go out and get more stuff‚Äù.* As houses get bigger, families get smaller. *When the house has occupants, we desire privacy, and when the nest empties, we crave for company.* Birds and Animals must be laughing at us humans who give up living in order to build their dream home and, in the end, depart the Inn they mistook as a Permanent Residence.

2,685,939	A candid article on Kargil by Lt Gen Shahid Aziz, former GOC 4 Corps, Pakistan Army Putting our children in line of fire. By: Shahid Aziz | January 06, 2013 . Kargil, like every other meaningless war that we have fought, brings home lessons we continue to refuse to learn. Instead, we proudly call it our history written in the blood of our children. Indeed, our children penning down our misdeeds with their blood! Medals for some, few songs, a cross road renamed, and of course annual remembrance day and a memorial for those who sacrificed their tomorrow for our today; thus preparing more war fodder for our continuing misadventures. Since nothing went wrong, so there is nothing to learn. We shall do it again. We decide. You die. We sing. Cut off from the reality of pain and affliction that would be brought upon the nation, the decision maker takes the course most suited to his whimsical ambitions. Possible hurdles are sidetracked, on the basis of ‚Äòneed to know‚Äô, or merely bulldozed. Never has there been an institutional decision for the bloodshed. And at the end of each fiasco, original objectives are redefined to cry, ‚ÄúHurrah! We have won‚Äù. Our leaders seek personal glory, and desire honour in the eyes of other nations. Sadly, that has become our definition of national honour; but how can we be respected when we have little self respect? So concerned have we become about how they perceive us that we openly deride our religion and all the social values that we once stood for. The whole truth about Kargil is yet to be known. We await the stories of forgotten starved soldiers hiding behind cold desolate rocks, with empty guns still held in their hands. What stood them there could only be a love higher than that of life. Some refused to withdraw even when ordered, and stayed to fight the proverbial last man last round. Such precious blood spilled without cause! Whatever little I know, took a while to emerge, since General Musharraf had put a tight lid on Kargil. Three years later, a study commenced by GHQ to identify issues of concern at the lowest levels of command, was forcefully stopped by him. ‚ÄúWhat is your intent?‚Äù he asked. His cover-up was revealed many years later, on publication of his book. An unsound military plan based on invalid assumptions, launched with little preparations and in total disregard to the regional and international environment, was bound to fail. That may well have been the reason for its secrecy. It was a total disaster. The question then arises why was it undertaken? Were there motives other than those proclaimed, or was it only a blunder, as I had assumed for many years? It certainly wasn‚Äôt a defensive manoeuvre. There were no indications of an Indian attack. We didn‚Äôt pre-empt anything; nothing was on the cards. I was then heading the Analysis Wing of Inter Services Intelligence and it was my job to know. Our clearly expressed intent was to cut the supply line to Siachen and force the Indians to pull out. This was not a small result we sought and cannot be classified as a tactical manoeuvre, where no one other than the local commander needed to be aware. General Musharraf himself writes, ‚Äú800 sq kms of area was captured.... and it created strategic effects‚Äù. To say that occupying empty spaces along the Line of Control was not a violation of any agreement and came under the purview of the local commander is astounding. This area was with the Indians as a result of Simla Agreement, and there had been no major violation of the Line of Control since 1971. The entire planning and execution was done in a cavalier manner, in total disregard of military convention. In justification, to say that our assessment was not wrong, but there was, ‚Äúunreasonably escalated Indian response‚Äù is a sorry excuse for not being able to assess Indian reaction. Assumptions were made that they would not be able to dislodge us and the world would sit back idly. There were no mujahideen, only taped wireless messages, which fooled no one. Our soldiers were made to occupy barren ridges, with hand held weapons and ammunition. There was no way to dig in, so they were told to make parapets with lose stones and sit behind them, with no overhead protection. The boys were comforted by their commander‚Äôs assessment that no serious response would come. But it did ‚Äî wave after wave, supported by massive air bursting artillery and repeated air attacks. The enemy still couldn‚Äôt manage to capture the peaks, and instead filled in the valleys. Cut off and forsaken, our posts started collapsing one after the other, though the general publicly denied it. The gung-ho mannerism, when there were no pressures, was cowed when lines started shrinking and the international setting became frightening. There was no will to stay the course. Media was hushed to silence, so that pulling out does not become a political issue. We will sing when our songs don‚Äôt tie us down. The operation, in any case, didn‚Äôt have the capacity to choke Siachen. When this truth surfaced, the initial aim was quickly modified. Now the book reads, ‚ÄúI would like to state emphatically that whatever movement has taken place so far in the direction of finding a solution to Kashmir is due considerably to the Kargil conflict.‚Äù Glory be to the victors. We continue to indulge in bloody enterprises, under the hoax of safeguarding national interest. How many more medals will we put on coffins? How many more songs are we to sing? And how many more martyrs will our silences hide? If there is purpose to war then yes, we shall all go to the battle front, but a war where truth has to be hidden, makes one wonder whose interest is it serving? It must be Allah‚Äôs country, for who else is holding it afloat?! The writer is a retired lieutenant general and former corps commander of Lahore. Email: azizshahid10@gmail.com Blog:

My grandmom brought us up. ""Soon after, when my mother remarried, the boys at school started saying all kinds of things about us. But our grandmother taught us to retain dignity at all costs, a value that‚Äôs always stayed with me. It involved walking away from these situations instead of fighting back. ""And if it weren‚Äôt for grandmom, I wouldn‚Äôt be half the person I am today. ""My father and I couldn‚Äôt agree on the same thing ‚Äì I wanted to go to college in the US, he insisted on UK. I wanted to be an architect, he insisted on me becoming an engineer. If it weren‚Äôt for my grandmother, I wouldn‚Äôt have ended up at Cornell University in the US. It was because of her that even though I enrolled for mechanical engineering, I switched majors & graduated with a degree in architecture. My father was upset, but I was finally my own, independent person in college & it was my grandmother who taught me that courage to speak up can also be soft. ""After college, I landed a job at an architecture firm in LA, where I worked for 2 years. It was a great time ‚Äì the weather was beautiful & I loved my job. It was in LA that I fell in love & almost got married. But at the same time I‚Äôd made the decision to move back, at least temporarily, since grandmom wasn‚Äôt keeping too well. So I came back to visit her & thought that the person I wanted to marry would come to India with me, but because of the 1962 Indo-China war her parent‚Äôs weren‚Äôt okay with her making the move anymore & the relationship fell apart. ""After the move, I did spend some time with my grandmom. I‚Äôd run with my dog, catch up with her & we‚Äôd have long chats. I‚Äôm glad I got that time with her before she passed, because right after I moved to Jamshedpur for an internship at what‚Äôs known as Tata Motors now. It was a waste of time ‚Äì I was moved from one department to another & since I was a family member, no one told me what to do ‚Äì I spent 6 months trying to be ‚Äòuseful‚Äô. ""It was only after I moved to Tata Steel that I got specific work & my job got interesting. I started from the floor & understood the plight of those working there. So years later, when we downsized Tata Steel from 78,000 to 40,000, we ensured to pay them their present day wages until retirement‚Äìit‚Äôs been in our DNA to serve those who serve us. ""Then, in 1991, JRD stepped down as the Chairman of Tata Industries and then from Tata Sons, there was vicious criticism. There were other aspirants, who were vocal of him having made the wrong decision. I had been through this before, so I did what I knew best‚Äìmaintained silence & focused on proving myself. The criticism was personal‚ÄìJRD got clubbed with nepotism & I, as the wrong choice. I was under scrutiny, but the time I spent on the floor served as a big plus ‚Äì I hadn‚Äôt gotten there from nowhere! ""All in all, it was a big move. I remember after I was appointed Chairman, I walked with JRD to his office, where he told his secretary that he had to move out. I said, ‚ÄòNo, J, don‚Äôt move out, this is your office for as long as you want.‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòWhere will you sit?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòWhere I‚Äôm sitting today‚ÄìI have an office down the hall & that‚Äôs fine.‚Äô ""I was lucky to have him there. He was my greatest mentor & the years that he was alive, I used to go into his office & say, ‚ÄòJ, I wish this had happened 10 years ago, we have such a great relationship.‚Äô He was like a father & a brother to me & not enough‚Äôs been said about that. ""Ever since, my life has been for & about growing the company. When I was appointed Chairman, it was believed my surname got me the position, but my focus was on creating something bigger than us all & on giving back, which has been in the TATA DNA since the start. With Jamshedpur for instance, while our workers were thriving, the surrounding villages were suffering. It became our goal to uplift their quality of life as well ‚Ä¶ things like these came naturally to us. ""Even with the Nano ‚Äì I remember seeing a family of 4 on a bike in the heavy Bombay rain‚ÄîI wanted to do more for these families who were risking their lives for lack of an alternative. By the time we launched the Nano, our costs were higher, but I‚Äôd made a promise & we delivered. Looking back, I‚Äôm proud of the car & the decision to go ahead with it. ""That‚Äôs what my life has been about‚Äîwork became a lifestyle. I was always at Bombay House or travelling, that‚Äôs why even though I came close to marriage with 2-3 different partners, I couldn‚Äôt go through with it because they‚Äôd have to adjust to my lifestyle & that didn‚Äôt sit right with me. ""Now that I‚Äôm retired, that lifestyle has changed again. People ask if I‚Äôm truly ‚Äòretired‚Äô & to that I say‚Äîthere‚Äôs no doubt about it. I‚Äôm enjoying the separation from the company‚ÄîI don‚Äôt look at newspapers & worry about the bad stuff anymore. ""But let me tell you, retirement isn't about playing golf, or reading on a beach, whilst sipping on a cocktail. In fact, never before has the urge to do more, been greater. From affordable cancer treatment, to making the lives in rural India easier‚ÄîI‚Äôm looking forward to making it happen at the Tata Trust. I‚Äôm trying to enjoy myself to be honest‚Äî I‚Äôm spending time with friends ‚Äîold & new, across age groups, who I‚Äôm constantly learning from. ""At 82, I‚Äôm still learning, so when you ask me to give advice, I feel like the ‚Äòright advice‚Äô changes over a period of time‚Äîbut the one thing that remains unchanged is the desire to do the right thing. ""So I‚Äôll say this ‚Äîleave the advice & do the right thing, even if it isn‚Äôt the easiest thing to do. When you look back at your life, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to matter the most. Doing the right thing.‚Äù *# RatanTata* MUST MUST READ"

He tells the Loan Officer that he was going to India for some business for 2 weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The Loan Officer tells him that the bank will need Some form of security for the loan. So the Indian man hands over the keys and the documents of the new Ferrari car parked on the street in front of the bank. The loan officer consults the president of the bank, Produces all the required items and everything checks out to be OK. The loan officer agrees to accept the car as a security for the loan. The bank president and the Loan Officer had a good laugh at the Indian..... For keeping a $750,000 Ferrari as a security and taking only $5,000 as a loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Ferrari Into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the Indian returns promptly and pays $5000 and the interest which comes to *$15.41*. Seeing this, the loan officer says, ‚ÄúSir, we are very happy to have your business And this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you are away, we checked you out and Found out that you were a multi millionaire ! What puzzled us was why would you bother to borrow $5000?‚Äù The Indian replies ""Where else in the New York City can I park my car for 2 weeks and For just $15.41 and expect it to be safely there when I return"". This is a true incident and It is said that the Indian is none other than Vijay Malya ! üòä"

Amit Vaidya lived the American dream.¬†A Gujarati, born and brought up in the US, with a Ph.D. in economics, he worked in the entertainment industry‚Äôs business department. ‚ÄúIt was an active but not a healthy lifestyle as I was an overachiever,‚Äù says Amit. His dreams ‚Äúwere shattered‚Äù¬†when a few months after his father‚Äôs death he was diagnosed¬†with first stage gastric cancer.¬†‚ÄúThe fall was great as I had risen to great heights when I was 27.‚Äù Opting not to do surgery,¬†he went in for ‚Äúaggressive chemo radiation‚Äù in New York.¬†Two years later he went into remission. Within two months of his recovery,¬†his mother was diagnosed with grade three brain tumour.¬†‚ÄúNothing worked and I lost her too. Away in a foreign land, being the only child, I felt lonely and a scan showed my cancer had returned after 18 months. This time it showed up in my liver. Nine months later, in 2011, reports showed I was not responding to treatment and the cancer had spread to my lungs too,‚Äù he says emotionally.¬† Doctors told Amit that his life too was just a matter of time.¬†‚ÄúNot wanting to burden my friends, I started planning my funeral. Soon he planned a trip to India. An aunt also told me about an Ayurvedic hospital in Gujarat that claims to cure cancer in 11 days for just a rupee!¬†Having nothing to lose I wanted to give it a shot.‚Äù So off he went and explains that the treatment was disciplined with yoga, meditation and he was made to drink a mix of _‚Äúdesi cow milk, curd, ghee and gobar, go-mutra. I was to drink it on an empty stomach. For years everything tasted like saw dust because of the chemo. It was easy to drink something that smelled and tasted as it should. Others there were traumatised by this. I kept faith and did it diligently. I saw no change but felt no worse either.‚Äù_ Scans showed that the cancer ‚Äúhad not spread‚Äù. Amit then went back to the hospital and lived there for another 40 days. Reports showed the cancer had decreased. ‚ÄúWanting to continue the therapy,‚Äù Amit stayed with a farmer, who opened his house to Amit. _‚ÄúHe offered me a tiny shack on his farm, a cot, a goshala with desi cows, a well and a toilet.¬†I continued the therapy and after months was able to walk. Over time, walks became jogs, jogs became runs and I started finding joy in my mind. The villagers had time for me, which was the best gift I got, especially when I needed time to heal.‚Äù_ After 18 months Amit claims he is cancer free and decided _‚Äúon planning to live his life instead of planning a funeral.¬†I now talk to people about my journey and that healing is possible. I make time to spend with cancer patients. It is all free.¬†I have started an NGO called Healing Vaidya.‚Äù_ He does not plan on going back to the US as _‚Äúthis country, my India, has given me much. I have learnt that people here don‚Äôt value what it can offer.‚Äù_ Amit has written¬†""Holy Cancer - How A Cow Saved My Life"" (Aditya Prakashan, Rs. 495)¬†which was launched in the city recently.

2,747,245	"READ THIS ARTICLE FULLY. YOU ARE IN FOR SURPRISES... *Know Christian Leaders of India* (Hidden under the guise of Hindu name) Arvind Kejriwal is not a Hindu but a Crypto Christian. He got converted to Christianity while working with Mother Teresa. He was also allowed to go to that part of the Vatican, where only Christians can go. When Mother Teresa was being given the title of saint, then the Vatican had invited only Arvind Kejriwal from among the Chief Ministers of the whole of India. The word 'crypto' in Greek means hidden or secret. ""Crypto Christian"" means Secret-Christian...! The important aspects in this are: *Crypto-christian is not an abusive or negative word. Crypto-Christianity is an institutional practice of Christianity in a country in which Christians live under the basic principle of crypto-Christianity. There they worship the God of that country as a show, follow the religion that country which is their camouflage. But in reality they are Christians inside and continue to preach Christianity continuously. *The earliest examples of crypto Christians are found in the Roman Empire when Christianity had set its feet in Rome in the early stages. The great Roman emperor Trajan immediately saw Christianity as a threat to Roman culture as many Romans had become Christians. He proposed to them, ""either leave Christianity or suffer the death penalty"". Roman Christians pretended to leave Christianity to avoid the death penalty. And after that they continued to worship Roman Gods and Goddesses superficially. But they believed in Christianity from inside. *This is similar to the Muslims when they are 5-10 percent. Then follow the laws of that country. But when they are 20-30 percent, the demand for Shariat begins. Riots happen. Ethnic cleansing of non-Muslims starts as the population increases further. *But crypto Christians do not commit violence like Muslims. When Crypto Christian is less than 1 percent, he keeps doing his work by adopting the God of that country. As and when they become more in number, they start insulting the same deities. Hollywood's famous film Agora (2009) every Hindu must see. It shows, how when crypto Christians became more in number in Rome, they started insulting Roman Gods and Goddesses. *At present, in India also crypto Christians have taken hold. So, here also the work of abusing Hindu deities, Brahmins has started. Means, the work which happened 2000 years ago in Europe is happening today in India. *Recently Professor Kedar Mandal called Goddess Durga as a prostitute. *There are many such crypto -Christians in India.They are amongst us, wearing the mask of secularism, leftism and Buddhism.The Christian population in India is officially 20 million. And it will not be surprising if 100 million Christians come out in India. The estimated Christian population in Punjab alone is above 10 percent. Many Christians of Punjab are under the camouflage of Sikhism, wear a turban. They also wear beard, kirpan, kada, and follow Sikhism. But they are all secret-Christians. *Many crypto-Christians have Hindu names to take reservation. In these, the names of many are on Gods like Ram, Krishna, Shiva, Durga etc; whom even the people of the Sangh cannot understand as non-Hindu even in dreams. *Former President K R Narayanan was a crypto-christian, who was a Dalit throughout his life for receiving all the benefits of reservation. And when he died, we saw the process of burial according to Christianity. *So understood that this is crypto-Christian. There are many such crypto-Christians in the country. Those who are only increasing the agenda of Vatican by attacking Hinduism in Hindu names. We see such crypto-Christians every day in everyday life. But they can't be understood as they hide under the camouflage of Hindu names. *Congress leader Ambika Soni, who described Shri Ram as fictional, is a crypto Christian. Most of NDTV's staff are crypto-Christians. *The Naxalites with Hindu names who killed Swami Lakshmanananda are crypto Christians. Gauri Lankesh, who had posted pictures of Brahmins being thrown out of Kerala on her Facebook profile, was a crypto Christian. *Those who raised slogans of 'Bidding India' in JNU and then the Indian Government's action against them as brahminical atrocities are not the Left, but crypto-Christians. *Khalistani Sikhs who abuse Brahmins on Facebook, call Hanuman a monkey, Ganesh an elephant are crypto-Christians. *There are crypto Christians in Tamil Nadu who have attacked North Indians by hiding their Dravidian identity. *There are crypto Christians who oppose Hindi in Bengal, the state which gave maximum number of Hindi singers. *Narendra Dabholkar was a crypto-Christian, running an agenda against Hindu festivals in the name of superstition, but sacrificing innocent animals on Bakrid and dead man Jesus being alive on Easter. *Dilip C Mandal, who speaks day and night against Brahmins on Facebook, Vaman Meshram are crypto-Christians. *Many Yadavs like Jitendra Yadav and Sunil Janardan Yadav, who claim Mahishasur as their ancestor, are crypto-Christians hidden in surnames. *Tamil actor Vijay is a crypto-Christian whose full name is Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar. *Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashish Khaitan is a crypto-Christian. His wife's name is Cristinia Lydia Fernandes and their children are Christians. *The leftist leader is D Raja is a crypto-Christian. His real name is Daniel King. *Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy is a crypto Christian. He believes in Christianity. *Former Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Ajit Jogi was a Christian. And his whole family is Christian. *Congress leader Manish Tewari is a crypto Christian. (Congress spokesperson Shobha Ojha is a crypto Christian.)People came to know about it when his mother was buried with full Christian customs. Her name was Sarmma Thomas. *Similarly, there are thousands of Hindu Namdharis around us. Which is actually crypto christian. Arvind Kejriwal once said while describing Christianity, that he is running the Delhi Government on the ideals of Jesus in full Christian customs. Because he believes them. When the Delhi government had organized a fake healing program by calling a crooked Christian priest at government expense, Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia themselves went on stage where the Christian priest was allegedly healing the people with diseases like deafness and cancer by merely touching them... ü§î This is another epidemic that is slowly engulfing our nation.. üòî. *Editor D'Souza*"

2,763,035	"C O C O N U T In the United States, an estimated 5.4 million people have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. This figure is growing rapidly with the ageing population. One of them was Steve Newport. His wife, Mary Newport, was a doctor. Dr. Mary learned that her husband had severe Alzheimer's disease. When the doctor examined her husband at the hospital, he asked Steve to paint a clock. Instead, he drew a few circles and then drew a few figures without any logic. It was not like a clock at all!. The doctor pulled her aside and said: ""Your husband is already on the verge of severe Alzheimer's disease!"" It turned out that it was a test of whether a person had Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Mary was very upset at that time, but as a doctor, she would not just give up. She began to study the disease. She found out Alzheimers disease was associated to glucose deficiency to the brain. Her research says: ""The dementia of the elderly is like having diabetes in the head! Before one has the symptoms of Diabetes or Alzheimer's disease, the body has already had problems for 10 to 20 years."" According to Dr. Mary's study, Alzheimer's disease is very similar to Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The cause is also insulin imbalance. Because insulin has a problem, it prevents the brain cells from absorbing glucose. Glucose is the nutrition of brain cells. Without glucose, brain cells die. As it turns out, these high-quality proteins are the cells that feed our body. But nutrition for our brain cell is glucose. As long as we have mastered the source of these two kinds of food, we are the masters of our own health! The next question is, where to find glucose? It cannot be the ready-made glucose that we buy from the store. It is not from fruits such as grapes. She started looking for alternatives. The alternative nutrients for brain cells are ketones. Ketones are necessary in brain cells. Ketones cannot be found in vitamins. *Coconut oil* contains triglicerides. After the triglycerides in *coconut oil* is consumed, it is metabolised into ketones in the liver. This is the alternative nutrient for brain cells! After this scientific verification, Dr. Mary added *coconut oil* to her husband's food. After only two weeks, when he went to the hospital again to do painting and clock tests, the progress was amazing. Dr. Mary said: ""At that time, I thought, has God heard my prayers? Wouldn't it be coconut oil that worked? But there is no other way. Anyway, it's better to continue taking the *coconut oil*."" Dr. Mary was now part of the traditional medical practice base. She clearly knew the capabilities of traditional medicine. Three weeks later, the third time she took him to do a smart clock test, the performance was better than the last time. This progress was not only intellectual, but also emotional and physical. Dr. Mary said: ""He could not do his running but now he can run. He could not read for a year and a half, but he can read again now after taking *coconut oil* for three months."" Her husband's actions had already begun to change. He did not speak in the mornings. Now she noticed a lot of changes: ""Now after he gets up, he is spirited, talking and laughing. He drinks water himself and takes utensils for himself on his own."" On the surface, these are very simple daily tasks, but only those who have come to the clinic or have demented relatives at home can experience the joy: It is not easy to see such progress! After frying the greens & onions in coconut oil, making cakes with coconut, after taking 3 to 4 tablespoons of coconut oil per meal, 2-3 months later, the eyes too can now focus normally. Her studies proved that *coconut oil* can really improve the problem of dementia in the elderly. Apply *coconut oil* to bread. When coconut cream is used, the taste is unexpectedly good. Young people can also use it for maintenance of health and prevention, and can improve if they have symptoms of dementia. Dementia is caused because nutrients cannot be transported to brain cells, and nutrients must be passed from the body to the brain by insulin. Especially for diabetic patients it's not easy to get insulin secretion. ‚ÄúNutrition cannot get to the brain. When brain cells are starved to death, they are deprived of intelligence.‚Äù *Coconut oil* contains medium-chain triglyceride, which can supply nutrients to the brain without using insulin. *So, it can improve Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.* After reading the article, don't forget to share it. *Found this interesting and Helpful as we are getting Old in Age.. Someone could need this. Thanks.üôè ~~~~Forwarded~~~~ *üëåüèºGOOD AND VERY USEFUL ARTICLE FOR EVERY AGE. READ THIS PATIENTLY & SHARE ITüëç*"

2,796,519	EXCELLENT PIECE - I love it. This is a beautiful article from New York Times.While many of our own papers and tv channels deplore India, here is a view from THE INDIAN ELECTIONS - NEW YORK TIMES It is truly the greatest show on Earth, an ode to a diverse & democratic ethos, where 700 million + of humanity vote, providing their small part in directing their ancient civilization into the future. It is no less impressive when done in a neighborhood which includes de-stabilizing & violent Pakistan, China, and Burma. It's challenges are immense, more so probably than anywhere else, particularly in development & fending off terrorism -- but considering these challenges & its neighbors, it is even more astounding that the most diverse nation on Earth, with hundreds of languages, all religions & cultures, is not only surviving, but thriving. The nation: where Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism & Sikhism were born, which is the second largest Muslim nation on Earth; where Christianity has existed for 2000 years; where the oldest Jewish synagogues & Jewish communities have resided since the Romans burnt their 2nd temple; where the Dalai Lama & the Tibetan government in exile reside; where the Zoroastrians from Persia have thrived since being thrown out of their ancient homeland; where Armenians, Syrians & many others have come to live; where the Paris-based OECD said was the largest economy on Earth for 1500 of the last 2000 years, including the 2nd largest, only 200 years ago; where 3 Muslim Presidents have been elected, where a Sikh was Prime Minister & the head of the ruling party a Catholic Italian woman, where the past President was also a woman, succeeding a Muslim President who as a rocket scientist is a hero in the nation; where a booming economy is lifting 40 million out of poverty each year & is expected to have the majority of its population in the middle class already, equal to the entire US population, by 2025; where its optimism & vibrancy is manifested in its movies, arts, economic growth & voting, despite all the incredible challenges & hardships; where all the great powers are vying for influence, as it itself finds its place in the world. Where all of this is happening, is India and as greater than 1/7th of humanity gets ready to vote, it is an inspiration to the entire World. ‚Äî V Mitchell, New York, NY

It was truly heartening to watch her begin her speech in Telugu and conclude it with a prayer in Sanskrit - a wonderful example of how one could attain success in life and also remain rooted in culture. Her appointment is yet another testament to the growing prowess of Indian-origin people across the world. I congratulate her and wish her a successful tenure. May she continue to uphold justice and further strengthen people's faith in the judiciary with her wisdom.

Some goons made lewd remarks against the women & tried to molest them. The Army Officers chased the goons who took shelter in a nearby Cinema Theatre.* _The matter was reported to the Commanding Officer Col Jyothi Mohan Sen. On learning about the incident, the Col. ordered the Cinema Hall to be surrounded by troops. All the goons were dragged out, the leader of the goons was heady and drunk with power; who was none other than the son of the then Chief Minister of Punjab, Pratap Singh Kairon, the close associate of the then PM, Jawahar Lal Nehru._ _All the goons were stripped to their underwear, paraded in the streets of Amritsar & later interned in the Cantonment. Next day, the Chief Minister became furious & tried to release his son from Indian Army's incarceration._ You know what happened ? *_His vehicle was not allowed to go in to the Cantonment as VIP Vehicle, he was compelled to walk all the way to meet the Colonel.

2,860,435	"When Nalanda University was inaugurated by PM Modi yesterday, we must also remember what happened with this same University under PM Manmohan Singh in the UPA Era! Read on....... When UPA government inaugurated Nalanda University in Bihar in 2007, Amartya Sen was made the first Chancellor of the university. A very important feature of his appointment was that he had all powers in the name of ""autonomy"". So much so that he did not even have to provide the account of money spent on anything to the government. Imagine a public servant spending any amount of taxpayers' money and yet exempt from any kind of accountability. Not only that, he was drawing a salary of ‚Çπ 5 lakh per month - a university chancellor of a government university drawing a salary more than any other public servant. Apart from that, he had unlimited foreign trips allowances on taxpayers money by the virtue of being Nalanda University Chancellor. The story doesn't end here. During the 7 years (2007-2014), Amartya Sen spent ‚Çπ 2730 Crore on a university which still was not fully functional. Yes, a whopping ‚Çπ 2730 CRORE. Since it was by law (made by UPA) exempt from any kind of accountability, we can never know what happened to that money and yet it will remain legal. Now, coming to appointments. Even appointments made by Amartya Sen were exempt from any kind of accountability. So who did he appoint ? The first 4 faculties were : 1. Dr. Upinder Singh 2. Anjana Sharma 3. Nayanjot Lahiri 4. Gopa Sabharwal. Who were they ? Dr. Upinder Singh is the Daughter of former PM Manmohan Singh. The other 3 are close associates/friends of Dr. Upinder Singh. Amartya Sen then appointed 2 more ""GUEST"" faculties- 1. Daman Singh 2. Amrit Singh Who are they ? Middle and youngest DAUGHTER of ex-PM Manmohan Singh. What's unique about the appointment of Daman Singh and Amrit Singh is that they remained in the US all along 7 years. But were drawing a huge salary as a guest faculty. What salary they were drawing, only God knows. The reason, again, is that Nalanda University had been made exempt from any kind of accountability to government. So, the summary 1. The University had hardly one building. 2. It had just 7 faculty members & a few guest faculties (who NEVER came) - all relatives/friends of Manmohan Singh/Amartya Sen. 3. There were hardly a hundred students. 4. There was no expenses on costly reagents or equipments as no scientific research was going on. 5. Still, the expenses was ‚Çπ 2730 Crore. In short, Amartya Sen had access to unlimited government fund without any accountability. When Narendra Modi came to know about what all was going in the name of university, he kicked this leech out of the university in 2015 and cancelled all the appointments he had made. Amartya Sen had splurged more than ‚Çπ 2700 Crore on himself and his associates. He lived in US and was drawing 5 Lakh per month and enjoying all allowances from India's taxpayers' money without doing anything. Just because someone is a Nobel laureate doesn't mean that he is totally clean or doesn't have any ulterior intention. Nobel prize or a big degree is no indication of people's nature. Even Manmohan had a PhD degree. That didn't mean he was the best in governance. His government turned out to be the worst in India's independent history. We can never take action against Amartya Sen or technically call him corrupt because he was merely following the ""rules"" and the rules had been made in such a way by the UPA Government that he had the powers to spend as much he wanted without being accountable. That's why he will remain protected and can never be dragged to court. This was a LEGALISED PLUNDER of ‚Çπ 2730 Crore by Amartya Sen. ."

2,867,605	Is the below true? When more than 90,000 Pakistani soldiers were in Indian custody and more than 3,000 of their military officers were in our custody...Pakistan's army had surrendered. The Indian army had annexed Sindh's Tharparkar district to India and it was declared a new district of Gujarat and the tricolour flag was hoisted on the Muzaffarabad Parliament. When Zulfikar Ali Bhutto came to Shimla to negotiate with Indira Gandhi, he also brought his daughter Benazir Bhutto along with him. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was teaching politics to his daughter. Indira Gandhi put a condition before Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, if you want your 93000 soldiers back then you give us Kashmir. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto told Indira Gandhi that we will not give you Kashmir. I will not sign anything, you keep these 93000 soldiers with yourself. Indira Gandhi had not even dreamed that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was a bigger player than her. He knew how to win the war lost on the borders on the table. Indira Gandhi's condition had become such that if someone goes to fast and then Namaz falls on her neck. Pupul Jayakar and Kuldeep Nayyar both have written in their book that Indira Gandhi missed that opportunity and she and her advisors did not have any diplomatic knowledge about how to handle the situation. Under the Geneva Convention, if a country captures a prisoner of war, then it has to take full care of his dignity. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto told his daughter Benazir Bhutto in the hotel in the evening that India's back has been broken in this war. We fought bravely even though we caused a severe blow to India's economy. India has already borne the burden of Bangladeshi refugees. Now how will India accommodate 93000 Pakistani soldiers and if India wants to accommodate 93000 Pakistani soldiers, then accommodate them. And what will we do by taking back those cowardly soldiers? I have made Indira Gandhi's condition like a mole in a snake's neck. And in the end, Indira Gandhi's condition became such that someone eats shoes and also onions. Indira Gandhi also gave Kashmir to Pakistan, returned 93,000 soldiers and left 56 of her soldiers to die in Pakistani jails. And after 8 months, in the desire of Nobel Prize, Tharparkar district included in Gujarat state of India was returned to Pakistan even though 98% of the population of Tharparkar at that time was Hindu. After the Shimla Agreement, the then Army Chief had said in the book he wrote after retirement that we won this war on the battlefield but the politicians at the table defeated India. And that politician was Indira Gandhi.

2,868,877	Why did Jawaharlal Nehru have so many affairs? Nehru's numerous affairs are well known. Many don't know that the person whose birthday is credited as a Children's Day abandoned his love child. It started this way: The opposition to the Congress the Hindu Mahasabha wanted an appointment with Nehru but Nehru treated them with disdain. So knowing Nehru's weakness for beauty they requested Nehru to meet a 28 year old sadhvi Shraddhamata whom Nehru instantly agreed to meet. Although this meeting with Nehru was supposed to be scheduled for 15 mins only, Shraddhamata managed to extend the meeting for 3 hours. Soon Nehru started meeting Shraddhamata more and more often, they had an affair and one day Shraddhamata came at his doorstep with their baby. A furious Nehru had nothing to do with the child, so Shraddhamata had no other option but to send the child to a convent (reference- M.O Mathai, Secretary to Nehru for 15 years book Reminiscences of the Nehru Era). History goes that he was married to Kamla Nehru early against his wishes and hence had numerous affairs in later life most famously with Edwina, Padmaja Naidu and Shraddhamata (1 illegitimate child which he abandoned)- reference M.O Mathai- Reminiscences of the Nehru Era). Nehru had syphilis in his last years of life.

2,873,945	Major Anuj Sood's family was denied benefits by Maharashtra Govt.
2,876,328	Major Anuj Sood had been residing in Pune with his family since 2005. He was martyred on May 2, 2020, while fighting terrorists in Handwara, Kupwara district of Jammu and Kashmir. Major Sood was only 30 years old when he sacrificed his life for the country. He was posthumously awarded the Shaurya Chakra for his bravery. Sadly, the benefits and allowances given to the families of martyred soldiers were denied to Major Sood's wife by the state government, citing that although they had lived in Maharashtra for over 15 years, they were originally from another state. In response to this injustice, Major Sood‚Äôs wife approached the Bombay High Court. A few months ago, during a hearing, the court expressed dissatisfaction with the government's policy and suggested that the government should view this case positively as a special matter. However, the Shinde government continued to delay, citing policy decisions. Frustrated, the court finally told the Chief Minister directly that if he was unable to make a decision, he should state this in an affidavit, and the court would then take appropriate action. The court, comprising Justice Girish Kulkarni and Justice Firdaus Pooniwala, reprimanded the government, stating that the attitude of delaying rightful claims of the family of a soldier who sacrificed his life for the country was unacceptable. Eventually, after significant pressure and stern remarks from the court, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde approved the matter as a special case. Yesterday, the same Chief Minister sanctioned a prize of 11 crores rupees for Team India's players in one go. The question of whether all these players were originally from Maharashtra did not arise. It's disturbing to see a government that makes the family of a martyred soldier approach the court for their rightful entitlements, while generously disbursing crores from the state treasury to already wealthy cricketers without hesitation.

2,887,808	"IRDAI Removes Age Limits on Health Insurance Purchase In a ground-breaking development, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has ushered in a new era in the health insurance sector. With the recent announcement, the regulatory body has eliminated the cap on buying health insurance policies, marking a significant departure from the conventional constraints that often limited individuals in securing comprehensive coverage. This shift holds profound implications for both insurers and policyholders. By abolishing the maximum age restriction on purchasing health insurance plans, IRDAI aims to foster a more inclusive and accessible healthcare ecosystem, ensuring adequate protection against unforeseen medical expenses. Furthermore, this move is poised to stimulate innovation within the insurance sector. Insurers are now incentivised to diversify their product offerings, catering to a broader spectrum of healthcare requirements. Until now, individuals were limited to purchasing a new insurance policy only until the age of 65. However, with the recent changes that have come into effect from April 01, 2024, anyone, regardless of age, is eligible to purchase a new health insurance Furthermore, the insurance regulatory authority has urged health insurance providers to introduce tailored policies aimed at specific demographics, such as senior citizens. Additionally, insurers have been instructed to establish dedicated channels to handle health insurance claims and grievances specifically for senior citizens. In a notification published in the Gazette, IRDAI stated, ""Insurers shall ensure that they offer health insurance products to cater to all age groups. Insurers may design products specifically for senior citizens, students, children, maternity, and any other group as specified by the Competent Authority."" Moreover, insurers have been mandated to offer health policies to individuals with pre-existing medical conditions of any kind. Consequently, insurers are prohibited from refusing to issue policies to individuals with severe medical conditions like cancer, heart or renal failure, AIDS Here Are Recent Notable Amendments in Health Insurance: Life insurance companies have the option to launch extended health policies lasting up to five years, whereas general insurers and standalone health insurers are limited to offering policies for a maximum period of three years. IRDAI has decreased the health insurance waiting period from 48 months to 36 months. According to the insurance regulator, all pre-existing conditions should be covered after 36 months, regardless of whether the policyholder disclosed them initially or not. Put simply, health insurers are prohibited from rejecting claims based on pre-existing conditions after these 36 months. IRDAI clarified that insurers cannot contest claims after 60 months of continuous coverage. After completing sixty consecutive months of coverage, including portability and migration, insurers cannot challenge policies or claims due to non-disclosure or misrepresentation, except in cases of established fraud. Life insurers are barred from introducing indemnity-based health policies, which compensate for hospital expenses. Instead, they are only permitted to provide benefit-based policies, offering fixed costs upon the occurrence of a covered disease. Life insurers have the liberty to bundle health plans with ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans). Premium adjustments during the policy term are prohibited. For instance, if a customer pays a two-year premium in advance, insurers cannot demand additional payments throughout the policy tenure. However, premium adjustments based on factors like age and risk are allowed at the time of renewal. Insurers are allowed to offer premium payment in instalments for the convenience of policyholders. Travel policies can only be offered by general and health insurers. There is no limit on AYUSH treatment coverage. Treatments under systems like Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy will receive coverage up to the sum insured without any cap. Policyholders with benefit-based policies can file multiple claims with various insurers, enhancing flexibility and options. The proposed regulation seeks to handle the complaints and claims of senior citizens via a specialised channel, ensuring a more tailored and responsive approach to their requirements. ] To conclude: The recent initiatives by IRDAI mark a significant leap forward in India's health insurance sector. By removing age restrictions on purchasing policies, reducing waiting periods for pre-existing conditions, and mandating coverage for various medical treatments, the regulatory body has paved the way for more inclusive and accessible healthcare. These measures not only empower individuals to secure comprehensive coverage tailored to their needs but also encourage insurers to innovate and diversify their product offerings. Furthermore, directives aimed at streamlining processes, such as simplified renewals and dedicated channels for senior citizens, underscore IRDAI's commitment to enhancing customer experience and addressing the evolving needs of policyholders. As the industry embraces these changes, it is poised to foster greater trust, transparency, and efficiency, ultimately advancing the overarching goal of ensuring financial protection and well-being for all segments of society."

The passenger next to me was elderly gentleman dressed in a simple shirt and pants. He appeared to be middle class, and well educated. Other passengers perhaps recognising who I was, but this gentleman appeared to be unconcerned of my presence... He was reading his paper, looking out of the window, and when tea was served, he sipped it quietly. Trying to strike a conversation with him I smiled. The man courteously smiled back and said 'Hello'. We got talking and I brought up the subject of cinema and movies and asked, 'Do you watch films?' The man replied, 'Oh, very few. I did see one many years ago.' I mentioned that I worked in the movie industry. The man replied.."" oh, that's nice. What do you do?' I replied, 'I am an actor ' The man nodded, 'Oh, that's wonderful!' And that was it... When we landed, I held out my hand and said, "" It was good to travel with you.

2,908,105	Title: The Silenced Voices of Bangladesh: A Student's Cry for Justice By: [Promit], Bangladeshi Student and Protester As a student of Bangladesh, I stand today as a voice among the thousands who are fighting against the oppressive regime of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Our beloved country is in turmoil, and the world needs to hear our cries for justice and freedom. Government Violations and Brutality The current government, under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina, has shown blatant disregard for human rights and democratic values. In recent times, we have witnessed an unprecedented level of state-sponsored violence and suppression. The government's student wing, known as the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), has been instrumental in silencing dissent and terrorizing those who dare to speak out against the regime. State-Sponsored Violence The police, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), army, and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) have been deployed not to protect the citizens but to crush the voices of opposition. In a shocking display of brutality, these forces have opened fire on peaceful student protesters. Official records indicate that nearly 200 individuals have lost their lives, but the reality is far grimmer. Unofficial reports suggest that the death toll exceeds 2000, with many more injured and missing. The Role of the Student League The Bangladesh Chhatra League, operating with impunity under the protection of the government, has become synonymous with violence and intimidation. This organization has been involved in numerous attacks on students, journalists, and activists, further destabilizing an already fragile democracy. Their actions are not only a violation of human rights but also an affront to the very principles of education and free thought. A Cry for International Intervention Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's regime is a textbook example of fascism, where power is maintained through fear, violence, and suppression of dissent. The international community must not turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed in Bangladesh. We call upon global leaders, human rights organizations, and the United Nations to take immediate and decisive action to hold the Bangladeshi government accountable for its actions. The Path Forward The youth of Bangladesh are not terrorists; we are students yearning for a future where our voices can be heard, where our rights are respected, and where democracy can flourish. We seek a nation where justice prevails over tyranny, where education is a right and not a privilege granted by those in power. In conclusion, I urge the international media and human rights organizations to amplify our voices. The situation in Bangladesh is dire, and immediate intervention is crucial. The world must stand with us in our fight for freedom, justice, and democracy. Promit Dhaka Bangladesh

When #Bangladesh was newly formed, there was severe famine there and people were dying of hunger. At that time, Swami Prabhupad, the founder of ISKCON, appealed to his followers Pandit Ravi Shankar of Bengali origin and George Harrison, the founder of the famous band Beatles, that we should help the hungry people of Bangladesh. After that, George Harrison and Ravi Shankar organized the Save Bangladesh Live Show Live Concert at Madison Square in New York. 2.5 lakh dollars were collected in the first show, which ISKCON provided to the hungry people of Bangladesh. After that, within 3 months, ISKCON, with the help of George Harrison and Pandit Ravi Shankar, collected 25 lakh dollars from all over the world for the hungry and naked people of Bangladesh. This amount was very big in 1971. After that, more than one lakh people were fed in the ISKCON temple of Dhaka for several months. Not only this, the people of ISKCON used to carry food in vehicles and give it to hungry people all over Bangladesh. And today this ungrateful community has forgotten the favor of ISKCON which gave food and clothes to the hungry and naked. They burnt every brick of the huge ISKCON temple. While the stomachs of the hungry and naked people of Bangladesh were filled from this temple for 2 years.

2,919,332	"Smt Jaya Bachan Hon. MP raised very important issue in the Parliament, for which we salute her for her speech reproduced as under; ‚ÄúKill Senior Citizens. Govt should kill all sr. citizens after the age of 65 because Govt is not ready to pay attention to these nation builders. ""Is it a crime to be a sr citizen in India? Sr citizens of India are not eligible for medical insurance after 70 years, they do not get loan on EMI. Driving license is not issued. They are not given any work, hence they depend on others for survival .They had paid all the taxes, insurance premiums upto the age of retirement ie 60-65. Now even after becoming sr citizens, they have to pay all the taxes. There is no scheme for sr citizens in India. 50% discount on railways/air travel, has also been discontinued. The other side of the picture is that sr citizens in politics MLA, MP or Minister, are given every possible benefit and they also get pensions. I fail to understand why all others (except some Govt employees) are denied the same facilities. Imagine, if the children are not caring about them ,where will they go. If the elders of the country go against the Govt in elections, it will affect the election results . Government will have to face the consequences. Srs have the power to change the government, don't ignore them. They have the life long experience to change the Govt. Don't consider them weak ! So many schemes are required for the benefits of seniors . The govt spends a lot of money on welfare schemes, but never realizes about sr citizens. On the contrary, the income of sr citizens is decreasing due to reduction in interest rates of banks. If some of them are getting a meager pension to support the family & self, it is also subject to income tax. So sr citizens should be considered for some benefits : (1). All citizens above 60 must be given pension (2). Everybody must be given pension as per status (3). Concession in railway, bus & air travel. (4). Insurance should be must for all upto the last breath & premium must be paid by the Govt. (5). Court cases of sr citizens must be given priority for early decision. (6). Sr. citizens homes in every city with all facilities (7). Govt should amend the rule of scrapping 10 -15 yrs old used cars.This rule should be applied only for commercial vehicles. Our cars are purchased on loan & our uses are only 40 to 50000 km in 10 yrs. Our cars are as good as new one. If our cars are scrapped, then we must be given new cars. I request all Sr citizens and youth to share it on all social media. Let's hope that this government, who is sincere all the time and talks of *""Sab ka saath, sab ka vikas""* will do some for the betterment of those who have contributed in nation building and are now past their prime."" Please share with your friends, sr citizens and well wishers."

What I am saying is this - Anarchy in India has been green lighted and fast forwarded by the US Deep State. There is no teeth in the recent Hindenburg report - it need not be. There needs to be perception of a ‚Äúscam‚Äù and a report from a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù guy to give it credence. One cannot bring about stock market swings on a regular basis citing foreign reports - so it was time to attack the institution. To make investors lose faith.

As he stood there, at the door of his First Class Cabin in the Steam-liner, he noticed a lot of activity on the lower decks of the Ship. On enquiring, he learnt that a great Indian Saint Swami Vivekananda was on board the same ship. Out of genuine respect and curiosity J.N. Tata decided to pay a visit to the great saint. Swami Vivekananda had of-course heard about the respected industrialist. As the conversation grew J.N. Tata explained that he was on his way to Germany. ""I have with me several sacks of soil, from various parts of India. I am taking these samples of soil to Germany. I wish to know if Iron can be extracted profitably from any of these districts."" said J.N. Tata to the Saint. To which Swami Vivekananda replied, ""Well, Sir, even if these sacks contain Iron-rich soil, do you honestly believe that the Germans will tell you the TRUTH??? You must understand that NONE of the European Nations wish to see a Strong / Steel-Rich / Economically Independent India. The soil is probably rich in Iron-ore but the sad truth is all you will get from your enquiries across Europe is *Disbelief and Pessimistic reactions.*"" Needless to say, having interacted with several Europeans J.N. Tata knew this to be true. Swami Vivekananda continued, *""Why don't you start an excellent & up-to-date Research Facility and College in India???* Why don't you train some good Indian Youngsters to identify soil and conduct these tests and find ways of profitably extracting metals??? It may seem like a wasteful, burdensome expenditure right now. But in the long run it will save you many trips to Europe and you can have the assurance of knowing the Truth quickly, rather than taking multiple opinions due to suspicion & doubt"". As he could clearly sense J.N. Tata's mood was in acquiescence Swami Vivekananda further elaborated, ""Seek an audience with the Maharaja of Mysore H.R.H. Wodeyar. Though a subordinate of the British, he will definitely help you in every way he can............ .....H.R.H. Wodeyar has been generous enough to sponsor my own trip to Chicago to attend the Parliament of Religions"". As soon as he returned to India, J.N. Tata headed straight for Mysore. And indeed H.R.H. Chamaraja Wodeyar did not disappoint him. The King granted 370 acres of land & also initial funding for the setting up of the Research Facility and College that J.N. Tata had envisioned and it was named, *THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE* When two Great brains interact, they come out with solutions for the Nation and for Generations to get benefitted. Thank you Sri J N Tata and Swami Vivekananda. üåπüôè One of the greatest contributions by the true sons of India. üáÆüá≥ üåª"

2,931,415	"What Jawaharlal Nehru did to his wife was so horrific that you will start hating Nehru after knowing it.. Congress party leaders are often heard on TV channels alleging that Prime Minister Modi left his wife. But do you know what Jawaharlal Nehru did to his wife? Jawaharlal Nehru's wife Kamala Nehru was suffering from TB... In those days, the fear of TB was just like the fear of AIDS today... because there was no cure for TB then and a person would die bit by bit... in agony and would become a skeleton... and no one would even go near a TB patient because TB spreads through the breath... People would admit the patients to a TB sanatorium built in a hilly area... Nehru admitted his wife to a sanatorium in Prague, Yugoslavia [today Czech Republic], with another person... Kamala Nehru kept waiting for death every moment alone in the TB sanatorium for ten years... but Nehru kept romancing Edwina Benton in Delhi... The most shameful thing is that during this time Nehru went to Britain many times but not even once did he go to Prague to inquire about his wife's health... When Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose came to know about it, he He went to Prague... and talked to the doctors about better treatment... The doctors in Prague said that there is a modern TB hospital in Busan, Switzerland where he can be treated well... Immediately Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose collected 70 thousand rupees in those days and got her admitted to a hospital in Busan, Switzerland by plane... But Kamala Nehru was actually very broken from the heart... She was sad that her husband had not come to her even once in the last ten years to inquire about her health and strangers were taking care of her... After being admitted in Busan for two months, Kamala Nehru died in Busan itself on 28 February 1936... Ten days before her death, Netaji Subhash Chandra had sent a telegram to Nehru asking him to come to Busan immediately... But Nehru did not come... Then Nehru was sent the news of his wife's death... Still Nehru did not even come to his wife's funeral... In the end Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose performed the last rites of Nehru's wife Kamala Nehru in Busan city of Switzerland. The person who behaved like this with his wife is called Chacha Nehru. ""National interest is paramount"" üí™üí™"

2,934,745	*A SOLDIER‚ÄôS FATHER* By : WING COMDR VENKI IYER The helicopter appeared over the late morning horizon. We were to receive Mr Lachhman Singh Rathore who was visiting our Flight Unit to perform the last rites of his son, Flying Officer Vikram Singh. Only the day before, I had sent the telegram, ‚ÄúDeeply regret to inform that your son Flying Officer Vikram Singh lost his life in a flying accident early this morning. Death was instantaneous.‚Äù It was the first time for me- to meet and manage the bereaved next of kin, in this case the Father of the brave officer. While most of the desolate family members insist on seeing the body, many a time there isn‚Äôt a body to show !! Flying Officer Vikram Singh‚Äôs remains were only a few kilos ‚Äìscrapped from what was left in the cockpit. We had to weigh the wooden coffin with wood and earth. The pilot brought the helicopter to a perfect touchdown. Soon Mr Lachhman Singh Rathor was helped down the ladder.A small and frail man he was, maybe of 80 years, clad in an immaculate dhoti. As I approached him, he asked in a quiet and dignified whisper, ‚ÄúAre you Venki, the Flight Commander?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes Sir.‚Äù ‚ÄúVikram had spoken to me about you. I‚Äôd like to speak to you alone for a minute.‚Äù We walked to the edge of the concrete apron. ‚ÄòI have lost a son, and you have lost a friend. I‚Äôm sure that you have taken great care in arranging the funeral. Please tell me when and where you want my presence and what you want me to do. I‚Äôll be there for everything. Later, I would like to meet Vikram‚Äôs friends, see his room and, if it is permitted, visit his work place. I then would like to return home tomorrow morning.‚Äù A commander couldn‚Äôt have given me clearer instructions. The funeral, with full military honours, was concluded by late afternoon. After the final echoes of the ‚ÄòLast Post‚Äô faded away, Lachhman Singh spent the evening talking to the Squadron Pilots. Vikram‚Äôs roommate took him to see Vikram‚Äôs room. Lachhman Singh desired to spend the night in his son‚Äôs room instead of the guest house we had reserved for him. Early next morning after a tour of the squadron area, my boss took him to his office. A while later, the staff car took Lachhman Singh to the civil airfield two hours away. As the car disappeared round the corner, I remarked to my Boss, ‚ÄúA brave man he is. Spoke to me like a General when he told me exactly what he expected from us during his stay here. I have never seen a more composed man on such an occasion. I admire him.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, Mr Lachhman Singh Rathore is a warrior in his own way. He sired three sons and has laid to rest all three of them. -His 1st son Captain Ghanshyam Singh of the Gurkha Rifles was killed in Ladakh in 1962 War. His 2nd son, Major Bir Singh, died along the Ichogil Canal in 1965 in an ambush. His youngest, the 3rd, Vikram Singh, who had the courage to join the Air Force, is also gone now, more to our country‚Äôs defence than All of us combined.‚Äù Yes, he is indeed a brave Indian ; in fact HE is MORE INDIAN than anyone else - His sacrifice can never ever be repaid by the Country !! He is almost a Martyr himself !! But our Great Nation does Not know this simple Giant -- India only knows that Super Rich Cricketers need to be conferred BHARAT RATNA while a bunch of media personal or actors & actresses need to be conferred PADMA VIBHUSHANs and PADMASHREEs ! But what about the ' Losers ' ? Those who have SIMPLY LOST their EVERYTHING to the Nation & to its Citizens? Like this Father of Three Brave Soldiers! ---------------- ( PLEASE DO PASS THIS ON TO EVERY SINGLE POLITICIAN, BUREAUCRAT AND EVERY SINGLE INDIAN CITIZEN WHO DOES NOT HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER IN THE ARMED FORCES -- THAT's THE LEAST WE CAN DO AS OUR ONLY TRIBUTE TO THIS FATHER) A story to be included in the school syllabus. A brave father of brave sons. How the country could repay its debt to him. We do not know.but We only pray. Those who support stone pelters should read this. Jai Hind üáÆüá≥

2,953,883	"In Japan , there is no Teacher's Day . One day, I asked my Japanese colleague , teacher Yamamota : - How do you celebrate Teacher's Day in Japan? Surprised by my question , he replied : - We don't have Teacher's Day . When I heard his reply , I wasn't sure whether I should believe him or not. A thought passed through my mind : "" Why a country , which is so advanced in economy, sciences and technology, is so disrespectful towards teachers and their work ? "" *** Once, after work , Yamamota invited me to his home . We took the metro since it was far away . It was the evening peak hour, and the wagons in the metro train were overcrowded . I managed to find a space to stand , holding tightly the overhead railing . Suddenly, the elderly man who was seated beside me offered me his seat. Not understanding this respectful behaviour of that elderly man , I declined but he was persistent and I was forced to sit . Once we were out of the metro , I asked Yamamota to explain what exactly the whitebeard did . Yamamota smiled and pointed towards the tag of teacher I was wearing and said : - This old man after seeing the tag of a teacher on you & as a sign of respect towards your status , offered you his seat . Since I was visiting Yamamota for the first time , I felt uncomfortable going there with empty hands so of buying a gift . I shared my thoughts with Yamamota , he supported the idea and said that little further, there is a shop for teachers , where one can purchase goods at reduced prices. Once again , I couldn't hold my emotions : - Privileges are offered only to teachers ? I asked . Confirming my words , Yamamota said : - In Japan, teaching is the most respected profession and the teacher is the most respected person. The Japanese entrepreneurs are very happy when teachers come to their shops, they consider it an honour . *** During my stay in Japan, I've observed multiple times the utmost respect of the Japanese towards teachers. They have special seats allocated for them in metro , there are special shops for them , teachers there don't line up in queue for tickets for whatever type of transport... That's why the Japanese teachers don't need a special day , ( as every day in their live is a celebration. ) Spread this story to everyone. Let the society grow to appreciate the teachers to this level . Re-tell this story to your colleagues so that their chests swell with pride .

Reason for this ban: University of Hiroshima's scientists researched and found that ""radio waves"" from microwave ovens cause greater harm to health over the last 20 yrs, than the US atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Sep 1945.

Experts found that food heated in  microwave ovens has very unhealthy vibrations and radiation.

All the factories of ""microwave ovens"" in Japan are being closed. 

S Korea announced plans to close all ""microwave ovens"" factories by 2021, and China by 2023.

A conference on cancer prevention held @ Kashira Cancer Center recommended:
1. No Refined oil
2. No Milk of animal origin (recommended soya milk)
3. No Food cubes (chicken broth spices like Maggie etc)
4. No Soda (32 pieces of sugar per liter)
5. No Refined sugar
6. No Microwave ovens
7. No mammogram before birth, except echocardiography
8. No Very narrow underwear and bra
10. Do not re-freeze thawed food. 
11. Do not drink chilled water kept in plastic bottles stored in the fridge. 
12. Avoid  deodorants used after shaving or baths because they cause cancer.

The conference advise adding these to your diet :
1. Vegetables
2. Honey moderately used instead of sugar
3. Plant proteins (beans instead of meat)
4. 2 cups of water at body temp on  empty stomach before brushing teeth
5. Food should be warm and not very hot
6. Aloe vera juice + ginger + parsley + celery + bromalin (Mix and drink on an empty stomach) 
7. Carrot juice daily
8. Tomato, garlic onion with meals

Note : The American Physicians Association found the causes of cancer:
1. Do not drink anything hot in plastic cups
2. Do not eat anything hot wrapped in paper or cardboard or in a plastic bag (eg fried potatoes)
3. Don't eat in plastic or microwave dishes

Note:
When plastic is exposed to heat, chemicals dat can cause 52  cancer types are released.

You must also avoid drinking all kinds of soft drinks such as ""Cola, Pepsi, Av, Fanta and all concentrated juices because cancer feeds on sugar. Eat fresh pineapples and avoid pineapple mix. Don't eat heavy food after 7pm. 

Drink more water in the morning and less in the evening. Do not take a horizontal position (lying down/sleep) immediately after eating.

1,677,904	"In mathematics, no number can be divided by all the numbers from 1 to 10,

But this one number is very strange, all the mathematicians in the world

Shocked.

This number was discovered by Indian mathematicians with their unwavering intelligence.

*See this number 2520.*

It seems to be one of many numbers,

But in reality, it is not, it is a number that has surprised many mathematicians around the world.

*This number can be divided by any number from 1 to 10.*

Whether even or odd

It sounds like really amazing and impossible numbers. Now, look at the table.

2520 √∑ 1 = 2520

2520 √∑ 2 = 1260

2520 √∑ 3 = 840

2520 √∑ 4 = 630

2520 √∑ 5 = 504

2520 √∑ 6 = 420

2520 √∑ 7 = 360

2520 √∑ 8 = 315

2520 √∑ 9 = 280

2520 √∑ 10 = 252

*The secret of the number 2520 is hidden in the multiplication of [7 √ó 30 √ó 12].*

With regard to the Indian Hindu year, the riddle of this 2520 number is solved,

It is the coefficient of this number.

Days of the week (7),

Days of the month (30)

And months in a year (12)

[7 √ó 30 √ó 12 = 2520] This is the characteristic and dominance of time.

Understand the value of toll fee receipt and use it!

Prof Ranjana Praveen Deshmukh, Head, Maharashtra State Consumer Safety Committee:
What is hidden in the toll booth receipt? And why save it? What are the benefits from it? Let's learn today.

 1. If your car suddenly stalls while moving on the toll road, the toll company is responsible for towing your car.

 2. If your car runs out of petrol or the battery dies on the express highway, the toll company is responsible for bringing petrol and an external battery to your car. You should make a call. You will get help within 10 minutes and 5 to 10 liters of petrol for free. If your car has a puncture, you can get help by contacting that number.

 3. In case of sudden breakdown of your car you or one of your companions should contact the phone number mentioned on the toll receipt.

 4. If one of your fellow passengers suddenly falls ill while you are traveling in the car, that person may require urgent hospitalization. At such times, the toll company is also responsible for getting an ambulance to your car.

Please share this information with as many people as possible. The biggest advantage of expressway is time saving
